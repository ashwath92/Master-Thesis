 <dc:description>  Scene understanding is a popular and challenging topic in both computer
vision and photogrammetry. Scene graph provides rich information for such scene
understanding. This paper presents a novel approach to infer such relations and
then to construct the scene graph. Support relations are estimated by
considering important, previously ignored information: the physical stability
and the prior support knowledge between object classes. In contrast to previous
methods for extracting support relations, the proposed approach generates more
accurate results, and does not require a pixel-wise semantic labeling of the
scene. The semantic scene graph which describes all the contextual relations
within the scene is constructed using this information. To evaluate the
accuracy of these graphs, multiple different measures are formulated. The
proposed algorithms are evaluated using the NYUv2 database. The results
demonstrate that the inferred support relations are more precise than
state-of-the-art. The scene graphs are compared against ground truth graphs.

 <dc:description>  This provocation paper provides an overview of the underlying optimisation
problem in the emerging field of Digital Manufacturing. Initially, this paper
discusses how the notion of Digital Manufacturing is transforming from a term
describing a suite of software tools for the integration of production and
design functions towards a more general concept incorporating computerised
manufacturing and supply chain processes, as well as information collection and
utilisation across the product life cycle. On this basis, we use the example of
one such manufacturing process, Additive Manufacturing, to identify an
integrated multi-objective optimisation problem underlying Digital
Manufacturing. Forming an opportunity for a concurrent application of data
science and optimisation, a set of challenges arising from this problem is
outlined.

 <dc:description>  Cache-aided coded multicast leverages side information at wireless edge
caches to efficiently serve multiple groupcast demands via common multicast
transmissions, leading to load reductions that are proportional to the
aggregate cache size. However, the increasingly unpredictable and personalized
nature of the content that users consume challenges the efficiency of existing
caching-based solutions in which only exact content reuse is explored. This
paper generalizes the cache-aided coded multicast problem to a source
compression with distributed side information problem that specifically
accounts for the correlation among the content files. It is shown how joint
file compression during the caching and delivery phases can provide load
reductions that go beyond those achieved with existing schemes. This is
accomplished through a lower bound on the fundamental rate-memory trade-off as
well as a correlation-aware achievable scheme, shown to significantly
outperform state-of-the-art correlation-unaware solutions, while approaching
the limiting rate-memory trade-off.

 <dc:title>A syntactic proof of decidability for the logic of bunched implication
  BI</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ramanayake, Revantha</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The logic of bunched implication BI provides a framework for reasoning about
resource composition and forms the basis for an assertion language of
separation logic which is used to reason about software programs. Propositional
BI is obtained by freely combining propositional intuitionistic logic and
multiplicative intuitionistic linear logic. It possesses an elegant proof
theory: its bunched calculus combines the sequent calculi for these logics.
Several natural extensions of BI have been shown as undecidable, e.g. Boolean
BI which replaces intuitionistic logic with classical logic. This makes the
decidability of BI, proved recently via an intricate semantical argument,
particularly noteworthy. However, a syntactic proof of decidability has thus
far proved elusive. We obtain such a proof here using a proof-theoretic
argument. The proof is technically interesting, accessible as it uses the usual
bunched calculus (it does not require any knowledge of the semantics of BI),
yields an implementable decision procedure and implies an upper bound on the
complexity of the logic.

 <dc:title>A Cheap Linear Attention Mechanism with Fast Lookups and Fixed-Size

 <dc:description>  The softmax content-based attention mechanism has proven to be very
beneficial in many applications of recurrent neural networks. Nevertheless it
suffers from two major computational limitations. First, its computations for
an attention lookup scale linearly in the size of the attended sequence.
Second, it does not encode the sequence into a fixed-size representation but
instead requires to memorize all the hidden states. These two limitations
restrict the use of the softmax attention mechanism to relatively small-scale
applications with short sequences and few lookups per sequence. In this work we
introduce a family of linear attention mechanisms designed to overcome the two
limitations listed above. We show that removing the softmax non-linearity from
the traditional attention formulation yields constant-time attention lookups
and fixed-size representations of the attended sequences. These properties make
these linear attention mechanisms particularly suitable for large-scale
applications with extreme query loads, real-time requirements and memory
constraints. Early experiments on a question answering task show that these
linear mechanisms yield significantly better accuracy results than no
attention, but obviously worse than their softmax alternative.

n/\log\log\log n)$ query time, which comes within an $O((\log\log n)^2)$ factor
of a lower bound due to \Patrascu{} and Demaine. The new structure is based on
a dynamic connectivity algorithm proposed by Thorup in an extended abstract at
STOC 2000, which left out some important details.

 <dc:description>  Automated segmentation of retinal blood vessels in label-free fundus images
entails a pivotal role in computed aided diagnosis of ophthalmic pathologies,
viz., diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive disorders and cardiovascular diseases.
The challenge remains active in medical image analysis research due to varied
distribution of blood vessels, which manifest variations in their dimensions of
physical appearance against a noisy background.
  In this paper we formulate the segmentation challenge as a classification
task. Specifically, we employ unsupervised hierarchical feature learning using
ensemble of two level of sparsely trained denoised stacked autoencoder. First
level training with bootstrap samples ensures decoupling and second level
ensemble formed by different network architectures ensures architectural
revision. We show that ensemble training of auto-encoders fosters diversity in
learning dictionary of visual kernels for vessel segmentation. SoftMax
classifier is used for fine tuning each member auto-encoder and multiple
strategies are explored for 2-level fusion of ensemble members. On DRIVE
dataset, we achieve maximum average accuracy of 95.33\% with an impressively
low standard deviation of 0.003 and Kappa agreement coefficient of 0.708 .
Comparison with other major algorithms substantiates the high efficacy of our
model.

 <dc:title>On the Phase Transition of Finding a Biclique in a larger Bipartite

 <dc:description>  We report on the phase transition of finding a complete subgraph, of
specified dimensions, in a bipartite graph. Finding a complete subgraph in a
bipartite graph is a problem that has growing attention in several domains,
including bioinformatics, social network analysis and domain clustering. A key
step for a successful phase transition study is identifying a suitable order
parameter, when none is known. To this purpose, we have applied a decision tree
classifier to real-world instances of this problem, in order to understand what
problem features separate an instance that is hard to solve from those that is
not. We have successfully identified one such order parameter and with it the
phase transition of finding a complete bipartite subgraph of specified
dimensions. Our phase transition study shows an
easy-to-hard-to-easy-to-hard-to-easy pattern. Further, our results indicate
that the hardest instances are in a region where it is more likely that the
corresponding bipartite graph will have a complete subgraph of specified
dimensions, a positive answer. By contrast, instances with a negative answer
are more likely to appear in a region where the computational cost is
negligible. This behaviour is remarkably similar for problems of a number of
different sizes.

 <dc:description>  A recent algorithmic family for distributed optimization, DIGing's, have been
shown to have geometric convergence over time-varying undirected/directed
graphs. Nevertheless, an identical step-size for all agents is needed. In this
paper, we study the convergence rates of the Adapt-Then-Combine (ATC) variation
of the DIGing algorithm under uncoordinated step-sizes. We show that the ATC
variation of DIGing algorithm converges geometrically fast even if the
step-sizes are different among the agents. In addition, our analysis implies
that the ATC structure can accelerate convergence compared to the distributed
gradient descent (DGD) structure which has been used in the original DIGing
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a concurrent learning based adaptive observer is developed for
a class of second-order linear time-invariant systems with uncertain system
matrices. The developed technique yields an exponentially convergent state
estimator and an exponentially convergent parameter estimator. As opposed to
persistent excitation required for parameter convergence in traditional
adaptive methods, excitation over a finite time-interval is sufficient for the
developed technique to achieve exponential convergence. Simulation results in
both noise-free and noisy environments are presented to validate the design.

 <dc:description>  This paper generalizes the Lasalle-Yoshizawa Theorem to switched nonsmooth
systems. Filippov and Krasovskii regularizations of a switched system are shown
to be contained within the convex hull of the Filippov and Krasovskii
regularizations of the subsystems, respectively. A candidate common Lyapunov
function that has a negative semidefinite derivative along the trajectories of
the subsystems is shown to be sufficient to establish LaSalle-Yoshizawa results
for the switched system. Results for regular and non-regular candidate Lyapunov
functions are presented using an appropriate generalization of the time
derivative. The developed generalization is motivated by adaptive control of
switched systems where the derivative of the candidate Lyapunov function is
typically negative semidefinite.

 <dc:description>  The Gaussian mixture model is a classic technique for clustering and data
modeling that is used in numerous applications. With the rise of big data,
there is a need for parameter estimation techniques that can handle streaming
data and distribute the computation over several processors. While online
variants of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm exist, their data
efficiency is reduced by a stochastic approximation of the E-step and it is not
clear how to distribute the computation over multiple processors. We propose a
Bayesian learning technique that lends itself naturally to online and
distributed computation. Since the Bayesian posterior is not tractable, we
project it onto a family of tractable distributions after each observation by
matching a set of sufficient moments. This Bayesian moment matching technique
compares favorably to online EM in terms of time and accuracy on a set of data
modeling benchmarks.

heavy demands on computational resources. In some neural network models, the
learning formulas, such as the Widrow-Hoff formula, do not change the
eigenvectors of the weight matrix while flatting the eigenvalues. In infinity,
this iterative formulas result in terms formed by the principal components of
the weight matrix: i.e., the eigenvectors corresponding to the non-zero
eigenvalues.
  In quantum computing, the phase estimation algorithm is known to provide
speed-ups over the conventional algorithms when it is used for the eigenvalue
related problems. Therefore, it is appealing to ask whether we can model such
learning formulas in quantum computing and gain a computational speed-up.
Combining the quantum amplitude amplification with the phase estimation
algorithm, a quantum implementation model for artificial neural networks using
the Widrow-Hoff learning rule is presented. In addition, the complexity of the
model is found to be linear in the size of the weight matrix. This provides a
quadratic improvement over the classical algorithms.

 <dc:description>  A central problem in data streams is to characterize which functions of an
underlying frequency vector can be approximated efficiently. Recently there has
been considerable effort in extending this problem to that of estimating
functions of a matrix that is presented as a data-stream. This setting
generalizes classical problems to the analogous ones for matrices. For example,
instead of estimating frequent-item counts, we now wish to estimate
&quot;frequent-direction&quot; counts. A related example is to estimate norms, which now
correspond to estimating a vector norm on the singular values of the matrix.
Despite recent efforts, the current understanding for such matrix problems is
considerably weaker than that for vector problems.
  We study a number of aspects of estimating matrix norms in a stream that have
not previously been considered: (1) multi-pass algorithms, (2) algorithms that
see the underlying matrix one row at a time, and (3) time-efficient algorithms.
Our multi-pass and row-order algorithms use less memory than what is provably
required in the single-pass and entrywise-update models, and thus give
separations between these models (in terms of memory). Moreover, all of our
algorithms are considerably faster than previous ones. We also prove a number
of lower bounds, and obtain for instance, a near-complete characterization of
the memory required of row-order algorithms for estimating Schatten $p$-norms
of sparse matrices.

 <dc:title>Ising spin model using Spin-Hall Effect (SHE) induced magnetization

 <dc:description>  Ising spin model is considered as an efficient computing method to solve
combinatorial optimization problems based on its natural tendency of
convergence towards low energy state. The underlying basic functions
facilitating the Ising model can be categorized into two parts, &quot;Annealing and
Majority vote&quot;. In this paper, we propose an Ising cell based on Spin Hall
Effect (SHE) induced magnetization switching in a Magnetic Tunnel Junction
(MTJ). The stochasticity of our proposed Ising cell based on SHE induced MTJ
switching, can implement the natural annealing process by preventing the system
from being stuck in solutions with local minima. Further, by controlling the
current through the Heavy-Metal (HM) underlying the MTJ, we can mimic the
majority vote function which determines the next state of the individual spins.
By solving coupled \textit{Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert} (LLG) equations, we
demonstrate that our Ising cell can be replicated to map certain combinatorial
problems. We present results for two representative problems - Maximum-cut and
Graph coloring - to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed device-circuit
configuration in solving combinatorial problems. Our proposed solution using a
Heavy Metal (HM) based MTJ device can be exploited to implement compact, fast,
and energy efficient Ising spin model.

 <dc:description>  Kerr nonlinear cavities displaying optical thresholding have been proposed
for the realization of ultra-low power photonic logic gates. In the ultra-low
photon number regime, corresponding to energy levels in the attojoule scale,
quantum input-output models become important to study the effect of unavoidable
quantum fluctuations on the performance of such logic gates. However, being a
quantum anharmonic oscillator, a Kerr-cavity has an infinite dimensional
Hilbert space spanned by the Fock states of the oscillator. This poses a
challenge to simulate and analyze photonic logic gates and circuits composed of
multiple Kerr nonlinearities. For simulation, the Hilbert of the oscillator is
typically truncated to the span of only a finite number of Fock states. This
paper develops a quasi-principal components approach to identify important
subspaces of a Kerr-cavity Hilbert space and exploits it to construct an
approximate reduced model of the Kerr-cavity on a smaller Hilbert space. Using
this approach, we find a reduced dimension model with a Hilbert space dimension
of 15 that can closely match the magnitudes of the mean transmitted and
reflected output fields of a conventional truncated Fock state model of
dimension 75, when driven by an input coherent field that switches between two
levels. For the same input, the reduced model also closely matches the
magnitudes of the mean output fields of Kerr-cavity-based AND and NOT gates and
a NAND latch obtained from simulation of the full 75 dimension model.

 <dc:description>  Studying information diffusion and the spread of goods in the real world and
in many digital services can be extremely difficult since information about the
information flows is challenging to accurately track. How information spreads
has commonly been analysed from the perspective of homophily, social influence,
and initial seed selection. However, in virtual worlds and virtual economies,
the movements of information and goods can be precisely tracked. Therefore,
these environments create laboratories for the accurate study of information
diffusion characteristics that have been difficult to study in prior research.
In this paper, we study how content visibility as well as sender and receiver
characteristics, the relationship between them, and the types of multilayer
social network layers affect content absorption and diffusion in virtual world.
The results show that prior visibility of distributed content is the strongest
predictor of content adoption and its further spread across networks. Among
other analysed factors, the mechanics of diffusion, content quality, and
content adoption by users neighbours on the social activity layer had very
strong influences on the adoption of new content.

 <dc:title>A simple algorithm for sampling colourings of $G(n,d/n)$ up to Gibbs
  Uniqueness Threshold</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Approximate random $k$-colouring of a graph $G$ is a well studied problem in
computer science and statistical physics. It amounts to constructing a
$k$-colouring of $G$ which is distributed close to {\em Gibbs distribution} in
polynomial time. Here, we deal with the problem when the underlying graph is an
instance of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,d/n)$, where $d$ is a
sufficiently large constant.
  We propose a novel efficient algorithm for approximate random $k$-colouring
$G(n,d/n)$ for any $k\geq (1+\epsilon)d$. To be more specific, with probability
at least $1-n^{-\Omega(1)}$ over the input instances $G(n,d/n)$ and for $k\geq
(1+\epsilon)d$, the algorithm returns a $k$-colouring which is distributed
within total variation distance $n^{-\Omega(1)}$ from the Gibbs distribution of
the input graph instance.
  The algorithm we propose is neither a MCMC one nor inspired by the message
passing algorithms proposed by statistical physicists. Roughly the idea is as
follows: Initially we remove sufficiently many edges of the input graph. This
results in a &quot;simple graph&quot; which can be $k$-coloured randomly efficiently. The
algorithm colours randomly this simple graph. Then it puts back the removed
edges one by one. Every time a new edge is put back the algorithm updates the
colouring of the graph so that the colouring remains random.
  The performance of the algorithm depends heavily on certain spatial
correlation decay properties of the Gibbs distribution.

recognizers. We propose a novel symbol inventory, and a novel iterated-CTC
method in which a second system is used to transform a noisy initial output
into a cleaner version. We present a number of stabilization and initialization
methods we have found useful in training these networks. We evaluate our system
on the commonly used NIST 2000 conversational telephony test set, and
significantly exceed the previously published performance of similar systems,
both with and without the use of an external language model and decoding

 <dc:title>Two limitations of our knowledge of quality</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Reich, Johannes</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This article develops a quality notion that is complementary to the system
notion. As a major consequence, it becomes clear why quality can be measured
only to a certain extend based on the issues of validity and incompleteness.
First, there is an inherent conflict between the applicability and validity of
quality measures and second, quality considerations almost always refer to
high-dimensional spaces with only sparse knowledge also known as &quot;curse of
dimensionality&quot;. The resulting gap of knowledge has to be filled by experienced
based heuristics. To deal with the curse of dimensionality, the heuristics of
categorizing qualities into strategic and necessary is proposed. Strategic
qualities provide contrast, while necessary qualities rather diminish contrast.
In an economic context the presence of strategic qualities motivate a
buy-decision and the absence of necessary qualities motivate a
don't-buy-decision.

 <dc:title>On the Convex Geometry of Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hosseini, Seyedroohollah</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Low-rank matrix approximation, which aims to construct a low-rank matrix from
an observation, has received much attention recently. An efficient method to
solve this problem is to convert the problem of rank minimization into a
nuclear norm minimization problem. However, soft-thresholding of singular
values leads to the elimination of important information about the sensed
matrix. Weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) has been proposed, where the
singular values are assigned different weights, in order to treat singular
values differently. In this paper the solution for WNNM is analyzed under a
particular weighting condition using the connection between convex geometry and
compressed sensing algorithms. It is shown that the WNNM is convex where the
weights are in non-descending order and there is a unique global minimizer for
the minimization problem.

 <dc:description>  Classical objectives in two-player zero-sum games played on graphs often deal
with limit behaviors of infinite plays: e.g., mean-payoff and total-payoff in
the quantitative setting, or parity in the qualitative one (a canonical way to
encode omega-regular properties). Those objectives offer powerful abstraction
mechanisms and often yield nice properties such as memoryless determinacy.
However, their very nature provides no guarantee on time bounds within which
something good can be witnessed. In this work, we consider two approaches
toward inclusion of time bounds in parity games. The first one, parity-response
games, is based on the notion of finitary parity games [CHH09] and parity games
with costs [FZ14,WZ16]. The second one, window parity games, is inspired by
window mean-payoff games [CDRR15]. We compare the two approaches and show that
while they prove to be equivalent in some contexts, window parity games offer a
more tractable alternative when the time bound is given as a parameter (P-c.
vs. PSPACE-C.). In particular, it provides a conservative approximation of
parity games computable in polynomial time. Furthermore, we extend both
approaches to the multi-dimension setting. We give the full picture for both
types of games with regard to complexity and memory bounds.

 <dc:description>  General predictive models do not provide a measure of confidence in
predictions without Bayesian assumptions. A way to circumvent potential
restrictions is to use conformal methods for constructing non-parametric
confidence regions, that offer guarantees regarding validity. In this paper we
provide a detailed description of a computationally efficient conformal
procedure for Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), and conduct a comparative
numerical study to see how well conformal regions perform against the Bayesian
confidence sets. The results suggest that conformalized KRR can yield
predictive confidence regions with specified coverage rate, which is essential
in constructing anomaly detection systems based on predictive models.

 <dc:description>  Recent progress in randomized motion planners has led to the development of a
new class of sampling-based algorithms that provide asymptotic optimality
guarantees, notably the RRT* and the PRM* algorithms. Careful analysis reveals
that the so-called &quot;rewiring&quot; step in these algorithms can be interpreted as a
local policy iteration (PI) step (i.e., a local policy evaluation step followed
by a local policy improvement step) so that asymptotically, as the number of
samples tend to infinity, both algorithms converge to the optimal path almost
surely (with probability 1). Policy iteration, along with value iteration (VI)
are common methods for solving dynamic programming (DP) problems. Based on this
observation, recently, the RRT$^{\#}$ algorithm has been proposed, which
performs, during each iteration, Bellman updates (aka &quot;backups&quot;) on those
vertices of the graph that have the potential of being part of the optimal path
(i.e., the &quot;promising&quot; vertices). The RRT$^{\#}$ algorithm thus utilizes
dynamic programming ideas and implements them incrementally on randomly
generated graphs to obtain high quality solutions. In this work, and based on
this key insight, we explore a different class of dynamic programming
algorithms for solving shortest-path problems on random graphs generated by
iterative sampling methods. These class of algorithms utilize policy iteration
instead of value iteration, and thus are better suited for massive
parallelization. Contrary to the RRT* algorithm, the policy improvement during
the rewiring step is not performed only locally but rather on a set of vertices
that are classified as &quot;promising&quot; during the current iteration. This tends to
speed-up the whole process. The resulting algorithm, aptly named Policy
Iteration-RRT$^{\#}$ (PI-RRT$^{\#}$) is the first of a new class of DP-inspired
algorithms for randomized motion planning that utilize PI methods.

 <dc:description>  Identifying important nodes in complex networks is a fundamental problem in
network analysis. Although a plethora of measures has been proposed to identify
important nodes in static (i.e., time-invariant) networks, there is a lack of
tools in the context of temporal networks (i.e., networks whose connectivity
dynamically changes over time). The aim of this paper is to propose a
system-theoretic approach for identifying important nodes in temporal networks.
In this direction, we first propose a generalization of the popular Katz
centrality measure to the family of Markovian temporal networks using tools
from the theory of Markov jump linear systems. We then show that Katz
centrality in Markovian temporal networks can be efficiently computed using
linear programming. Finally, we propose a convex program for optimizing the
Katz centrality of a given node by tuning the weights of the temporal network
in a cost-efficient manner. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness
of the obtained results.

 <dc:description>  Emerging fifth generation (5G) wireless networks require massive bandwidth in
higher frequency bands, extreme network densities, and flexibility of
supporting multiple wireless technologies in order to provide higher data rates
and seamless coverage. It is expected that utilization of the large bandwidth
in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band and deployment of heterogeneous networks
(HetNets) will help address the data rate requirements of 5G networks. However,
high pathloss and shadowing in the mmWave frequency band, strong interference
in the HetNets due to massive network densification, and coor- dination of
various air interfaces are challenges that must be addressed. In this paper, we
consider a relay-based multiband orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA) HetNet in which mmWave small cells are deployed within the service area
of macro cells. Specifically, we attempt to exploit the distinct propagation
characteristics of mmWave bands (i.e., 60 GHz- the V-band - and 70-80 GHz -the
E-band-) and the Long Term Evolution (LTE) band to maximize overall data rate
of the network via efficient resource allocation. The problem is solved using a
modified dual decomposition approach and then a low complexity greedy solution
based on iterative activity selection algorithm is presented. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach outperforms conventional schemes.

 <dc:description>  It is impossible to effectively modify a string in order to increase its
Kolmogorov complexity. But is it possible to construct a few strings, not
longer than the input string, so that most of them have larger complexity? We
show that the answer is yes. We present an algorithm that on input a string $x$
of length $n$ returns a list with $O(n^2)$ many strings, all of length $n$,
such that 99\% of them are more complex than $x$, provided the complexity of
$x$ is less than $n - \log \log n - O(1)$. We obtain similar results for other
parameters, including a polynomial-time construction.

 <dc:description>  Recommendation emails are among the best ways to re-engage with customers
after they have left a website. While on-site recommendation systems focus on
finding the most relevant items for a user at the moment (right item), email
recommendations add two critical additional dimensions: who to send
recommendations to (right person) and when to send them (right time). It is
critical that a recommendation email system not send too many emails to too
many users in too short of a time-window, as users may unsubscribe from future
emails or become desensitized and ignore future emails if they receive too
many. Also, email service providers may mark such emails as spam if too many of
their users are contacted in a short time-window. Optimizing email
recommendation systems such that they can yield a maximum response rate for a
minimum number of email sends is thus critical for the long-term performance of
such a system. In this paper, we present a novel recommendation email system
that not only generates recommendations, but which also leverages a combination
of individual user activity data, as well as the behavior of the group to which
they belong, in order to determine each user's likelihood to respond to any
given set of recommendations within a given time period. In doing this, we have
effectively created a meta-recommendation system which recommends sets of
recommendations in order to optimize the aggregate response rate of the entire
system. The proposed technique has been applied successfully within
CareerBuilder's job recommendation email system to generate a 50\% increase in
total conversions while also decreasing sent emails by 72%

 <dc:description>  We present a method to incorporate global orientation information from the
sun into a visual odometry pipeline using only the existing image stream, where
the sun is typically not visible. We leverage recent advances in Bayesian
Convolutional Neural Networks to train and implement a sun detection model that
infers a three-dimensional sun direction vector from a single RGB image.
Crucially, our method also computes a principled uncertainty associated with
each prediction, using a Monte Carlo dropout scheme. We incorporate this
uncertainty into a sliding window stereo visual odometry pipeline where
accurate uncertainty estimates are critical for optimal data fusion. Our
Bayesian sun detection model achieves a median error of approximately 12
degrees on the KITTI odometry benchmark training set, and yields improvements
of up to 42% in translational ARMSE and 32% in rotational ARMSE compared to
standard VO. An open source implementation of our Bayesian CNN sun estimator
(Sun-BCNN) using Caffe is available at https://github.

 <dc:description>  Graham and Pollak showed that the vertices of any connected graph $G$ can be
assigned $t$-tuples with entries in $\{0, a, b\}$, called addresses, such that
the distance in $G$ between any two vertices equals the number of positions in
their addresses where one of the addresses equals $a$ and the other equals $b$.
In this paper, we are interested in determining the minimum value of such $t$
for various families of graphs. We develop two ways to obtain this value for
the Hamming graphs and present a lower bound for the triangular graphs.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and energy
storage devices in the power system, it is important to evaluate the cost of
the system by using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). In this paper a new
metric, Levelized Cost of Delivery (LCOD) is proposed to calculate the LCOE for
the energy storage. The recent definitions in LCOE for renewable energy system
has been reviewed. From fundamental principles, it is demonstrated that there
is a need to introduce a new method to evaluate LCOE of the system as the
conventional LCOE is not applicable for renewable energy storage systems. Three
years of solar irradiance data in Africa collected from Johannesburg and the
national load data from Kenya are obtained for case studies. The proposed cost
calculation methods are evaluated for two types of storage technologies
(Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) and Lithium-ion) with real-life data. It shows
that the marginal LCOE and LCOD indices can be used to assist policymakers to
consider the discount rate and the type of storage technology for a cost
effective renewable storage energy system.

 <dc:description>  Crowdsourcing platforms have become quite popular due to the increasing
demand of human computation-based tasks. Though the crowdsourcing systems are
primarily demand-driven like MTurk, supply-driven marketplaces are becoming
increasingly popular. Fiverr is a fast growing supply-driven marketplace where
the sellers post micro-tasks (gigs) and users purchase them for prices as low
as $5. In this paper, we study the Fiverr platform as a unique marketplace and
characterize the sellers, buyers and the interactions among them. We find that
sellers are more appeasing in their interactions and try to woo their buyers
into buying their gigs. There are many small tightly-knit communities existing
in the seller-seller network who support each other. We also study Fiverr as a
seller-driven marketplace in terms of sales, churn rates, competitiveness among
various sub-categories etc. and observe that while there are certain
similarities with common marketplaces there are also many differences.

 <dc:title>A Novel Approach to Implement Message Level Security in RESTful Web
  Services</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The world is rapidly adopting RESTful web services for most of its tasks. The
once popular SOAP-based web services are fast losing ground owing to this.
RESTful web services are light weight services without strict message formats.
RESTful web services, unlike SOAP, are capable of message transfer in any
format be it XML, JSON, plain text. However, in spite of these positives,
ensuring message level security in REST is a challenge. Security in RESTful web
services is still largely dependent upon transport layer security. There has
been some work recently towards message level security in such environments
wherein the transfer of message level security metadata is done through
utilising new HTTP headers. We feel, however, that any method that compromises
the generality of the HTTP protocol should be avoided. In this paper,
therefore, we propose two new ways of encryption that promise to ensure message
level security in RESTful web services without the need for special HTTP
headers. This approach works seamlessly on most famous content-types of RESTful
web services: XML, JSON, HTML, plain-text and various ASCII printable content
types. Further, the proposed approach removes the need for content negotiation
in cases where the content comprises XML, JSON, HTML, plain-text, and ASCII
printable content types and also removes the need for XML or JSON
canonicalization.

 <dc:description>  Click through rate (CTR) prediction of image ads is the core task of online
display advertising systems, and logistic regression (LR) has been frequently
applied as the prediction model. However, LR model lacks the ability of
extracting complex and intrinsic nonlinear features from handcrafted
high-dimensional image features, which limits its effectiveness. To solve this
issue, in this paper, we introduce a novel deep neural network (DNN) based
model that directly predicts the CTR of an image ad based on raw image pixels
and other basic features in one step. The DNN model employs convolution layers
to automatically extract representative visual features from images, and
nonlinear CTR features are then learned from visual features and other
contextual features by using fully-connected layers. Empirical evaluations on a
real world dataset with over 50 million records demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of this method.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a formalism to couple integrity constraints over general-purpose
knowledge bases with actions that can be executed to restore consistency. This
formalism generalizes active integrity constraints over databases. In the more
general setting of multi-context systems, adding repair suggestions to
integrity constraints allows defining simple iterative algorithms to find all
possible grounded repairs - repairs for the global system that follow the
suggestions given by the actions in the individual rules. We apply our
methodology to ontologies, and show that it can express most relevant types of
integrity constraints in this domain.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with tomographic image reconstruction under the situation
where some of projection data bins are contaminated with abnormal data. Such
situations occur in various instances of tomography. We propose a new
reconstruction algorithm called the Fault-Tolerant reconstruction outlined as
follows. The least-squares (L2-norm) error function ||Ax-b||_2^2 used in
ordinary iterative reconstructions is sensitive to the existence of abnormal
data. The proposed algorithm utilizes the L1-norm error function ||Ax-b||_1^1
instead of the L2-norm, and we develop a row-action-type iterative algorithm
using the proximal splitting framework in convex optimization fields. We also
propose an improved version of the L1-norm reconstruction called the L1-TV
reconstruction, in which a weak Total Variation (TV) penalty is added to the
cost function. Simulation results demonstrate that reconstructed images with
the L2-norm were severely damaged by the effect of abnormal bins, whereas
images with the L1-norm and L1-TV reconstructions were robust to the existence
of abnormal bins.

 <dc:description>  The human activity recognition in the IoT environment plays the central role
in the ambient assisted living, where the human activities can be represented
as a concatenated event stream generated from various smart objects. From the
concatenated event stream, each activity should be distinguished separately for
the human activity recognition to provide services that users may need. In this
regard, accurately segmenting the entire stream at the precise boundary of each
activity is indispensable high priority task to realize the activity
recognition. Multiple human activities in an IoT environment generate varying
event stream patterns, and the unpredictability of these patterns makes them
include redundant or missing events. In dealing with this complex segmentation
problem, we figured out that the dynamic and confusing patterns cause major
problems due to: inclusive event stream, redundant events, and shared events.
To address these problems, we exploited the contextual relationships associated
with the activity status about either ongoing or terminated/started. To
discover the intrinsic relationships between the events in a stream, we
utilized the LSTM model by rendering it for the activity segmentation. Then,
the inferred boundaries were revised by our validation algorithm for a bit
shifted boundaries. Our experiments show the surprising result of high accuracy
above 95%, on our own testbed with various smart objects. This is superior to
the prior works that even do not assume the environment with multi-user
activities, where their accuracies are slightly above 80% in their test
environment. It proves that our work is feasible enough to be applied in the
IoT environment.

 <dc:description>  Audio Event Detection (AED) aims to recognize sounds within audio and video
recordings. AED employs machine learning algorithms commonly trained and tested
on annotated datasets. However, available datasets are limited in number of
samples and hence it is difficult to model acoustic diversity. Therefore, we
propose combining labeled audio from a dataset and unlabeled audio from the web
to improve the sound models. The audio event detectors are trained on the
labeled audio and ran on the unlabeled audio downloaded from YouTube. Whenever
the detectors recognized any of the known sounds with high confidence, the
unlabeled audio was use to re-train the detectors. The performance of the
re-trained detectors is compared to the one from the original detectors using
the annotated test set. Results showed an improvement of the AED, and uncovered
challenges of using web audio from videos.

 <dc:description>  Mobile-edge computing (MEC) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm to
liberate mobile devices from increasingly intensive computation workloads, as
well as to improve the quality of computation experience. In this paper, we
investigate the tradeoff between two critical but conflicting objectives in
multi-user MEC systems, namely, the power consumption of mobile devices and the
execution delay of computation tasks. A power consumption minimization problem
with task buffer stability constraints is formulated to investigate the
tradeoff, and an online algorithm that decides the local execution and
computation offloading policy is developed based on Lyapunov optimization.
Specifically, at each time slot, the optimal frequencies of the local CPUs are
obtained in closed forms, while the optimal transmit power and bandwidth
allocation for computation offloading are determined with the Gauss-Seidel
method. Performance analysis is conducted for the proposed algorithm, which
indicates that the power consumption and execution delay obeys an [O (1/V); O
(V)] tradeoff with V as a control parameter. Simulation results are provided to
validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the impacts of various
parameters to the system performance.

 <dc:description>  Reasoning and inference are central to human and artificial intelligence.
Modeling inference in human language is very challenging. With the availability
of large annotated data (Bowman et al., 2015), it has recently become feasible
to train neural network based inference models, which have shown to be very
effective. In this paper, we present a new state-of-the-art result, achieving
the accuracy of 88.6% on the Stanford Natural Language Inference Dataset.
Unlike the previous top models that use very complicated network architectures,
we first demonstrate that carefully designing sequential inference models based
on chain LSTMs can outperform all previous models. Based on this, we further
show that by explicitly considering recursive architectures in both local
inference modeling and inference composition, we achieve additional
improvement. Particularly, incorporating syntactic parsing information
contributes to our best result---it further improves the performance even when
added to the already very strong model.

 <dc:description>  This paper concerns iterative reconstruction for low-dose and few-view CT by
minimizing a data-fidelity term regularized with the Total Variation (TV)
penalty. We propose a very fast iterative algorithm to solve this problem. The
algorithm derivation is outlined as follows. First, the original minimization
problem is reformulated into the saddle point (primal-dual) problem by using
the Lagrangian duality, to which we apply the first-order primal-dual iterative
methods. Second, we precondition the iteration formula using the ramp flter of
Filtered Backprojection (FBP) reconstruction algorithm in such a way that the
problem solution is not altered. The resulting algorithm resembles the
structure of so-called iterative FBP algorithm, and it converges to the exact
minimizer of cost function very fast.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses automatic quality assessment of spoken language
translation (SLT). This relatively new task is defined and formalized as a
sequence labeling problem where each word in the SLT hypothesis is tagged as
good or bad according to a large feature set. We propose several word
confidence estimators (WCE) based on our automatic evaluation of transcription
(ASR) quality, translation (MT) quality, or both (combined ASR+MT). This
research work is possible because we built a specific corpus which contains
6.7k utterances for which a quintuplet containing: ASR output, verbatim
transcript, text translation, speech translation and post-edition of
translation is built. The conclusion of our multiple experiments using joint
ASR and MT features for WCE is that MT features remain the most influent while
ASR feature can bring interesting complementary information. Our robust quality
estimators for SLT can be used for re-scoring speech translation graphs or for
providing feedback to the user in interactive speech translation or
computer-assisted speech-to-text scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm provides many features including
hardware abstraction, programmable networking and centralized policy control.
One of the main benefits used along with these features is core/backhaul
network virtualization which ensures sharing of mobile core and backhaul
networks among Mobile Operators (MOs). In this paper, we propose a virtualized
SDN-based Evolved Packet System (EPS) cellular network architecture including
design of network virtualization controller. After virtualization of
core/backhaul network elements, eNodeBs associated with MOs become a part of
resource allocation problem for Backhaul Transport Providers (BTPs). We
investigate the performance of our proposed architecture where eNodeBs are
assigned to the MOs using quality-of-service (QoS)-aware and QoS-unaware
scheduling algorithms under the consideration of time-varying numbers and
locations of user equipments (UEs) through Monte-Carlo simulations. The
performances are compared with traditional EPS in Long Term Evolution (LTE)
architecture and the results reveal that our proposed architecture outperforms
the traditional cellular network architecture.

 <dc:description>  Change detection is one of the most challenging issues when analyzing
remotely sensed images. Comparing several multi-date images acquired through
the same kind of sensor is the most common scenario. Conversely, designing
robust, flexible and scalable algorithms for change detection becomes even more
challenging when the images have been acquired by two different kinds of
sensors. This situation arises in case of emergency under critical constraints.
This paper presents, to the best of authors' knowledge, the first strategy to
deal with optical images characterized by dissimilar spatial and spectral
resolutions. Typical considered scenarios include change detection between
panchromatic or multispectral and hyperspectral images. The proposed strategy
consists of a 3-step procedure: i) inferring a high spatial and spectral
resolution image by fusion of the two observed images characterized one by a
low spatial resolution and the other by a low spectral resolution, ii)
predicting two images with respectively the same spatial and spectral
resolutions as the observed images by degradation of the fused one and iii)
implementing a decision rule to each pair of observed and predicted images
characterized by the same spatial and spectral resolutions to identify changes.
The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on real images with
simulated realistic changes.

 <dc:description>  Archetypal scenarios for change detection generally consider two images
acquired through sensors of the same modality. However, in some specific cases
such as emergency situations, the only images available may be those acquired
through different kinds of sensors. More precisely, this paper addresses the
problem of detecting changes between two multi-band optical images
characterized by different spatial and spectral resolutions. This sensor
dissimilarity introduces additional issues in the context of operational change
detection. To alleviate these issues, classical change detection methods are
applied after independent preprocessing steps (e.g., resampling) used to get
the same spatial and spectral resolutions for the pair of observed images.
Nevertheless, these preprocessing steps tend to throw away relevant
information. Conversely, in this paper, we propose a method that more
effectively uses the available information by modeling the two observed images
as spatial and spectral versions of two (unobserved) latent images
characterized by the same high spatial and high spectral resolutions. As they
cover the same scene, these latent images are expected to be globally similar
except for possible changes in sparse spatial locations. Thus, the change
detection task is envisioned through a robust multi-band image fusion method
which enforces the differences between the estimated latent images to be
spatially sparse. This robust fusion problem is formulated as an inverse
problem which is iteratively solved using an efficient block-coordinate descent
algorithm. The proposed method is applied to real panchormatic/multispectral
and hyperspectral images with simulated realistic changes. A comparison with
state-of-the-art change detection methods evidences the accuracy of the
proposed strategy.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results across many language
processing tasks, however these methods are highly sensitive to noise and
adversarial attacks. We present a regularization based method for limiting
network sensitivity to its inputs, inspired by ideas from computer vision, thus
learning models that are more robust. Empirical evaluation over a range of
sentiment datasets with a convolutional neural network shows that, compared to
a baseline model and the dropout method, our method achieves superior
performance over noisy inputs and out-of-domain data.

 <dc:description>  Decision making in uncertain and risky environments is a prominent area of
research. Standard economic theories fail to fully explain human behaviour,
while a potentially promising alternative may lie in the direction of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) theory. We analyse data for 46 players extracted
from a financial market online game and test whether Reinforcement Learning
(Q-Learning) could capture these players behaviour using a risk measure based
on financial modeling. Moreover we test an earlier hypothesis that players are
&quot;na\&quot;ive&quot; (short-sighted). Our results indicate that a simple Reinforcement
Learning model which considers only the selling component of the task captures
the decision-making process for a subset of players but this is not sufficient
to draw any conclusion on the population. We also find that there is not a
significant improvement of fitting of the players when using a full RL model
against a myopic version, where only immediate reward is valued by the players.
This indicates that players, if using a Reinforcement Learning approach, do so
na\&quot;ively

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to propose distributed strategies for adaptive
learning of signals defined over graphs. Assuming the graph signal to be
bandlimited, the method enables distributed reconstruction, with guaranteed
performance in terms of mean-square error, and tracking from a limited number
of sampled observations taken from a subset of vertices. A detailed mean square
analysis is carried out and illustrates the role played by the sampling
strategy on the performance of the proposed method. Finally, some useful
strategies for distributed selection of the sampling set are provided. Several
numerical results validate our theoretical findings, and illustrate the
performance of the proposed method for distributed adaptive learning of signals
defined over graphs.

 <dc:description>  Video resolutions used in variety of media are constantly rising. While
manufacturers struggle to perfect their screens it is also important to ensure
high quality of displayed image. Overall quality can be measured using Mean
Opinion Score (MOS). Video quality can be affected by miscellaneous artifacts,
appearing at every stage of video creation and transmission. In this paper, we
present a solution to calculate four distinct video quality metrics that can be
applied to a real time video quality assessment system. Our assessment module
is capable of processing 8K resolution in real time set at the level of 30
frames per second. Throughput of 2.19 GB/s surpasses performance of pure
software solutions. To concentrate on architectural optimization, the module
was created using high level language.

 <dc:description>  A vertex ranking of a graph is an assignment of ranks (or colors) to the
vertices of the graph, in such a way that any simple path connecting two
vertices of equal rank, must contain a vertex of a higher rank. In this paper
we study a relaxation of this notion, in which the requirement above should
only hold for paths of some bounded length $l$ for some fixed $l$. For
instance, already the case $l=2$ exhibit quite a different behavior than proper
coloring. We prove upper and lower bounds on the minimum number of ranks
required for several graph families, such as trees, planar graphs, graphs
excluding a fixed minor and degenerate graphs.

 <dc:description>  Tracking-by-detection methods have demonstrated competitive performance in
recent years. In these approaches, the tracking model heavily relies on the
quality of the training set. Due to the limited amount of labeled training
data, additional samples need to be extracted and labeled by the tracker
itself. This often leads to the inclusion of corrupted training samples, due to
occlusions, misalignments and other perturbations. Existing
tracking-by-detection methods either ignore this problem, or employ a separate
component for managing the training set.
  We propose a novel generic approach for alleviating the problem of corrupted
training samples in tracking-by-detection frameworks. Our approach dynamically
manages the training set by estimating the quality of the samples. Contrary to
existing approaches, we propose a unified formulation by minimizing a single
loss over both the target appearance model and the sample quality weights. The
joint formulation enables corrupted samples to be down-weighted while
increasing the impact of correct ones. Experiments are performed on three
benchmarks: OTB-2015 with 100 videos, VOT-2015 with 60 videos, and Temple-Color
with 128 videos. On the OTB-2015, our unified formulation significantly
improves the baseline, with a gain of 3.8% in mean overlap precision. Finally,
our method achieves state-of-the-art results on all three datasets. Code and
supplementary material are available at

 <dc:title>FastBDT: A speed-optimized and cache-friendly implementation of
  stochastic gradient-boosted decision trees for multivariate classification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Keck, Thomas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Stochastic gradient-boosted decision trees are widely employed for
multivariate classification and regression tasks. This paper presents a
speed-optimized and cache-friendly implementation for multivariate
classification called FastBDT. FastBDT is one order of magnitude faster during
the fitting-phase and application-phase, in comparison with popular
implementations in software frameworks like TMVA, scikit-learn and XGBoost. The
concepts used to optimize the execution time and performance studies are
discussed in detail in this paper. The key ideas include: An equal-frequency
binning on the input data, which allows replacing expensive floating-point with
integer operations, while at the same time increasing the quality of the
classification; a cache-friendly linear access pattern to the input data, in
contrast to usual implementations, which exhibit a random access pattern.
FastBDT provides interfaces to C/C++, Python and TMVA. It is extensively used
in the field of high energy physics by the Belle II experiment.

 <dc:title>The Complexity of Flat Freeze LTL</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the model-checking problem for freeze LTL on one-counter automata
(OCAs). Freeze LTL extends LTL with the freeze quantifier, which allows one to
store different counter values of a run in registers so that they can be
compared with one another. As the model-checking problem is undecidable in
general, we focus on the flat fragment of freeze LTL, in which the usage of the
freeze quantifier is restricted. Recently, Lechner et al. showed that model
checking for flat freeze LTL on OCAs with binary encoding of counter updates is
decidable and in 2NEXPTIME. In this paper, we prove that the problem is, in
fact, NEXPTIME-complete no matter whether counter updates are encoded in unary
or binary. Like Lechner et al., we rely on a reduction to the reachability
problem in OCAs with parameterized tests (OCAPs). The new aspect is that we
simulate OCAPs by alternating two-way automata over words. This implies an
exponential upper bound on the parameter values that we exploit towards an NP
algorithm for reachability in OCAPs with unary updates. We obtain our main
result as a corollary.

 <dc:description>  Due to its wide use in personal, but most importantly, professional contexts,
email represents a valuable source of information that can be harvested for
understanding, reengineering and repurposing undocumented business processes of
companies and institutions. Towards this aim, a few researchers investigated
the problem of extracting process oriented information from email logs in order
to take benefit of the many available process mining techniques and tools. In
this paper we go further in this direction, by proposing a new method for
mining process models from email logs that leverage unsupervised machine
learning techniques with little human involvement. Moreover, our method allows
to semi-automatically label emails with activity names, that can be used for
activity recognition in new incoming emails. A use case demonstrates the
usefulness of the proposed solution using a modest in size, yet real-world,
dataset containing emails that belong to two different process models.

 <dc:description>  Accurate scale estimation of a target is a challenging research problem in
visual object tracking. Most state-of-the-art methods employ an exhaustive
scale search to estimate the target size. The exhaustive search strategy is
computationally expensive and struggles when encountered with large scale
variations. This paper investigates the problem of accurate and robust scale
estimation in a tracking-by-detection framework. We propose a novel scale
adaptive tracking approach by learning separate discriminative correlation
filters for translation and scale estimation. The explicit scale filter is
learned online using the target appearance sampled at a set of different
scales. Contrary to standard approaches, our method directly learns the
appearance change induced by variations in the target scale. Additionally, we
investigate strategies to reduce the computational cost of our approach.
  Extensive experiments are performed on the OTB and the VOT2014 datasets.
Compared to the standard exhaustive scale search, our approach achieves a gain
of 2.5% in average overlap precision on the OTB dataset. Additionally, our
method is computationally efficient, operating at a 50% higher frame rate
compared to the exhaustive scale search. Our method obtains the top rank in
performance by outperforming 19 state-of-the-art trackers on OTB and 37
state-of-the-art trackers on VOT2014.

 <dc:title>Uncertainty Analysis of Simple Macroeconomic Models Using Angel-Daemon

 <dc:description>  We propose the use of an angel-daemon framework to perform an uncertainty
analysis of short-term macroeconomic models with exogenous components. An
uncertainty profile $\mathcal U$ is a short and macroscopic description of a
potentially perturbed situation. The angel-daemon framework uses $\mathcal U$
to define a strategic game where two agents, the angel and the daemon, act
selfishly having different goals. The Nash equilibria of those games provide
the stable strategies in perturbed situations, giving a natural estimation of
uncertainty.
  In this initial work we apply the framework in order to get an uncertainty
analysis of linear versions of the IS-LM and the IS-MP models. In those models,
by considering uncertainty profiles, we can capture different economical
situations. Some of them can be described in terms of macroeconomic policy
coordination. In other cases we just analyse the results of the system under
some possible perturbation level. Besides providing examples of application we
analyse the structure of the Nash equilibria in some particular cases of

 <dc:title>Derandomized concentration bounds for polynomials, and hypergraph
  maximal independent set</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Harris, David G.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A parallel algorithm for maximal independent set (MIS) in hypergraphs has
been a long-standing algorithmic challenge, dating back nearly 30 years to a
survey of Karp &amp; Ramachandran (1990). Despite its apparent simplicity, there
have been no general sub-polynomial-time algorithms or hardness reductions. The
best randomized parallel algorithm for hypergraphs of fixed rank $r$ was
developed by Beame &amp; Luby (1990) and Kelsen (1992), running in time roughly
$(\log n)^{r!}$. The key probabilistic tool underlying this algorithm is a
concentration bound for low-degree polynomials applied to independent input
variables; this is a natural generalization of concentration bounds for sums of
independent random variables, which are ubiquitous in combinatorics and
computer science.
  These concentration bounds for polynomials do not lend themselves to standard
derandomization techniques. Thus, the algorithm of Kelsen cannot be
derandomized in any known way. There are no deterministic parallel algorithms
for hypergraph MIS for any fixed rank $r &gt; 3$.
  We improve the randomized algorithm of Kelsen to obtain a running time of
$(\log n)^{2^r}$. We also give a method for derandomizing concentration bounds
for polynomials, thus obtaining a deterministic algorithm running in $(\log
n)^{2^{r+3}}$ time and $(mn)^{O(1)}$ processors. Our analysis can also apply
when $r$ is slowly growing; using this in conjunction with a strategy of Bercea
et al. (2015) gives a deterministic MIS algorithm running in time $\exp(O(
\frac{\log m}{\log \log m} + \log \log n)$.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the classical problem of exploring a ring by a cohort
of synchronous robots. We focus on the perpetual version of this problem in
which it is required that each node of the ring is visited by a robot
infinitely often. The challenge in this paper is twofold. First, we assume that
the robots evolve in a highly dynamic ring, \ie edges may appear and disappear
unpredictably without any recurrence, periodicity, nor stability assumption.
The only assumption we made (known as temporal connectivity assumption) is that
each node is infinitely often reachable from any other node. Second, we aim at
providing a self-stabilizing algorithm to the robots, i.e., the algorithm must
guarantee an eventual correct behavior regardless of the initial state and
positions of the robots.In this harsh environment, our contribution is to fully
characterize, for each size of the ring, the necessary and sufficient number of
robots to solve deterministically the problem.

 <dc:description>  This work deals with the computation of industry-relevant bond wire failure
probabilities in microelectronic packages. Under operating conditions, a
package is subject to Joule heating that can lead to electrothermally induced
failures. Manufacturing tolerances result, e.g., in uncertain bond wire
geometries that often induce very small failure probabilities requiring a high
number of Monte Carlo (MC) samples to be computed. Therefore, a hybrid MC
sampling scheme that combines the use of an expensive computer model with a
cheap surrogate is used. The fraction of surrogate evaluations is maximized
using an iterative procedure, yielding accurate results at reduced cost.
Moreover, the scheme is non-intrusive, i.e., existing code can be reused. The
algorithm is used to compute the failure probability for an example package and
the computational savings are assessed by performing a surrogate efficiency
study.

 <dc:title>Transfer Learning for Material Classification using Convolutional
  Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wieschollek, Patrick</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Material classification in natural settings is a challenge due to complex
interplay of geometry, reflectance properties, and illumination. Previous work
on material classification relies strongly on hand-engineered features of
visual samples. In this work we use a Convolutional Neural Network (convnet)
that learns descriptive features for the specific task of material recognition.
Specifically, transfer learning from the task of object recognition is
exploited to more effectively train good features for material classification.
The approach of transfer learning using convnets yields significantly higher
recognition rates when compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. We
then analyze the relative contribution of reflectance and shading information
by a decomposition of the image into its intrinsic components. The use of
convnets for material classification was hindered by the strong demand for
sufficient and diverse training data, even with transfer learning approaches.
Therefore, we present a new data set containing approximately 10k images
divided into 10 material categories.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel hands-free method to interactively segment 3D medical
volumes. In our scenario, a human user progressively segments an organ by
answering a series of questions of the form &quot;Is this voxel inside the object to
segment?&quot;. At each iteration, the chosen question is defined as the one halving
a set of candidate segmentations given the answered questions. For a quick and
efficient exploration, these segmentations are sampled according to the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Our sampling technique relies on a combination
of relaxed shape prior, learnt probability map and consistency with previous
answers. We demonstrate the potential of our strategy on a prostate
segmentation MRI dataset. Through the study of failure cases with synthetic
examples, we demonstrate the adaptation potential of our method. We also show
that our method outperforms two intuitive baselines: one based on random
questions, the other one being the thresholded probability map.

 <dc:description>  This paper analyzes stability conditions for wholesale electricity markets
under real-time retail pricing and realistic consumption models with memory,
which explicitly take into account previous electricity prices and consumption
levels. By passing on the current retail price of electricity from supplier to
consumer and feeding the observed consumption back to the supplier, a
closed-loop dynamical system for electricity prices and consumption arises
whose stability is to be investigated. Under mild assumptions on the generation
cost of electricity and consumers' backlog disutility functions, we show that,
for consumer models with price memory only, market stability is achieved if the
ratio between the consumers' marginal backlog disutility and the suppliers'
marginal cost of supply remains below a fixed threshold. Further, consumer
models with price and consumption memory can result in greater stability
regions and faster convergence to the equilibrium compared to models with price
memory alone, if consumption deviations from nominal demand are adequately
penalized.

 <dc:description>  In live and studio recordings unexpected sound events often lead to
interferences in the signal. For non-stationary interferences, sound source
separation techniques can be used to reduce the interference level in the
recording. In this context, we present a novel approach combining the strengths
of two algorithmic families: NMF and KAM. The recent KAM approach applies
robust statistics on frames selected by a source-specific kernel to perform
source separation. Based on semi-supervised NMF, we extend this approach in two
ways. First, we locate the interference in the recording based on detected NMF
activity. Second, we improve the kernel-based frame selection by incorporating
an NMF-based estimate of the clean music signal. Further, we introduce a
temporal context in the kernel, taking some musical structure into account. Our
experiments show improved separation quality for our proposed method over a
state-of-the-art approach for interference reduction.

 <dc:description>  An optimal data partitioning in parallel &amp; distributed implementation of
clustering algorithms is a necessary computation as it ensures independent task
completion, fair distribution, less number of affected points and better &amp;
faster merging. Though partitioning using Kd Tree is being conventionally used
in academia, it suffers from performance drenches and bias (non equal
distribution) as dimensionality of data increases and hence is not suitable for
practical use in industry where dimensionality can be of order of 100s to
1000s. To address these issues we propose two new partitioning techniques using
existing mathematical models &amp; study their feasibility, performance (bias and
partitioning speed) &amp; possible variants in choosing initial seeds. First method
uses an n dimensional hashed grid based approach which is based on mapping the
points in space to a set of cubes which hashes the points. Second method uses a
tree of voronoi planes where each plane corresponds to a partition. We found
that grid based approach was computationally impractical, while using a tree of
voronoi planes (using scalable K-Means++ initial seeds) drastically
outperformed the Kd-tree tree method as dimensionality increased.

 <dc:title>Selection of Input Primitives for the Generalized Label Correcting

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The generalized label correcting method is an efficient search-based approach
to trajectory optimization. It relies on a finite set of control primitives
that are concatenated into candidate control signals. This paper investigates
the principled selection of this set of control primitives. Emphasis is placed
on a particularly challenging input space geometry, the $n$-dimensional sphere.
We propose using controls which minimize a generalized energy function and
discuss the optimization technique used to obtain these control primitives. A
numerical experiment is presented showing a factor of two improvement in
running time when using the optimized control primitives over a random sampling
strategy.

 <dc:title>Separability of Lyapunov Functions for Contractive Monotone Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Coogan, Samuel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider constructing Lyapunov functions for systems that are both
monotone and contractive with respect to a weighted one norm or infinity norm.
This class of systems admits separable Lyapunov functions that are either the
sum or the maximum of a collection of functions of a single argument. In either
case, two classes of separable Lyapunov functions exist: the first class is
separable along the system's state, and the second class is separable along
components of the system's vector field. The latter case is advantageous for
many practically motivated systems for which it is difficult to measure the
system's state but easier to measure the system's velocity or rate of change.
We provide several examples to demonstrate our results.

 <dc:title>GAdaBoost: Accelerating Adaboost Feature Selection with Genetic
  Algorithms</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Boosted cascade of simple features, by Viola and Jones, is one of the most
famous object detection frameworks. However, it suffers from a lengthy training
process. This is due to the vast features space and the exhaustive search
nature of Adaboost. In this paper we propose GAdaboost: a Genetic Algorithm to
accelerate the training procedure through natural feature selection.
Specifically, we propose to limit Adaboost search within a subset of the huge
feature space, while evolving this subset following a Genetic Algorithm.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed GAdaboost is up to 3.7 times faster
than Adaboost. We also demonstrate that the price of this speedup is a mere
decrease (3%, 4%) in detection accuracy when tested on FDDB benchmark face
detection set, and Caltech Web Faces respectively.

 <dc:description>  Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is one of the promising radio access
techniques for performance enhancement in next-generation cellular
communications. Compared to orthogonal frequency division multiple access
(OFDMA), which is a well-known high-capacity orthogonal multiple access (OMA)
technique, NOMA offers a set of desirable benefits, including greater spectrum
efficiency. There are different types of NOMA techniques, including
power-domain and code-domain. This paper primarily focuses on power-domain NOMA
that utilizes superposition coding (SC) at the transmitter and successive
interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver. Various researchers have
demonstrated that NOMA can be used effectively to meet both network-level and
user-experienced data rate requirements of fifth-generation (5G) technologies.
From that perspective, this paper comprehensively surveys the recent progress
of NOMA in 5G systems, reviewing the state-of-the-art capacity analysis, power
allocation strategies, user fairness, and user-pairing schemes in NOMA. In
addition, this paper discusses how NOMA performs when it is integrated with
various proven wireless communications techniques, such as cooperative
communications, multiple input multiple output (MIMO), beamforming, space time
coding, and network coding, among others. Furthermore, this paper discusses
several important issues on NOMA implementation and provides some avenues for
future research.

 <dc:description>  Entity Resolution, also called record linkage or deduplication, refers to the
process of identifying and merging duplicate versions of the same entity into a
unified representation. The standard practice is to use a Rule based or Machine
Learning based model that compares entity pairs and assigns a score to
represent the pairs' Match/Non-Match status. However, performing an exhaustive
pair-wise comparison on all pairs of records leads to quadratic matcher
complexity and hence a Blocking step is performed before the Matching to group
similar entities into smaller blocks that the matcher can then examine
exhaustively. Several blocking schemes have been developed to efficiently and
effectively block the input dataset into manageable groups. At CareerBuilder
(CB), we perform deduplication on massive datasets of people profiles collected
from disparate sources with varying informational content. We observed that,
employing a single blocking technique did not cover the base for all possible
scenarios due to the multi-faceted nature of our data sources. In this paper,
we describe our ensemble approach to blocking that combines two different
blocking techniques to leverage their respective strengths.

 <dc:title>Semantic Similarity Strategies for Job Title Classification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Automatic and accurate classification of items enables numerous downstream
applications in many domains. These applications can range from faceted
browsing of items to product recommendations and big data analytics. In the
online recruitment domain, we refer to classifying job ads to pre-defined or
custom occupation categories as job title classification. A large-scale job
title classification system can power various downstream applications such as
semantic search, job recommendations and labor market analytics. In this paper,
we discuss experiments conducted to improve our in-house job title
classification system. The classification component of the system is composed
of a two-stage coarse and fine level classifier cascade that classifies input
text such as job title and/or job ads to one of the thousands of job titles in
our taxonomy. To improve classification accuracy and effectiveness, we
experiment with various semantic representation strategies such as average W2V
vectors and document similarity measures such as Word Movers Distance (WMD).
Our initial results show an overall improvement in accuracy of Carotene[1].

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In view of the importance of quantum non-locality in cryptography, quantum
computation and communication complexity, it is crucial to decide whether a
given correlation exhibits non-locality or not. In the light of a theorem by
Pitowski, it is generally believed that this problem is computationally
intractable. In this paper, we first prove that the Euclidean distance of given
correlations from the local polytope can be computed in polynomial time with
arbitrary fixed error, granted the access to a certain oracle. Namely, given a
fixed error, we derive two upper bounds on the running time. The first bound is
linear in the number of measurements. The second bound scales as the number of
measurements to the sixth power. The former is dominant only for a very high
number of measurements and is never saturated in the performed numerical tests.
We then introduce a simple algorithm for simulating the oracle. In all the
considered numerical tests, the simulation of the oracle contributes with a
multiplicative factor to the overall running time and, thus, does not affect
the sixth-power law of the oracle-assisted algorithm.

 <dc:description>  The emerging paradigm of Information-Centric Networking is an exciting field
of research, opening opportunities in many areas, such as forwarding
strategies, caching placement policies, applications (e.g. video streaming and
instant messaging), to name a few. In this paper, we address the mobility
aspect of ICN, as well as how it performs in tactical wireless ad hoc
environments. In this paper, we present results from a simulation study that
investigates the performance of Named Data Networking, an instantiation of ICN,
in such environments. We perform a series of simulations based on ndnSIM
studying different mobility scenarios. Our simulations show that even in the
short-term absence of the producer, consumers can still achieve better file
retrieval when caches are used. As an effort to increase the cache diversity
and have a better utilization of the Content Store we study probabilistic LRU.
Furthermore, we compare the performance of our NDN network with a TCP based
approach, using OLSR routing protocol, discussing advantages and disadvantages
of each approach.

 <dc:description>  How does one obtain an admissible heuristic for a kinodynamic motion planning
problem? This paper develops the analytical tools and techniques to answer this
question. A sufficient condition for the admissibility of a heuristic is
presented which can be checked directly from the problem data. This condition
is also used to formulate a concave program to optimize an admissible
heuristic. This optimization is then approximated and solved in polynomial time
using sum-of-squares programming techniques. A number of examples are provided
to demonstrate these concepts.

 <dc:description>  A novel scheme for non-volatile digital computation is proposed using
spin-transfer torque (STT) and automotion of magnetic domain walls (DWs). The
basic computing element is composed of a lateral spin valve (SV) with two
ferromagnetic (FM) wires served as interconnects, where DW automotion is used
to propagate the information from one device to another. The non-reciprocity of
both device and interconnect is realized by sizing different contact areas at
the input and the output as well as enhancing the local damping mechanism. The
proposed logic is suitable for scaling due to a high energy barrier provided by
a long FM wire. Compared to the scheme based on non-local spin valves (NLSVs)
in the previous proposal, the devices can be operated at lower current density
due to utilizing all injected spins for local magnetization reversals, and thus
improve both energy efficiency and resistance to electromigration. This device
concept is justified by simulating a buffer, an inverter, and a 3-input
majority gate with comprehensive numerical simulations, including spin
transport through the FM/non-magnetic (NM) interfaces as well as the NM channel
and stochastic magnetization dynamics inside FM wires. In addition to digital
computing, the proposed framework can also be used as a transducer between DWs
and spin currents for higher wiring flexibility in the interconnect network.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the problem of controlling a two-dimensional robotic
swarm with the purpose of achieving high level and complex spatio-temporal
patterns. We use a rich spatio-temporal logic that is capable of describing a
wide range of time varying and complex spatial configurations, and develop a
method to encode such formal specifications as a set of mixed integer linear
constraints, which are incorporated into a mixed integer linear programming
problem. We plan trajectories for each individual robot such that the whole
swarm satisfies the spatio-temporal requirements, while optimizing total robot
movement and/or a metric that shows how strongly the swarm trajectory resembles
given spatio-temporal behaviors. An illustrative case study is included.

 <dc:description>  We study linear time model checking of collapsible higher-order pushdown
systems (CPDS) of order 2 (manipulating stack of stacks) against MSO and PDL
(propositional dynamic logic with converse and loop) enhanced with push/pop
matching relations. To capture these linear time behaviours with matchings, we
propose order-2 nested words. These graphs consist of a word structure
augmented with two binary matching relations, one for each order of stack,
which relate a push with matching pops (or collapse) on the respective stack.
Due to the matching relations, satisfiability and model checking are
undecidable. Hence we propose an under-approximation, bounding the number of
times an order-1 push can be popped. With this under-approximation, which still
allows unbounded stack height, we get decidability for satisfiability and model
checking of both MSO and PDL. The problems are ExpTime-Complete for PDL.

 <dc:description>  The metric sketching problem is defined as follows. Given a metric on $n$
points, and $\epsilon&gt;0$, we wish to produce a small size data structure
(sketch) that, given any pair of point indices, recovers the distance between
the points up to a $1+\epsilon$ distortion. In this paper we consider metrics
induced by $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$ norms whose spread (the ratio of the diameter
to the closest pair distance) is bounded by $\Phi&gt;0$. A well-known
dimensionality reduction theorem due to Johnson and Lindenstrauss yields a
sketch of size $O(\epsilon^{-2} \log (\Phi n) n\log n)$, i.e., $O(\epsilon^{-2}
\log (\Phi n) \log n)$ bits per point. We show that this bound is not optimal,
and can be substantially improved to $O(\epsilon^{-2}\log(1/\epsilon) \cdot
\log n + \log\log \Phi)$ bits per point. Furthermore, we show that our bound is
tight up to a factor of $\log(1/\epsilon)$.
  We also consider sketching of general metrics and provide a sketch of size
$O(n\log(1/\epsilon)+ \log\log \Phi)$ bits per point, which we show is optimal.

 <dc:description>  In this dissertation, we present for each natural number $k$, semantic
characterizations of the $\exists^k \forall^*$ and $\forall^k \exists^*$ prefix
classes of first order logic sentences, over all structures finite and
infinite. This result, that we call the *generalized {\L}o\'s-Tarski theorem*,
abbreviated $\mathsf{GLT}(k)$, yields the classical {\L}o\'s-Tarski
preservation theorem when $k$ equals 0. It also provides new characterizations
of the $\Sigma^0_2$ and $\Pi^0_2$ prefix classes, that are finer than all
characterizations of these classes in the literature. Further, our semantic
notions are finitary in nature, in contrast to those contained in the
literature characterizations.
  In the context of finite structures, we formulate an abstract combinatorial
property of structures, that when satisfied by a class, ensures that
$\mathsf{GLT}(k)$ holds over the class. This property, that we call the
*Equivalent Bounded Substructure Property*, abbreviated $\mathsf{EBSP}$,
intuitively states that a large structure contains a small &quot;logically similar&quot;
substructure. It turns out that this simply stated property is enjoyed by a
variety of classes of interest in computer science: examples include words,
trees (unordered, ordered or ranked), nested words, graph classes of bounded
tree-depth/shrub-depth, and $m$-partite cographs. Further, $\mathsf{EBSP}$
remains preserved under various well-studied operations, such as
complementation, transpose, the line-graph operation, disjoint union, cartesian
and tensor products, etc. This enables constructing a wide spectrum of classes
that satisfy $\mathsf{EBSP}$, and hence $\mathsf{GLT}(k)$. Remarkably,
$\mathsf{EBSP}$ can be regarded as a finitary analogue of the classical
downward L\&quot;owenheim-Skolem property.
  In summary, this dissertation provides new notions and results in both
contexts, that of all structures and that of finite structures.

 <dc:title>Color-Based Coding Unit Level Adaptive Quantization for HEVC</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Prangnell, Lee</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sanchez, Victor</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  HEVC HM 16 includes a Coding Unit (CU) level perceptual quantization
technique named AdaptiveQP. AdaptiveQP adjusts the Quantization Parameter (QP)
at the CU level based on the spatial activity of samples in the four
constituent NxN sub-blocks of the luma Coding Block (CB), which is contained
within a 2Nx2N CU. In this paper, we propose C-BAQ, which, in contrast to
AdaptiveQP, adjusts the CU level QP according to the spatial activity of
samples in the four constituent NxN sub-blocks of both the luma and chroma CBs.
By computing the sum of luma, chroma Cb and chroma Cr spatial activity in a CU,
a richer reflection of spatial activity in the CU is attained. Therefore, a
more appropriate CU level QP can be selected, thus leading to important
improvements in terms of coding efficiency. We evaluate the proposed technique
in HEVC HM 16.7 using 4:4:4, 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 YCbCr sequences. Both subjective
and objective evaluations are undertaken during which we compare C-BAQ with
AdaptiveQP. The objective evaluation reveals that C-BAQ attains a maximum
BD-Rate reduction of 15.9% (Y), 13.1% (Cr) and 16.1% (Cb) in addition to a
maximum decoding time reduction of 11.0%.

 <dc:title>Automated Visual Fin Identification of Individual Great White Sharks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper discusses the automated visual identification of individual great
white sharks from dorsal fin imagery. We propose a computer vision photo ID
system and report recognition results over a database of thousands of
unconstrained fin images. To the best of our knowledge this line of work
establishes the first fully automated contour-based visual ID system in the
field of animal biometrics. The approach put forward appreciates shark fins as
textureless, flexible and partially occluded objects with an individually
characteristic shape. In order to recover animal identities from an image we
first introduce an open contour stroke model, which extends multi-scale region
segmentation to achieve robust fin detection. Secondly, we show that
combinatorial, scale-space selective fingerprinting can successfully encode fin
individuality. We then measure the species-specific distribution of visual
individuality along the fin contour via an embedding into a global `fin space'.
Exploiting this domain, we finally propose a non-linear model for individual
animal recognition and combine all approaches into a fine-grained
multi-instance framework. We provide a system evaluation, compare results to
prior work, and report performance and properties in detail.

 <dc:description>  The increased availability of interactive maps on the Internet and on
personal mobile devices has created new challenges in computational cartography
and, in particular, for label placement in maps. Operations like rotation,
zoom, and translation dynamically change the map over time and make a
consistent adaptation of the map labeling necessary.
  In this paper, we consider map labeling for the case that a map undergoes a
sequence of operations over a specified time span. We unify and generalize
several preceding models for dynamic map labeling into one versatile and
flexible model. In contrast to previous research, we completely abstract from
the particular operations (e.g., zoom, rotation, etc.) and express the labeling
problem as a set of time intervals representing the labels' presences,
activities, and conflicts. The model's strength is manifested in its simplicity
and broad range of applications. In particular, it supports label selection
both for map features with fixed position as well as for moving entities (e.g.,
for tracking vehicles in logistics or air traffic control).
  Through extensive experiments on OpenStreetMap data, we evaluate our model
using algorithms of varying complexity as a case study for navigation systems.
Our experiments show that even simple (and thus, fast) algorithms achieve
near-optimal solutions in our model with respect to an intuitive objective
function.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider two sequential decision making problems with a
convexity structure, namely an energy storage optimization task and a
multi-product assembly example. We formulate these problems in the stochastic
programming framework and discuss an approximate dynamic programming technique
for their solutions. As the cost-to-go functions are convex in these cases, we
use max-affine estimates for their approximations. To train such a max-affine
estimate, we provide a new convex regression algorithm, and evaluate it
empirically for these planning scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Gene expression is a readily-observed quantification of transcriptional
activity and cellular state that enables the recovery of the relationships
between regulators and their target genes. Reconstructing transcriptional
regulatory networks from gene expression data is a problem that has attracted
much attention, but previous work often makes the simplifying (but unrealistic)
assumption that regulator activity is represented by mRNA levels. We use a
latent tree graphical model to analyze gene expression without relying on
transcription factor expression as a proxy for regulator activity. The latent
tree model is a type of Markov random field that includes both observed gene
variables and latent (hidden) variables, which factorize on a Markov tree.
Through efficient unsupervised learning approaches, we determine which groups
of genes are co-regulated by hidden regulators and the activity levels of those
regulators. Post-processing annotates many of these discovered latent variables
as specific transcription factors or groups of transcription factors. Other
latent variables do not necessarily represent physical regulators but instead
reveal hidden structure in the gene expression such as shared biological
function. We apply the latent tree graphical model to a yeast stress response
dataset. In addition to novel predictions, such as condition-specific binding
of the transcription factor Msn4, our model recovers many known aspects of the
yeast regulatory network. These include groups of co-regulated genes,
condition-specific regulator activity, and combinatorial regulation among
transcription factors. The latent tree graphical model is a general approach
for analyzing gene expression data that requires no prior knowledge of which
possible regulators exist, regulator activity, or where transcription factors
physically bind.

 <dc:title>Markov Random Field Model-Based Salt and Pepper Noise Removal</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Baghaie, Ahmadreza</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Problem of impulse noise reduction is a very well studied problem in image
processing community and many different approaches have been proposed to tackle
this problem. In the current work, the problem of fixed value impulse noise
(salt and pepper) removal from images is investigated by use of a Markov Random
Field (MRF) models with smoothness priors. After the formulation of the problem
as an inpainting problem, graph cuts with $\alpha$-expansion moves are
considered for minimization of the energy functional. As for comparisons,
several other minimization techniques that are widely used for MRF models'
optimization are considered and the results are compared using
Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) as
metrics. The investigations show the superiority of graph cuts with
$\alpha$-expansion moves over the other techniques both in terms of PSNR and
also computational times.

 <dc:description>  Through the continued progress and advances of networking technology and also
through efforts like Industry 4.0, SmartGrid, SmartCities, systems, that have
been self-sustaining for the most part are now forming networked Cyber-physical
Systems (CPS). Networking does not only have undoubtely benefits but also
increase the often overlooked attack surface of these systems. A basic problem
in information technology systems is building and sustaining trust. This work
looks at the usage of reputation systems in the field of CPS and whether they
could be used to assert the trustworthyness of communication partners. This is
done in context of a research project inHMotion of the University of applied
Sciences Munich, which is in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS). A risk based analysis is performed for this project. Based on solicited
threats mitigations are proposed. A possible solution might be the usage of a
reputation system, which is designed and a prototype implementation for a
simulation ist done. The concept of a meta reputation system, which combines
different reputation systems and verification systems can achieve promising
results in a simple simulation. In a concluding discussion criticism and
possible improvements are given.

 <dc:description>  The $K$-receiver degraded broadcast channel with secrecy outside a bounded
range is studied, in which a transmitter sends $K$ messages to $K$ receivers,
and the channel quality gradually degrades from receiver $K$ to receiver 1.
Each receiver $k$ is required to decode message $W_1,\ldots,W_k$, for $1\leq
k\leq K$, and to be kept ignorant of $W_{k+2},\ldots,W_K$, for $k=1,\ldots,
K-2$. Thus, each message $W_k$ is kept secure from receivers with at least
two-level worse channel quality, i.e., receivers 1, $\ldots$, $k-2$. The
secrecy capacity region is fully characterized. The achievable scheme
designates one superposition layer to each message with binning employed for
each layer. Joint embedded coding and binning are employed to protect all
upper-layer messages from lower-layer receivers. Furthermore, the scheme allows
adjacent layers to share rates so that part of the rate of each message can be
shared with its immediate upper-layer message to enlarge the rate region. More
importantly, an induction approach is developed to perform Fourier-Motzkin
elimination of $2K$ variables from the order of $K^2$ bounds to obtain a
close-form achievable rate region. An outer bound is developed that matches the
achievable rate region, whose proof involves recursive construction of the rate
bounds and exploits the intuition gained from the achievable scheme.

 <dc:description>  The ability to automatically recognize a person's behavioral context can
contribute to health monitoring, aging care and many other domains. Validating
context recognition in-the-wild is crucial to promote practical applications
that work in real-life settings. We collected over 300k minutes of sensor data
with context labels from 60 subjects. Unlike previous studies, our subjects
used their own personal phone, in any way that was convenient to them, and
engaged in their routine in their natural environments. Unscripted behavior and
unconstrained phone usage resulted in situations that are harder to recognize.
We demonstrate how fusion of multi-modal sensors is important for resolving
such cases. We present a baseline system, and encourage researchers to use our
public dataset to compare methods and improve context recognition in-the-wild.

 <dc:description>  Locally decodable codes (LDCs) are error correcting codes that allow for
decoding of a single message bit using a small number of queries to a corrupted
encoding. Despite decades of study, the optimal trade-off between query
complexity and codeword length is far from understood. In this work, we give a
new characterization of LDCs using distributions over Boolean functions whose
expectation is hard to approximate (in~$L_\infty$~norm) with a small number of
samples. We coin the term `outlaw distributions' for such distributions since
they `defy' the Law of Large Numbers. We show that the existence of outlaw
distributions over sufficiently `smooth' functions implies the existence of
constant query LDCs and vice versa. We give several candidates for outlaw
distributions over smooth functions coming from finite field incidence
geometry, additive combinatorics and from hypergraph (non)expanders.
  We also prove a useful lemma showing that (smooth) LDCs which are only
required to work on average over a random message and a random message index
can be turned into true LDCs at the cost of only constant factors in the
parameters.

 <dc:description>  Many real-world systems are composed of interdependent networks that rely on
one another. Such networks are typically designed and operated by different
entities, who aim at maximizing their own payoffs. There exists a game among
these entities when designing their own networks. In this paper, we study the
game investigating how the rational behaviors of entities impact the system
robustness. We first introduce a mathematical model to quantify the interacting
payoffs among varying entities. Then we study the Nash equilibrium of the game
and compare it with the optimal social welfare. We reveal that the cooperation
among different entities can be reached to maximize the social welfare in
continuous game only when the average degree of each network is constant.
Therefore, the huge gap between Nash equilibrium and optimal social welfare
generally exists. The rationality of entities makes the system inherently
deficient and even renders it extremely vulnerable in some cases. We analyze
our model for two concrete systems with continuous strategy space and discrete
strategy space, respectively. Furthermore, we uncover some factors (such as
weakening coupled strength of interdependent networks, designing suitable
topology dependency of the system) that help reduce the gap and the system
vulnerability.

 <dc:description>  Privacy-preserving average consensus aims to guarantee the privacy of initial
states and asymptotic consensus on the exact average of the initial value. In
existing work, it is achieved by adding and subtracting variance decaying and
zero-sum random noises to the consensus process. However, there is lack of
theoretical analysis to quantify the degree of the privacy protection. In this
paper, we introduce the maximum disclosure probability that the other nodes can
infer one node's initial state within a given small interval to quantify the
privacy. We develop a novel privacy definition, named $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-data-privacy, to depict the relationship between maximum disclosure
probability and estimation accuracy. Then, we prove that the general
privacy-preserving average consensus (GPAC) provides $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-data-privacy, and provide the closed-form expression of the
relationship between $\epsilon$ and $\delta$. Meanwhile, it is shown that the
added noise with uniform distribution is optimal in terms of achieving the
highest $(\epsilon, \delta)$-data-privacy. We also prove that when all
information used in the consensus process is available, the privacy will be
compromised. Finally, an optimal privacy-preserving average consensus (OPAC)
algorithm is proposed to achieve the highest $(\epsilon, \delta)$-data-privacy
and avoid the privacy compromission. Simulations are conducted to verify the
results.

 <dc:description>  The robust estimator presented in this paper processes each structure
independently. The scales of the structures are estimated adaptively and no
threshold is involved in spite of different objective functions. The user has
to specify only the number of elemental subsets for random sampling. After
classifying all the input data, the segmented structures are sorted by their
strengths and the strongest inlier structures come out at the top. Like any
robust estimators, this algorithm also has limitations which are described in
detail. Several synthetic and real examples are presented to illustrate every
aspect of the algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We investigated the possibility of using a machine-learning scheme in
conjunction with commercial wearable EEG-devices for translating listener's
subjective experience of music into scores that can be used for the automated
annotation of music in popular on-demand streaming services. Based on the
established -neuroscientifically sound- concepts of brainwave frequency bands,
activation asymmetry index and cross-frequency-coupling (CFC), we introduce a
Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system that automatically assigns a rating score
to the listened song. Our research operated in two distinct stages: i) a
generic feature engineering stage, in which features from signal-analytics were
ranked and selected based on their ability to associate music induced
perturbations in brainwaves with listener's appraisal of music. ii) a
personalization stage, during which the efficiency of ex- treme learning
machines (ELMs) is exploited so as to translate the derived pat- terns into a
listener's score. Encouraging experimental results, from a pragmatic use of the
system, are presented.

 <dc:title>A Theory of Interactive Debugging of Knowledge Bases in Monotonic Logics</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rodler, Patrick</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A broad variety of knowledge-based applications such as recommender, expert,
planning or configuration systems usually operate on the basis of knowledge
represented by means of some logical language. Such a logical knowledge base
(KB) enables intelligent behavior of such systems by allowing them to
automatically reason, answer queries of interest or solve complex real-world
problems. Nowadays, where information acquisition comes at low costs and often
happens automatically, the applied KBs are continuously growing in terms of
size, information content and complexity. These developments foster the
emergence of errors in these KBs and thus pose a significant challenge on all
people and tools involved in KB evolution, maintenance and application.
  If some minimal quality criteria such as logical consistency are not met by
some KB, it becomes useless for knowledge-based applications. To guarantee the
compliance of KBs with given requirements, (non-interactive) KB debuggers have
been proposed. These however often cannot localize all potential faults,
suggest too large or incorrect modifications of the faulty KB or suffer from
poor scalability due to the inherent complexity of the KB debugging problem.
  As a remedy to these issues, based on a well-founded theoretical basis this
work proposes complete, sound and optimal methods for the interactive debugging
of KBs that suggest the one (minimally invasive) error correction of the faulty
KB that yields a repaired KB with exactly the intended semantics. Users, e.g.
domain experts, are involved in the debugging process by answering
automatically generated queries whether some given statements must or must not
hold in the domain that should be modeled by the problematic KB at hand.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of next frame prediction from video input. A
recurrent convolutional neural network is trained to predict depth from
monocular video input, which, along with the current video image and the camera
trajectory, can then be used to compute the next frame. Unlike prior next-frame
prediction approaches, we take advantage of the scene geometry and use the
predicted depth for generating the next frame prediction. Our approach can
produce rich next frame predictions which include depth information attached to
each pixel. Another novel aspect of our approach is that it predicts depth from
a sequence of images (e.g. in a video), rather than from a single still image.
We evaluate the proposed approach on the KITTI dataset, a standard dataset for
benchmarking tasks relevant to autonomous driving. The proposed method produces
results which are visually and numerically superior to existing methods that
directly predict the next frame. We show that the accuracy of depth prediction
improves as more prior frames are considered.

 <dc:description>  The field of succinct data structures has flourished over the last 16 years.
Starting from the compressed suffix array (CSA) by Grossi and Vitter (STOC
2000) and the FM-index by Ferragina and Manzini (FOCS 2000), a number of
generalizations and applications of string indexes based on the Burrows-Wheeler
transform (BWT) have been developed, all taking an amount of space that is
close to the input size in bits. In many large-scale applications, the
construction of the index and its usage need to be considered as one unit of
computation. Efficient string indexing and analysis in small space lies also at
the core of a number of primitives in the data-intensive field of
high-throughput DNA sequencing. We report the following advances in string
indexing and analysis. We show that the BWT of a string $T\in
\{1,\ldots,\sigma\}^n$ can be built in deterministic $O(n)$ time using just
$O(n\log{\sigma})$ bits of space, where $\sigma \leq n$. Within the same time
and space budget, we can build an index based on the BWT that allows one to
enumerate all the internal nodes of the suffix tree of $T$. Many fundamental
string analysis problems can be mapped to such enumeration, and can thus be
solved in deterministic $O(n)$ time and in $O(n\log{\sigma})$ bits of space
from the input string. We also show how to build many of the existing indexes
based on the BWT, such as the CSA, the compressed suffix tree (CST), and the
bidirectional BWT index, in randomized $O(n)$ time and in $O(n\log{\sigma})$
bits of space. The previously fastest construction algorithms for BWT, CSA and
CST, which used $O(n\log{\sigma})$ bits of space, took $O(n\log{\log{\sigma}})$
time for the first two structures, and $O(n\log^{\epsilon}n)$ time for the
third, where $\epsilon$ is any positive constant. Contrary to the state of the
art, our bidirectional BWT index supports every operation in constant time per
element in its output.

 <dc:description>  We present a sound, complete, and optimal single-pass tableau algorithm for
the alternation-free $\mu$-calculus. The algorithm supports global caching with
intermediate propagation and runs in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(n)}$. In
game-theoretic terms, our algorithm integrates the steps for constructing and
solving the B\&quot;uchi game arising from the input tableau into a single
procedure; this is done on-the-fly, i.e. may terminate before the game has been
fully constructed. This suggests a slogan to the effect that global caching =
game solving on-the-fly. A prototypical implementation shows promising initial
results.

 <dc:description>  Recognizing implicit discourse relations is a challenging but important task
in the field of Natural Language Processing. For such a complex text processing
task, different from previous studies, we argue that it is necessary to
repeatedly read the arguments and dynamically exploit the efficient features
useful for recognizing discourse relations. To mimic the repeated reading
strategy, we propose the neural networks with multi-level attention (NNMA),
combining the attention mechanism and external memories to gradually fix the
attention on some specific words helpful to judging the discourse relations.
Experiments on the PDTB dataset show that our proposed method achieves the
state-of-art results. The visualization of the attention weights also
illustrates the progress that our model observes the arguments on each level
and progressively locates the important words.

 <dc:description>  Privacy-preserving data aggregation in ad hoc networks is a challenging
problem, considering the distributed communication and control requirement,
dynamic network topology, unreliable communication links, etc. The difficulty
is exaggerated when there exist dishonest nodes, and how to ensure privacy,
accuracy, and robustness against dishonest nodes remains an open issue.
Different from the widely used cryptographic approaches, in this paper, we
address this challenging problem by exploiting the distributed consensus
technique. We first propose a secure consensus-based data aggregation (SCDA)
algorithm that guarantees an accurate sum aggregation while preserving the
privacy of sensitive data. Then, to mitigate the pollution from dishonest
nodes, we propose an Enhanced SCDA (E-SCDA) algorithm that allows neighbors to
detect dishonest nodes, and derive the error bound when there are undetectable
dishonest nodes. {We prove the convergence of both SCDA and E-SCDA. We also
prove that the proposed algorithms are $(\epsilon, \sigma)$-data-privacy, and
obtain the mathematical relationship between $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$.}
Extensive simulations have shown that the proposed algorithms have high
accuracy and low complexity, and they are robust against network dynamics and
dishonest nodes.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel marriage of static and dynamic analysis.
Given a large code base with many functions and a mature test suite, we propose
using static analysis to find functions 1) with assertions or other evident
correctness properties (e.g., array bounds requirements or pointer access) and
2) with simple enough control flow and data use to be amenable to
predicate-abstraction based or bounded model checking without human
intervention. Because most such functions in realistic software systems in fact
rely on many input preconditions not specified by the language's type system
(or annotated in any way), we propose using dynamically discovered invariants
based on a program's test suite to characterize likely preconditions, in order
to reduce the problem of false positives. While providing little in the way of
verification, this approach may provide an additional quick and highly scalable
bug-finding method for programs that are usually considered &quot;too large to model
check.&quot; We present a simple example showing that the technique can be useful
for a more typically &quot;model-checkable&quot; code base, even in the presence of a
poorly designed test suite and bad invariants.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we refine the process of computing calibration functions for a
number of multiclass classification surrogate losses. Calibration functions are
a powerful tool for easily converting bounds for the surrogate risk (which can
be computed through well-known methods) into bounds for the true risk, the
probability of making a mistake. They are particularly suitable in
non-parametric settings, where the approximation error can be controlled, and
provide tighter bounds than the common technique of upper-bounding the 0-1 loss
by the surrogate loss.
  The abstract nature of the more sophisticated existing calibration function
results requires calibration functions to be explicitly derived on a
case-by-case basis, requiring repeated efforts whenever bounds for a new
surrogate loss are required. We devise a streamlined analysis that simplifies
the process of deriving calibration functions for a large number of surrogate
losses that have been proposed in the literature. The effort of deriving
calibration functions is then surmised in verifying, for a chosen surrogate
loss, a small number of conditions that we introduce.
  As case studies, we recover existing calibration functions for the well-known
loss of Lee et al. (2004), and also provide novel calibration functions for
well-known losses, including the one-versus-all loss and the logistic
regression loss, plus a number of other losses that have been shown to be
classification-calibrated in the past, but for which no calibration function
had been derived.

 <dc:description>  Recently, there has been a surge of interest in using spectral methods for
estimating latent variable models. However, it is usually assumed that the
distribution of the observations conditioned on the latent variables is either
discrete or belongs to a parametric family. In this paper, we study the
estimation of an $m$-state hidden Markov model (HMM) with only smoothness
assumptions, such as H\&quot;olderian conditions, on the emission densities. By
leveraging some recent advances in continuous linear algebra and numerical
analysis, we develop a computationally efficient spectral algorithm for
learning nonparametric HMMs. Our technique is based on computing an SVD on
nonparametric estimates of density functions by viewing them as
\emph{continuous matrices}. We derive sample complexity bounds via
concentration results for nonparametric density estimation and novel
perturbation theory results for continuous matrices. We implement our method
using Chebyshev polynomial approximations. Our method is competitive with other
baselines on synthetic and real problems and is also very computationally
efficient.

 <dc:title>Analyzing Dependent Placements of Small Cells in a Two-Layer

 <dc:description>  We consider the downlink of a two-layer heterogeneous network, comprising
macro cells (MCs) and small cells (SCs). The existing literature generally
assumes independent placements of the access points (APs) in different layers;
in contrast, we analyze a dependent placement where SC APs are placed at
locations with poor service from the MC layer. Our goal is to obtain an
estimate of the number of SCs required to maintain a target outage rate. Such
an analysis is trivial if the MCs are located according to a Poisson point
process (PPP), which provides a lower bound on performance. Here, we consider
MCs placed on a hexagonal grid, which complements the PPP model by providing an
upper bound on performance. We first provide accurate bounds for the average
interference within a MC when SCs are not used. Then, by obtaining the outage
areas, we estimate the number of SCs required within an MC to overcome outage.
If resource allocation amongst SCs is not used, we show that the problem of
outage is not solved completely, and the residual outage area depends on
whether co-channel or orthogonal SCs are used. Simulations show that a much
smaller residual outage area is obtained with orthogonal SCs.

 <dc:title>Exact rule-based stochastic simulations for systems with unlimited

 <dc:description>  We introduce expandable partial propensity direct method (EPDM) - a new exact
stochastic simulation algorithm suitable for systems involving many interacting
molecular species. The algorithm is especially efficient for sparsely populated
systems, where the number of species that may potentially be generated is much
greater than the number of species actually present in the system at any given
time. The number of operations per reaction scales linearly with the number of
species, but only those which have one or more molecules. To achieve this kind
of performance we are employing a data structure which allows to add and remove
species and their interactions on the fly. When a new specie is added, its
interactions with every other specie are generated dynamically by a set of
user-defined rules. By removing the records involving the species with zero
molecules, we keep the number of species as low as possible. This enables
simulations of systems for which listing all species is not practical. The
algorithm is based on partial propensities direct method (PDM) by Ramaswamy et
al. for sampling trajectories of the chemical master equation.

 <dc:description>  In language recognition, the task of rejecting/differentiating closely spaced
versus acoustically far spaced languages remains a major challenge. For
confusable closely spaced languages, the system needs longer input test
duration material to obtain sufficient information to distinguish between
languages. Alternatively, if languages are distinct and not
acoustically/linguistically similar to others, duration is not a sufficient
remedy. The solution proposed here is to explore duration distribution analysis
for near/far languages based on the Language Recognition i-Vector Machine
Learning Challenge 2015 (LRiMLC15) database. Using this knowledge, we propose a
likelihood ratio based fusion approach that leveraged both score and duration
information. The experimental results show that the use of duration and score
fusion improves language recognition performance by 5% relative in LRiMLC15
cost.

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Safety critical systems involve the tight coupling between potentially
conflicting control objectives and safety constraints. As a means of creating a
formal framework for controlling systems of this form, and with a view toward
automotive applications, this paper develops a methodology that allows safety
conditions -- expressed as control barrier functions -- to be unified with
performance objectives -- expressed as control Lyapunov functions -- in the
context of real-time optimization-based controllers. Safety conditions are
specified in terms of forward invariance of a set, and are verified via two
novel generalizations of barrier functions; in each case, the existence of a
barrier function satisfying Lyapunov-like conditions implies forward invariance
of the set, and the relationship between these two classes of barrier functions
is characterized. In addition, each of these formulations yields a notion of
control barrier function (CBF), providing inequality constraints in the control
input that, when satisfied, again imply forward invariance of the set. Through
these constructions, CBFs can naturally be unified with control Lyapunov
functions (CLFs) in the context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for
the achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to
conditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs). The
mediation of safety and performance through a QP is demonstrated on adaptive
cruise control and lane keeping, two automotive control problems that present
both safety and performance considerations coupled with actuator bounds.

 <dc:description>  Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a particular type of random neural
network models modeling vector data based on the assumption of Bernoulli
distribution. For multi-dimensional and non-binary data, it is necessary to
vectorize and discretize the information in order to apply the conventional
RBM. It is well-known that vectorization would destroy internal structure of
data, and the binary units will limit the applying performance due to fickle
real data. To address the issue, this paper proposes a Matrix variate Gaussian
Restricted Boltzmann Machine (MVGRBM) model for matrix data whose entries
follow Gaussian distributions. Compared with some other RBM algorithm, MVGRBM
can model real value data better and it has good performance in image
classification.

 <dc:title>Asymptotically Optimal Regenerating Codes Over Any Field</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Raviv, Netanel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The study of regenerating codes has advanced tremendously in recent years.
However, most known constructions require large field size, and hence may be
hard to implement in practice. By using notions from the theory of extension
fields, we obtain two explicit constructions of regenerating codes. These codes
approach the cut-set bound as the reconstruction degree increases, and may be
realized over any given field if the file size is large enough. Since
distributed storage systems are the main purpose of regenerating codes, this
file size restriction is trivially satisfied in most conceivable scenarios. The
first construction attains the cut-set bound at the MBR point asymptotically
for all parameters, whereas the second one attains the cut-set bound at the MSR
point asymptotically for low-rate parameters.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes OCR++, an open-source framework designed for a variety of
information extraction tasks from scholarly articles including metadata (title,
author names, affiliation and e-mail), structure (section headings and body
text, table and figure headings, URLs and footnotes) and bibliography (citation
instances and references). We analyze a diverse set of scientific articles
written in English language to understand generic writing patterns and
formulate rules to develop this hybrid framework. Extensive evaluations show
that the proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art tools
with huge margin in structural information extraction along with improved
performance in metadata and bibliography extraction tasks, both in terms of
accuracy (around 50% improvement) and processing time (around 52% improvement).
A user experience study conducted with the help of 30 researchers reveals that
the researchers found this system to be very helpful. As an additional
objective, we discuss two novel use cases including automatically extracting
links to public datasets from the proceedings, which would further accelerate
the advancement in digital libraries. The result of the framework can be
exported as a whole into structured TEI-encoded documents. Our framework is
accessible online at http://cnergres.iitkgp.ac.in/OCR++/home/.

 <dc:description>  Interpersonal relation defines the association, e.g., warm, friendliness, and
dominance, between two or more people. Motivated by psychological studies, we
investigate if such fine-grained and high-level relation traits can be
characterized and quantified from face images in the wild. We address this
challenging problem by first studying a deep network architecture for robust
recognition of facial expressions. Unlike existing models that typically learn
from facial expression labels alone, we devise an effective multitask network
that is capable of learning from rich auxiliary attributes such as gender, age,
and head pose, beyond just facial expression data. While conventional
supervised training requires datasets with complete labels (e.g., all samples
must be labeled with gender, age, and expression), we show that this
requirement can be relaxed via a novel attribute propagation method. The
approach further allows us to leverage the inherent correspondences between
heterogeneous attribute sources despite the disparate distributions of
different datasets. With the network we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on
existing facial expression recognition benchmarks. To predict inter-personal
relation, we use the expression recognition network as branches for a Siamese
model. Extensive experiments show that our model is capable of mining mutual
context of faces for accurate fine-grained interpersonal prediction.

 <dc:description>  The problem of attaining energy efficiency in distributed systems is of
importance, but a general, non-domain-specific theory of energy-minimal
scheduling is far from developed. In this paper, we classify the problems of
energy-minimal scheduling and present theoretical foundations of the same. We
derive results concerning energy-minimal scheduling of independent jobs in a
distributed system with functionally similar machines with different working
and idle power ratings. The machines considered in our system can have
identical as well as different speeds. If the jobs can be divided into
arbitrary parts, we show that the minimum-energy schedule can be generated in
linear time and give exact scheduling algorithms. For the cases where jobs are
non-divisible, we prove that the scheduling problems are NP-hard and also give
approximation algorithms for the same along with their bounds.

 <dc:title>Optimal and scalable methods to approximate the solutions of large-scale

 <dc:description>  This paper provides a detailed theoretical analysis of methods to approximate
the solutions of high-dimensional (&gt;10^6) linear Bayesian problems. An optimal
low-rank projection that maximizes the information content of the Bayesian
inversion is proposed and efficiently constructed using a scalable randomized
SVD algorithm. Useful optimality results are established for the associated
posterior error covariance matrix and posterior mean approximations, which are
further investigated in a numerical experiment consisting of a large-scale
atmospheric tracer transport source-inversion problem. This method proves to be
a robust and efficient approach to dimension reduction, as well as a natural
framework to analyze the information content of the inversion. Possible
extensions of this approach to the non-linear framework in the context of
operational numerical weather forecast data assimilation systems based on the
incremental 4D-Var technique are also discussed, and a detailed implementation
of a new Randomized Incremental Optimal Technique (RIOT) for 4D-Var algorithms
leveraging our theoretical results is proposed.

 <dc:description>  -We develop a polar coding scheme for empirical coordination in a two-node
network with a noisy link in which the input and output signals have to be
coordinated with the source and the reconstruction. In the case of non-causal
encoding and decoding, we show that polar codes achieve the best known inner
bound for the empirical coordination region, provided that a vanishing rate of
common randomness is available. This scheme provides a constructive alternative
to random binning and coding proofs.

 <dc:description>  Partial least squares regression (PLSR) has been a popular technique to
explore the linear relationship between two datasets. However, most of
algorithm implementations of PLSR may only achieve a suboptimal solution
through an optimization on the Euclidean space. In this paper, we propose
several novel PLSR models on Riemannian manifolds and develop optimization
algorithms based on Riemannian geometry of manifolds. This algorithm can
calculate all the factors of PLSR globally to avoid suboptimal solutions. In a
number of experiments, we have demonstrated the benefits of applying the
proposed model and algorithm to a variety of learning tasks in pattern
recognition and object classification.

 <dc:description>  Despite the great success of using gradient-based controllers to stabilize
rigid formations of autonomous agents in the past years, surprising yet
intriguing undesirable collective motions have been reported recently when
inconsistent measurements are used in the agents' local controllers. To make
the existing gradient control robust against such measurement inconsistency, we
exploit local estimators following the well known internal model principle for
robust output regulation control. The new estimator-based gradient control is
still distributed in nature and can be constructed systematically even when the
number of agents in a rigid formation grows. We prove rigorously that the
proposed control is able to guarantee exponential convergence and then
demonstrate through robotic experiments and computer simulations that the
reported inconsistency-induced orbits of collective movements are effectively
eliminated.

 <dc:description>  Decision making in modern large-scale and complex systems such as
communication networks, smart electricity grids, and cyber-physical systems
motivate novel game-theoretic approaches. This paper investigates big strategic
(non-cooperative) games where a finite number of individual players each have a
large number of continuous decision variables and input data points. Such
high-dimensional decision spaces and big data sets lead to computational
challenges, relating to efforts in non-linear optimization scaling up to large
systems of variables. In addition to these computational challenges, real-world
players often have limited information about their preference parameters due to
the prohibitive cost of identifying them or due to operating in dynamic online
settings. The challenge of limited information is exacerbated in high
dimensions and big data sets. Motivated by both computational and information
limitations that constrain the direct solution of big strategic games, our
investigation centers around reductions using linear transformations such as
random projection methods and their effect on Nash equilibrium solutions.
Specific analytical results are presented for quadratic games and
approximations. In addition, an adversarial learning game is presented where
random projection and sampling schemes are investigated.

 <dc:description>  To dynamically detect the facial landmarks in the video, we propose a novel
hybrid framework termed as detection-tracking-detection (DTD). First, the face
bounding box is achieved from the first frame of the video sequence based on a
traditional face detection method. Then, a landmark detector detects the facial
landmarks, which is based on a cascaded deep convolution neural network (DCNN).
Next, the face bounding box in the current frame is estimated and validated
after the facial landmarks in the previous frame are tracked based on the
median flow. Finally, the facial landmarks in the current frame are exactly
detected from the validated face bounding box via the landmark detector.
Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can detect the facial
landmarks in the video sequence more effectively and with lower consuming time
compared to the frame-by-frame method via the DCNN.

 <dc:title>Minimizing Compression Artifacts for High Resolutions with Adaptive
  Quantization Matrices for HEVC</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Prangnell, Lee</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sanchez, Victor</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Visual Display Units (VDUs), capable of displaying video data at High
Definition (HD) and Ultra HD (UHD) resolutions, are frequently employed in a
variety of technological domains. Quantization-induced video compression
artifacts, which are usually unnoticeable in low resolution environments, are
typically conspicuous on high resolution VDUs and video data. The default
quantization matrices (QMs) in HEVC do not take into account specific display
resolutions of VDUs or video data to determine the appropriate levels of
quantization required to reduce unwanted compression artifacts. Therefore, we
propose a novel, adaptive quantization matrix technique for the HEVC standard
including Scalable HEVC (SHVC). Our technique, which is based on a refinement
of the current QM technique in HEVC, takes into consideration specific display
resolutions of the target VDUs in order to minimize compression artifacts. We
undertake a thorough evaluation of the proposed technique by utilizing SHVC SHM
9.0 (two-layered bit-stream) and the BD-Rate and SSIM metrics. For the BD-Rate
evaluation, the proposed method achieves maximum BD-Rate reductions of 56.5% in
the enhancement layer. For the SSIM evaluation, our technique achieves a
maximum structural improvement of 0.8660 vs. 0.8538.

 <dc:description>  Mobility as a Service (MaaS) applies the everything-as-a-service paradigm of
Cloud Computing to transportation: a MaaS provider offers to its users the
dynamic composition of solutions of different travel agencies into a single,
consistent interface. Traditionally, transits and data on mobility belong to a
scattered plethora of operators. Thus, we argue that the economic model of MaaS
is that of federations of providers, each trading its resources to coordinate
multi-modal solutions for mobility. Such flexibility comes with many security
and privacy concerns, of which insider threat is one of the most prominent. In
this paper, we follow a tiered structure --- from individual operators to
markets of federated MaaS providers --- to classify the potential threats of
each tier and propose the appropriate countermeasures, in an effort to mitigate
the problems.

 <dc:title>Multi-View Constraint Propagation with Consensus Prior Knowledge</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Yaoyi</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In many applications, the pairwise constraint is a kind of weaker supervisory
information which can be collected easily. The constraint propagation has been
proved to be a success of exploiting such side-information. In recent years,
some methods of multi-view constraint propagation have been proposed. However,
the problem of reasonably fusing different views remains unaddressed. In this
paper, we present a method dubbed Consensus Prior Constraint Propagation
(CPCP), which can provide the prior knowledge of the robustness of each data
instance and its neighborhood. With the robustness generated from the consensus
information of each view, we build a unified affinity matrix as a result of the
propagation. Specifically, we fuse the affinity of different views at a data
instance level instead of a view level. This paper also introduces an approach
to deal with the imbalance between the positive and negative constraints. The
proposed method has been tested in clustering tasks on two publicly available
multi-view data sets to show the superior performance.

 <dc:description>  One of the longstanding problems in spectral graph clustering (SGC) is the
so-called model order selection problem: automated selection of the correct
number of clusters. This is equivalent to the problem of finding the number of
connected components or communities in an undirected graph. In this paper, we
propose AMOS, an automated model order selection algorithm for SGC. Based on a
recent analysis of clustering reliability for SGC under the random
interconnection model, AMOS works by incrementally increasing the number of
clusters, estimating the quality of identified clusters, and providing a series
of clustering reliability tests. Consequently, AMOS outputs clusters of minimal
model order with statistical clustering reliability guarantees. Comparing to
three other automated graph clustering methods on real-world datasets, AMOS
shows superior performance in terms of multiple external and internal
clustering metrics.

 <dc:description>  The paper treats uplink scenario where M user equipments (UEs) send to a Base
Station (BS), possibly via a common Relay Station (RS) that is equipped with a
buffer. This is a multiple-access relay channel (MARC) aided by a buffer. We
devise a protocol in which the transmission mode is selected adaptively, using
the buffer at the RS in order to maximize the average system throughput. We
consider the general case in which the RS and the BS can have limits on the
maximal number of transmitters that can be received over the multiple access
channel. In each slot there are three type possible actions: (A1) multiple UEs
transmit at rates that enable BS to decode them (A2) multiple UEs transmit, the
BS can only decode the messages partially, while the RS completely; (A3) RS
forwards the side information to BS about the partially decoded messages, which
are going to be combined and decoded entirely at the BS, while simultaneously a
number of UEs sends new messages to the BS. The results show that the adaptive
selection of direct and buffer-aided relay transmissions leads to significant
average throughput gains.

 <dc:description>  Both dialogue systems and chatbots aim at putting into action communication
between humans and computers. However, instead of focusing on sophisticated
techniques to perform natural language understanding, as the former usually do,
chatbots seek to mimic conversation. Since Eliza, the first chatbot ever,
developed in 1966, there were many interesting ideas explored by the chatbots'
community. Actually, more than just ideas, some chatbots' developers also
provide free resources, including tools and large-scale corpora. It is our
opinion that this know-how and materials should not be neglected, as they might
be put to use in the human-computer communication field (and some authors
already do it). Thus, in this paper we present a historical overview of the
chatbots' developments, we review what we consider to be the main contributions
of this community, and we point to some possible ways of coupling these with
current work in the human-computer communication research line.

 <dc:description>  Molecular profiling data (e.g., gene expression) has been used for clinical
risk prediction and biomarker discovery. However, it is necessary to integrate
other prior knowledge like biological pathways or gene interaction networks to
improve the predictive ability and biological interpretability of biomarkers.
Here, we first introduce a general regularized Logistic Regression (LR)
framework with regularized term $\lambda \|\bm{w}\|_1 +
\eta\bm{w}^T\bm{M}\bm{w}$, which can reduce to different penalties, including
Lasso, elastic net, and network-regularized terms with different $\bm{M}$. This
framework can be easily solved in a unified manner by a cyclic coordinate
descent algorithm which can avoid inverse matrix operation and accelerate the
computing speed. However, if those estimated $\bm{w}_i$ and $\bm{w}_j$ have
opposite signs, then the traditional network-regularized penalty may not
perform well. To address it, we introduce a novel network-regularized sparse LR
model with a new penalty $\lambda \|\bm{w}\|_1 + \eta|\bm{w}|^T\bm{M}|\bm{w}|$
to consider the difference between the absolute values of the coefficients. And
we develop two efficient algorithms to solve it. Finally, we test our methods
and compare them with the related ones using simulated and real data to show
their efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Neural machine translation (NMT) becomes a new state-of-the-art and achieves
promising translation results using a simple encoder-decoder neural network.
This neural network is trained once on the parallel corpus and the fixed
network is used to translate all the test sentences. We argue that the general
fixed network cannot best fit the specific test sentences. In this paper, we
propose the dynamic NMT which learns a general network as usual, and then
fine-tunes the network for each test sentence. The fine-tune work is done on a
small set of the bilingual training data that is obtained through similarity
search according to the test sentence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
this method can significantly improve the translation performance, especially
when highly similar sentences are available.

 <dc:description>  The paper introduces a new method for discrimination of documents given in
different scripts. The document is mapped into a uniformly coded text of
numerical values. It is derived from the position of the letters in the text
line, based on their typographical characteristics. Each code is considered as
a gray level. Accordingly, the coded text determines a 1-D image, on which
texture analysis by run-length statistics and local binary pattern is
performed. It defines feature vectors representing the script content of the
document. A modified clustering approach employed on document feature vector
groups documents written in the same script. Experimentation performed on two
custom oriented databases of historical documents in old Cyrillic, angular and
round Glagolitic as well as Antiqua and Fraktur scripts demonstrates the
superiority of the proposed method with respect to well-known methods in the
state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  Segmentation is the process of identifying object outlines within images.
There are a number of efficient algorithms for segmentation in Euclidean space
that depend on the variational approach and partial differential equation
modelling. Wavelets have been used successfully in various problems in image
processing, including segmentation, inpainting, noise removal, super-resolution
image restoration, and many others. Wavelets on the sphere have been developed
to solve such problems for data defined on the sphere, which arise in numerous
fields such as cosmology and geophysics. In this work, we propose a
wavelet-based method to segment images on the sphere, accounting for the
underlying geometry of spherical data. Our method is a direct extension of the
tight-frame based segmentation method used to automatically identify tube-like
structures such as blood vessels in medical imaging. It is compatible with any
arbitrary type of wavelet frame defined on the sphere, such as axisymmetric
wavelets, directional wavelets, curvelets, and hybrid wavelet constructions.
Such an approach allows the desirable properties of wavelets to be naturally
inherited in the segmentation process. In particular, directional wavelets and
curvelets, which were designed to efficiently capture directional signal
content, provide additional advantages in segmenting images containing
prominent directional and curvilinear features. We present several numerical
experiments, applying our wavelet-based segmentation method, as well as the
common K-means method, on real-world spherical images. These experiments
demonstrate the superiority of our method and show that it is capable of
segmenting different kinds of spherical images, including those with prominent
directional features. Moreover, our algorithm is efficient with convergence
usually within a few iterations.

 <dc:title>Global Versus Local Computations: Fast Computing with Identifiers</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper studies what can be computed by using probabilistic local
interactions with agents with a very restricted power in polylogarithmic
parallel time. It is known that if agents are only finite state (corresponding
to the Population Protocol model by Angluin et al.), then only semilinear
predicates over the global input can be computed. In fact, if the population
starts with a unique leader, these predicates can even be computed in a
polylogarithmic parallel time. If identifiers are added (corresponding to the
Community Protocol model by Guerraoui and Ruppert), then more global predicates
over the input multiset can be computed. Local predicates over the input sorted
according to the identifiers can also be computed, as long as the identifiers
are ordered. The time of some of those predicates might require exponential
parallel time. In this paper, we consider what can be computed with Community
Protocol in a polylogarithmic number of parallel interactions. We introduce the
class CPPL corresponding to protocols that use $O(n\log^k n)$, for some k,
expected interactions to compute their predicates, or equivalently a
polylogarithmic number of parallel expected interactions. We provide some
computable protocols, some boundaries of the class, using the fact that the
population can compute its size. We also prove two impossibility results
providing some arguments showing that local computations are no longer easy:
the population does not have the time to compare a linear number of consecutive
identifiers. The Linearly Local languages, such that the rational language
$(ab)^*$, are not computable.

 <dc:title>SIS epidemics on Triadic Random Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rausch, Ilja</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It has been shown in the past that many real-world networks exhibit community
structures and non-trivial clustering which comes with the occurrence of a
notable number of triangular connections. Yet the influence of such connection
patterns on the dynamics of disease transmission is not fully understood. In
order to study their role in the context of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible
(SIS) epidemics we use the Triadic Random Graph (TRG) model to construct small
networks (N=49) from distinct, closed, directed triadic subpatterns. We compare
various global properties of TRGs and use the N-intertwined mean-field
approximation (NIMFA) model to perform numerical simulations of SIS-dynamics on
TRGs. The results show that the infection spread on undirected TRGs displays
very similar behavior to TRGs with an abundance of (directed) feed-back-loops,
while using (directed) feed-forward-loops as network-entities significantly
slows down the epidemic and lowers the number of infected individuals in the
endemic state. Moreover, we introduce a novel stochastic approach for modelling
the SIS-epidemics on TRGs based on characterizing nodes according to their set
of $\left(k_{in},k_{out}\right)$ within triads. Within this model, the topology
of the network is given by the number and the local structure of directed
triadic motifs and not by the adjacency matrix. Nevertheless, the outcome of
simulations is qualitatively similar to the results of the NIMFA model.

 <dc:description>  Spatial aspects of computation are becoming increasingly relevant in Computer
Science, especially in the field of collective adaptive systems and when
dealing with systems distributed in physical space. Traditional formal
verification techniques are well suited to analyse the temporal evolution of
programs; however, properties of space are typically not taken into account
explicitly. We present a topology-based approach to formal verification of
spatial properties depending upon physical space. We define an appropriate
logic, stemming from the tradition of topological interpretations of modal
logics, dating back to earlier logicians such as Tarski, where modalities
describe neighbourhood. We lift the topological definitions to the more general
setting of closure spaces, also encompassing discrete, graph-based structures.
We extend the framework with a spatial surrounded operator, a propagation
operator and with some collective operators. The latter are interpreted over
arbitrary sets of points instead of individual points in space. We define
efficient model checking procedures, both for the individual and the collective
spatial fragments of the logic and provide a proof-of-concept tool.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we prove that the numerical-semigroup-gap counting problem is
#NP-complete as a main theorem. A numerical semigroup is an additive semigroup
over the set of all nonnegative integers. A gap of a numerical semigroup is
defined as a positive integer that does not belong to the numerical semigroup.
The computation of gaps of numerical semigroups has been actively studied from
the 19th century. However, little has been known on the computational
complexity. In 2005, Ramirez-Alfonsin proposed a question whether or not the
numerical-semigroup-gap counting problem is #P-complete. This work is an answer
for his question. For proving the main theorem, we show the #NP-completenesses
of other two variants of the numerical-semigroup-gap counting problem.

 <dc:description>  The paper treats a multiuser relay scenario where multiple user equipments
(UEs) have a two-way communication with a common Base Station (BS) in the
presence of a buffer-equipped Relay Station (RS). Each of the uplink (UL) and
downlink (DL) transmission can take place over a direct or over a relayed path.
Traditionally, the UL and the DL path of a given two-way link are coupled, that
is, either both are direct links or both are relayed links. By removing the
restriction for coupling, one opens the design space for a decoupled two-way
links. Following this, we devise two protocols: orthogonal decoupled UL/DL
buffer-aided (ODBA) relaying protocol and non-orthogonal decoupled UL/DL
buffer-aided (NODBA) relaying protocol. In NODBA, the receiver can use
successive interference cancellation (SIC) to extract the desired signal from a
collision between UL and DL signals. For both protocols, we characterize the
transmission decision policies in terms of maximization of the average two-way
sum rate of the system. The numerical results show that decoupling association
and non-orthogonal radio access lead to significant throughput gains for
two-way traffic.

 <dc:title>Don't Be Greedy: Leveraging Community Structure to Find High Quality
  Seed Sets for Influence Maximization</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of maximizing the spread of influence in a social
network by choosing a fixed number of initial seeds --- a central problem in
the study of network cascades. The majority of existing work on this problem,
formally referred to as the influence maximization problem, is designed for
submodular cascades. Despite the empirical evidence that many cascades are
non-submodular, little work has been done focusing on non-submodular influence
maximization.
  We propose a new heuristic for solving the influence maximization problem and
show via simulations on real-world and synthetic networks that our algorithm
outputs more influential seed sets than the state-of-the-art greedy algorithm
in many natural cases, with average improvements of 7% for submodular cascades,
and 55% for non-submodular cascades. Our heuristic uses a dynamic programming
approach on a hierarchical decomposition of the social network to leverage the
relation between the spread of cascades and the community structure of social
networks. We verify the importance of network structure by showing the quality
of the hierarchical decomposition impacts the quality of seed set output by our
algorithm. We also present &quot;worst-case&quot; theoretical results proving that in
certain settings our algorithm outputs seed sets that are a factor of
$\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ more influential than those of the greedy algorithm, where
$n$ is the number of nodes in the network. Finally, we generalize our algorithm
to a message passing version that can be used to find seed sets that have at
least as much influence as the dynamic programming algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Let G be a graph with minimum degree $\delta$. It is well-known that maximal
adjacency orderings (MAOs) compute a vertex set S such that every pair of S is
connected by at least $\delta$ internally vertex-disjoint paths in G.
  We present an algorithm that, given any pair of S, computes these $\delta$
paths in linear time O(n+m). This improves the previously best solutions for
these special vertex pairs, which were flow-based. Our algorithm simplifies a
proof about pendant pairs of Mader and makes a purely existential proof of
Nagamochi algorithmic.

 <dc:description>  Data exchange is the problem of transforming data that is structured under
the source schema into data structured under another schema, called the target
schema, so that both source and target data satisfy the relationship between
the schemas. Many applications such as planning, scheduling, medical and fraud
detection systems, require data exchange in the context of temporal data. Even
though the formal framework of data exchange for relational database systems is
well-established, it does not immediately carry over to the setting of temporal
data, which necessitates reasoning over unbounded periods of time. In this
work, we study data exchange for temporal data. We first motivate the need for
two views of temporal data: the concrete view, which depicts how temporal data
is compactly represented and on which implementations are based, and the
abstract view, which defines the semantics of temporal data. We show how the
framework of data exchange can be systematically extended to temporal data. The
core of our framework consists of two new chase algorithms: the abstract chase
over an abstract temporal instance and the concrete chase over a concrete
temporal instance. We show that although the two chase procedures operate over
fundamentally different views of temporal data, the result of the concrete
chase is semantically aligned with the result of the abstract chase. To obtain
the semantic alignment, the nulls (which are introduced by data exchange and
model incompleteness) in both the concrete view and the abstract view are
annotated with temporal information. Furthermore, we show that the result of
the concrete chase provides a foundation for query answering. We define na\&quot;ive
evaluation on the result of the concrete chase and show it produces certain
answers.

 <dc:description>  Recent work on unsupervised term discovery (UTD) aims to identify and cluster
repeated word-like units from audio alone. These systems are promising for some
very low-resource languages where transcribed audio is unavailable, or where no
written form of the language exists. However, in some cases it may still be
feasible (e.g., through crowdsourcing) to obtain (possibly noisy) text
translations of the audio. If so, this information could be used as a source of
side information to improve UTD. Here, we present a simple method for rescoring
the output of a UTD system using text translations, and test it on a corpus of
Spanish audio with English translations. We show that it greatly improves the
average precision of the results over a wide range of system configurations and
data preprocessing methods.

 <dc:description>  Bibliographic analysis considers the author's research areas, the citation
network and the paper content among other things. In this paper, we combine
these three in a topic model that produces a bibliographic model of authors,
topics and documents, using a nonparametric extension of a combination of the
Poisson mixed-topic link model and the author-topic model. This gives rise to
the Citation Network Topic Model (CNTM). We propose a novel and efficient
inference algorithm for the CNTM to explore subsets of research publications
from CiteSeerX. The publication datasets are organised into three corpora,
totalling to about 168k publications with about 62k authors. The queried
datasets are made available online. In three publicly available corpora in
addition to the queried datasets, our proposed model demonstrates an improved
performance in both model fitting and document clustering, compared to several
baselines. Moreover, our model allows extraction of additional useful knowledge
from the corpora, such as the visualisation of the author-topics network.
Additionally, we propose a simple method to incorporate supervision into topic
modelling to achieve further improvement on the clustering task.

 <dc:title>On Data-Independent Properties for Density-Based Dissimilarity Measures

 <dc:description>  Hybrid clustering combines partitional and hierarchical clustering for
computational effectiveness and versatility in cluster shape. In such
clustering, a dissimilarity measure plays a crucial role in the hierarchical
merging. The dissimilarity measure has great impact on the final clustering,
and data-independent properties are needed to choose the right dissimilarity
measure for the problem at hand. Properties for distance-based dissimilarity
measures have been studied for decades, but properties for density-based
dissimilarity measures have so far received little attention. Here, we propose
six data-independent properties to evaluate density-based dissimilarity
measures associated with hybrid clustering, regarding equality, orthogonality,
symmetry, outlier and noise observations, and light-tailed models for
heavy-tailed clusters. The significance of the properties is investigated, and
we study some well-known dissimilarity measures based on Shannon entropy,
misclassification rate, Bhattacharyya distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence
with respect to the proposed properties. As none of them satisfy all the
proposed properties, we introduce a new dissimilarity measure based on the
Kullback-Leibler information and show that it satisfies all proposed
properties. The effect of the proposed properties is also illustrated on
several real and simulated data sets.

 <dc:description>  We present a real-time deep learning framework for video-based facial
performance capture -- the dense 3D tracking of an actor's face given a
monocular video. Our pipeline begins with accurately capturing a subject using
a high-end production facial capture pipeline based on multi-view stereo
tracking and artist-enhanced animations. With 5-10 minutes of captured footage,
we train a convolutional neural network to produce high-quality output,
including self-occluded regions, from a monocular video sequence of that
subject. Since this 3D facial performance capture is fully automated, our
system can drastically reduce the amount of labor involved in the development
of modern narrative-driven video games or films involving realistic digital
doubles of actors and potentially hours of animated dialogue per character. We
compare our results with several state-of-the-art monocular real-time facial
capture techniques and demonstrate compelling animation inference in
challenging areas such as eyes and lips.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the Optional Prisoner's Dilemma game in a spatial environment,
with coevolutionary rules for both the strategy and network links between
agents, is studied. Using a Monte Carlo simulation approach, a number of
experiments are performed to identify favourable configurations of the
environment for the emergence of cooperation in adverse scenarios. Results show
that abstainers play a key role in the protection of cooperators against
exploitation from defectors. Scenarios of cyclic competition and of full
dominance of cooperation are also observed. This work provides insights towards
gaining an in-depth understanding of the emergence of cooperative behaviour in
real-world systems.

 <dc:description>  It has been previously noted that optimization of the n-call@k relevance
objective (i.e., a set-based objective that is 1 if at least n documents in a
set of k are relevant, otherwise 0) encourages more result set diversification
for smaller n, but this statement has never been formally quantified. In this
work, we explicitly derive the mathematical relationship between expected
n-call@k and the relevance vs. diversity trade-off --- through fortuitous
cancellations in the resulting combinatorial optimization, we show the
trade-off is a simple and intuitive function of n (notably independent of the
result set size k e n), where diversification increases as n approaches 1.

 <dc:description>  Feature selection methods are usually evaluated by wrapping specific
classifiers and datasets in the evaluation process, resulting very often in
unfair comparisons between methods. In this work, we develop a theoretical
framework that allows obtaining the true feature ordering of two-dimensional
sequential forward feature selection methods based on mutual information, which
is independent of entropy or mutual information estimation methods,
classifiers, or datasets, and leads to an undoubtful comparison of the methods.
Moreover, the theoretical framework unveils problems intrinsic to some methods
that are otherwise difficult to detect, namely inconsistencies in the
construction of the objective function used to select the candidate features,
due to various types of indeterminations and to the possibility of the entropy
of continuous random variables taking null and negative values.

 <dc:description>  New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) are drugs that lay in a grey area of
legislation, since they are not internationally and officially banned, possibly
leading to their not prosecutable trade. The exacerbation of the phenomenon is
that NPS can be easily sold and bought online. Here, we consider large corpora
of textual posts, published on online forums specialized on drug discussions,
plus a small set of known substances and associated effects, which we call
seeds. We propose a semi-supervised approach to knowledge extraction, applied
to the detection of drugs (comprising NPS) and effects from the corpora under
investigation. Based on the very small set of initial seeds, the work
highlights how a contrastive approach and context deduction are effective in
detecting substances and effects from the corpora. Our promising results, which
feature a F1 score close to 0.9, pave the way for shortening the detection time
of new psychoactive substances, once these are discussed and advertised on the
Internet.

 <dc:description>  Aspect-based opinion mining is widely applied to review data to aggregate or
summarize opinions of a product, and the current state-of-the-art is achieved
with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based model. Although social media data
like tweets are laden with opinions, their &quot;dirty&quot; nature (as natural language)
has discouraged researchers from applying LDA-based opinion model for product
review mining. Tweets are often informal, unstructured and lacking labeled data
such as categories and ratings, making it challenging for product opinion
mining. In this paper, we propose an LDA-based opinion model named Twitter
Opinion Topic Model (TOTM) for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. TOTM
leverages hashtags, mentions, emoticons and strong sentiment words that are
present in tweets in its discovery process. It improves opinion prediction by
modeling the target-opinion interaction directly, thus discovering target
specific opinion words, neglected in existing approaches. Moreover, we propose
a new formulation of incorporating sentiment prior information into a topic
model, by utilizing an existing public sentiment lexicon. This is novel in that
it learns and updates with the data. We conduct experiments on 9 million tweets
on electronic products, and demonstrate the improved performance of TOTM in
both quantitative evaluations and qualitative analysis. We show that
aspect-based opinion analysis on massive volume of tweets provides useful
opinions on products.

 <dc:description>  Location data can be extremely useful to study commuting patterns and
disruptions, as well as to predict real-time traffic volumes. At the same time,
however, the fine-grained collection of user locations raises serious privacy
concerns, as this can reveal sensitive information about the users, such as,
life style, political and religious inclinations, or even identities. In this
paper, we study the feasibility of crowd-sourced mobility analytics over
aggregate location information: users periodically report their location, using
a privacy-preserving aggregation protocol, so that the server can only recover
aggregates -- i.e., how many, but not which, users are in a region at a given
time. We experiment with real-world mobility datasets obtained from the
Transport For London authority and the San Francisco Cabs network, and present
a novel methodology based on time series modeling that is geared to forecast
traffic volumes in regions of interest and to detect mobility anomalies in
them. In the presence of anomalies, we also make enhanced traffic volume
predictions by feeding our model with additional information from correlated
regions. Finally, we present and evaluate a mobile app prototype, called
Mobility Data Donors (MDD), in terms of computation, communication, and energy
overhead, demonstrating the real-world deployability of our techniques.

 <dc:description>  Introduced in the mid-1970's as an intermediate step in proving a
long-standing conjecture on arithmetic progressions, Szemer\'edi's regularity
lemma has emerged over time as a fundamental tool in different branches of
graph theory, combinatorics and theoretical computer science. Roughly, it
states that every graph can be approximated by the union of a small number of
random-like bipartite graphs called regular pairs. In other words, the result
provides us a way to obtain a good description of a large graph using a small
amount of data, and can be regarded as a manifestation of the all-pervading
dichotomy between structure and randomness. In this paper we will provide an
overview of the regularity lemma and its algorithmic aspects, and will discuss
its relevance in the context of pattern recognition research.

 <dc:description>  Image denoising is a fundamental operation in image processing and holds
considerable practical importance for various real-world applications. Arguably
several thousands of papers are dedicated to image denoising. In the past
decade, sate-of-the-art denoising algorithm have been clearly dominated by
non-local patch-based methods, which explicitly exploit patch self-similarity
within image. However, in recent two years, discriminatively trained local
approaches have started to outperform previous non-local models and have been
attracting increasing attentions due to the additional advantage of
computational efficiency. Successful approaches include cascade of shrinkage
fields (CSF) and trainable nonlinear reaction diffusion (TNRD). These two
methods are built on filter response of linear filters of small size using feed
forward architectures. Due to the locality inherent in local approaches, the
CSF and TNRD model become less effective when noise level is high and
consequently introduces some noise artifacts. In order to overcome this
problem, in this paper we introduce a multi-scale strategy. To be specific, we
build on our newly-developed TNRD model, adopting the multi-scale pyramid image
representation to devise a multi-scale nonlinear diffusion process. As
expected, all the parameters in the proposed multi-scale diffusion model,
including the filters and the influence functions across scales, are learned
from training data through a loss based approach. Numerical results on Gaussian
and Poisson denoising substantiate that the exploited multi-scale strategy can
successfully boost the performance of the original TNRD model with single
scale. As a consequence, the resulting multi-scale diffusion models can
significantly suppress the typical incorrect features for those noisy images
with heavy noise.

 <dc:description>  Relatively small data sets available for expression recognition research make
the training of deep networks for expression recognition very challenging.
Although fine-tuning can partially alleviate the issue, the performance is
still below acceptable levels as the deep features probably contain redun- dant
information from the pre-trained domain. In this paper, we present
FaceNet2ExpNet, a novel idea to train an expression recognition network based
on static images. We first propose a new distribution function to model the
high-level neurons of the expression network. Based on this, a two-stage
training algorithm is carefully designed. In the pre-training stage, we train
the convolutional layers of the expression net, regularized by the face net; In
the refining stage, we append fully- connected layers to the pre-trained
convolutional layers and train the whole network jointly. Visualization shows
that the model trained with our method captures improved high-level expression
semantics. Evaluations on four public expression databases, CK+, Oulu-CASIA,
TFD, and SFEW demonstrate that our method achieves better results than
state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  This work introduces and characterizes a fast parameterless filter based on
the Helgason-Ludwig consistency conditions, used to improve the accuracy of
analytical reconstructions of tomographic undersampled datasets. The filter,
acting in the Radon domain, extrapolates intermediate projections between those
existing. The resulting sinogram, doubled in views, is then reconstructed by a
standard analytical method. Experiments with simulated data prove that the
peak-signal-to-noise ratio of the results computed by filtered backprojection
is improved up to 5-6 dB, if the filter is used prior to reconstruction.

 <dc:title>Multimedia Communication Quality Assessment Testbeds</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We make an intensive use of multimedia frameworks in our research on modeling
the perceived quality estimation in streaming services and real-time
communications. In our preliminary work, we have used the VLC VOD software to
generate reference audiovisual files with various degree of coding and network
degradations. We have successfully built machine learning based models on the
subjective quality dataset we have generated using these files. However,
imperfections in the dataset introduced by the multimedia framework we have
used prevented us from achieving the full potential of these models.
  In order to develop better models, we have re-created our end-to-end
multimedia pipeline using the GStreamer framework for audio and video
streaming. A GStreamer based pipeline proved to be significantly more robust to
network degradations than the VLC VOD framework and allowed us to stream a
video flow at a loss rate up to 5\% packet very easily. GStreamer has also
enabled us to collect the relevant RTCP statistics that proved to be more
accurate than network-deduced information. This dataset is free to the public.
The accuracy of the statistics eventually helped us to generate better
performing perceived quality estimation models.
  In this paper, we present the implementation of these VLC and GStreamer-based
multimedia communication quality assessment testbeds with the references to
their publicly available code bases.

 <dc:description>  We compare policy differences across institutions by embedding
representations of the entire legal corpus of each institution and the
vocabulary shared across all corpora into a continuous vector space. We apply
our method, Gov2Vec, to Supreme Court opinions, Presidential actions, and
official summaries of Congressional bills. The model discerns meaningful
differences between government branches. We also learn representations for more
fine-grained word sources: individual Presidents and (2-year) Congresses. The
similarities between learned representations of Congresses over time and
sitting Presidents are negatively correlated with the bill veto rate, and the
temporal ordering of Presidents and Congresses was implicitly learned from only
text. With the resulting vectors we answer questions such as: how does Obama
and the 113th House differ in addressing climate change and how does this vary
from environmental or economic perspectives? Our work illustrates
vector-arithmetic-based investigations of complex relationships between word
sources based on their texts. We are extending this to create a more
comprehensive legal semantic map.

 <dc:title>An Analysis of Introductory Programming Courses at UK Universities</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Context: In the context of exploring the art, science and engineering of
programming, the question of which programming languages should be taught first
has been fiercely debated since computer science teaching started in
universities. Failure to grasp programming readily almost certainly implies
failure to progress in computer science. Inquiry: What first programming
languages are being taught? There have been regular national-scale surveys in
Australia and New Zealand, with the only US survey reporting on a small subset
of universities. This the first such national survey of universities in the UK.
Approach: We report the results of the first survey of introductory programming
courses (N=80) taught at UK universities as part of their first year computer
science (or related) degree programmes, conducted in the first half of 2016. We
report on student numbers, programming paradigm, programming languages and
environment/tools used, as well as the underpinning rationale for these
choices. Knowledge: The results in this first UK survey indicate a dominance of
Java at a time when universities are still generally teaching students who are
new to programming (and computer science), despite the fact that Python is
perceived, by the same respondents, to be both easier to teach as well as to
learn. Grounding: We compare the results of this survey with a related survey
conducted since 2010 (as well as earlier surveys from 2001 and 2003) in
Australia and New Zealand. Importance: This survey provides a starting point
for valuable pedagogic baseline data for the analysis of the art, science and
engineering of programming, in the context of substantial computer science
curriculum reform in UK schools, as well as increasing scrutiny of teaching
excellence and graduate employability for UK universities.

 <dc:description>  Given a fixed $k$ $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}^+$ and $\lambda$ $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}^+$,
the objective of a $\lambda$-$L(k, k-1, \ldots, 2, 1)$-labeling of a graph $G$
is to assign non-negative integers (known as labels) from the set $\{0, \ldots,
\lambda-1\}$ to the vertices of $G$ such that the adjacent vertices receive
values which differ by at least $k$, vertices connected by a path of length two
receive values which differ by at least $k-1$, and so on. The vertices which
are at least $k+1$ distance apart can receive the same label. The smallest
$\lambda$ for which there exists a $\lambda$-$L(k, k-1, \ldots, 2, 1)$-labeling
of $G$ is known as the $L(k, k-1, \ldots, 2, 1)$-labeling number of $G$ and is
denoted by $\lambda_k(G)$. The ratio between the upper bound and the lower
bound of a $\lambda$-$L(k, k-1, \ldots, 2, 1)$-labeling is known as the
approximation ratio. In this paper a lower bound on the value of the labeling
number for square grid is computed and a formula is proposed which yields a
$\lambda$-$L(k, k-1, \ldots, 2, 1)$-labeling of square grid, with approximation
ratio at most $\frac{9}{8}$. The labeling presented is a no-hole one, i.e., it
uses each label from $0$ to $\lambda-1$ at least once.

 <dc:description>  Ubiquitous information service converged by different types of heterogeneous
networks is one of fundamental functions for smart cities. Considering the
deployment of 5G ultra-dense wireless networks, the 5G converged cell-less
communication networks are proposed to support mobile terminals in smart
cities. To break obstacles of heterogeneous wireless networks, the 5G converged
cell-less communication network is vertically converged in different tiers of
heterogeneous wireless networks and horizontally converged in celled
architectures of base stations/access points. Moreover, the software defined
network controllers are configured to manage the traffic scheduling and
resource allocation in 5G converged cell-less communication networks.
Simulation results indicate the coverage probability and the energy saving at
both base stations and mobile terminals are improved by the cooperative
grouping scheme in 5G converged cell-less communication networks.

 <dc:title>The Cascading Haar Wavelet algorithm for computing the Walsh-Hadamard
  Transform</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Thompson, Andrew</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a novel algorithm for computing the Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT)
which consists entirely of Haar wavelet transforms. We prove that the
algorithm, which we call the Cascading Haar Wavelet (CHW) algorithm, shares
precisely the same serial complexity as the popular divide-and-conquer
algorithm for the WHT. We also propose a natural way of parallelizing the
algorithm which has a number of attractive features.

 <dc:description>  Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in
artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language
processing. In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep
recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and
machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences
describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the
target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several
datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it
learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which
we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, given the recent
surge of interest in this task, a competition was organized in 2015 using the
newly released COCO dataset. We describe and analyze the various improvements
we applied to our own baseline and show the resulting performance in the
competition, which we won ex-aequo with a team from Microsoft Research, and
provide an open source implementation in TensorFlow.

 <dc:description>  In speech-applications such as text-to-speech (TTS) or automatic speech
recognition (ASR), \emph{text normalization} refers to the task of converting
from a \emph{written} representation into a representation of how the text is
to be \emph{spoken}. In all real-world speech applications, the text
normalization engine is developed---in large part---by hand. For example, a
hand-built grammar may be used to enumerate the possible ways of saying a given
token in a given language, and a statistical model used to select the most
appropriate pronunciation in context. In this study we examine the tradeoffs
associated with using more or less language-specific domain knowledge in a text
normalization engine. In the most data-rich scenario, we have access to a
carefully constructed hand-built normalization grammar that for any given token
will produce a set of all possible verbalizations for that token. We also
assume a corpus of aligned written-spoken utterances, from which we can train a
ranking model that selects the appropriate verbalization for the given context.
As a substitute for the carefully constructed grammar, we also consider a
scenario with a language-universal normalization \emph{covering grammar}, where
the developer merely needs to provide a set of lexical items particular to the
language. As a substitute for the aligned corpus, we also consider a scenario
where one only has the spoken side, and the corresponding written side is
&quot;hallucinated&quot; by composing the spoken side with the inverted normalization
grammar. We investigate the accuracy of a text normalization engine under each
of these scenarios. We report the results of experiments on English and
Russian.

 <dc:description>  We propose a max-min multi-cell aware regularized zero-forcing (Max-Min
MCA-RZF) precoding and power allocation scheme for downlink multi-cell massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. A general correlated channel
model is considered, and the adopted channel state information (CSI)
acquisition model includes the effects of estimation errors and pilot
contamination. We use results from random matrix theory to derive deterministic
equivalents for the proposed Max-Min power allocation in the large system limit
which solely depend on statistical CSI, but not on individual channel
realizations. Our numerical results show that the proposed Max-Min MCA-RZF
precoder achieves a substantially higher network-wide minimum rate than the
MCA-RZF and the conventional RZF precoders with uniform power allocation,
respectively, as well as the conventional RZF precoder with Max-Min power
allocation.

 <dc:description>  Land use mapping is a fundamental yet challenging task in geographic science.
In contrast to land cover mapping, it is generally not possible using overhead
imagery. The recent, explosive growth of online geo-referenced photo
collections suggests an alternate approach to geographic knowledge discovery.
In this work, we present a general framework that uses ground-level images from
Flickr for land use mapping. Our approach benefits from several novel aspects.
First, we address the nosiness of the online photo collections, such as
imprecise geolocation and uneven spatial distribution, by performing location
and indoor/outdoor filtering, and semi- supervised dataset augmentation. Our
indoor/outdoor classifier achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
bench- mark datasets and approaches human-level accuracy. Second, we utilize
high-level semantic image features extracted using deep learning, specifically
convolutional neural net- works, which allow us to achieve upwards of 76%
accuracy on a challenging eight class land use mapping problem.

 <dc:description>  We study Fisher markets and the problem of maximizing the Nash social welfare
(NSW), and show several closely related new results. In particular, we obtain:
  -- A new integer program for the NSW maximization problem whose fractional
relaxation has a bounded integrality gap. In contrast, the natural integer
program has an unbounded integrality gap.
  -- An improved, and tight, factor 2 analysis of the algorithm of [7]; in turn
showing that the integrality gap of the above relaxation is at most 2. The
approximation factor shown by [7] was $2e^{1/e} \approx 2.89$.
  -- A lower bound of $e^{1/e}\approx 1.44$ on the integrality gap of this
relaxation.
  -- New convex programs for natural generalizations of linear Fisher markets
and proofs that these markets admit rational equilibria.
  These results were obtained by establishing connections between previously
known disparate results, and they help uncover their mathematical
underpinnings. We show a formal connection between the convex programs of
Eisenberg and Gale and that of Shmyrev, namely that their duals are equivalent
up to a change of variables. Both programs capture equilibria of linear Fisher
markets. By adding suitable constraints to Shmyrev's program, we obtain a
convex program that captures equilibria of the spending-restricted market model
defined by [7] in the context of the NSW maximization problem. Further, adding
certain integral constraints to this program we get the integer program for the
NSW mentioned above.
  The basic tool we use is convex programming duality. In the special case of
convex programs with linear constraints (but convex objectives), we show a
particularly simple way of obtaining dual programs, putting it almost at par
with linear program duality. This simple way of finding duals has been used
subsequently for many other applications.

 <dc:description>  Visual Question Answering (VQA) task has showcased a new stage of interaction
between language and vision, two of the most pivotal components of artificial
intelligence. However, it has mostly focused on generating short and repetitive
answers, mostly single words, which fall short of rich linguistic capabilities
of humans. We introduce Full-Sentence Visual Question Answering (FSVQA)
dataset, consisting of nearly 1 million pairs of questions and full-sentence
answers for images, built by applying a number of rule-based natural language
processing techniques to original VQA dataset and captions in the MS COCO
dataset. This poses many additional complexities to conventional VQA task, and
we provide a baseline for approaching and evaluating the task, on top of which
we invite the research community to build further improvements.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of computing optimal paths through
three consecutive points for the curvature-constrained forward moving Dubins
vehicle. Given initial and final configurations of the Dubins vehicle, and a
midpoint with an unconstrained heading, the objective is to compute the
midpoint heading that minimizes the total Dubins path length. We provide a
novel geometrical analysis of the optimal path, and establish new properties of
the optimal Dubins' path through three points. We then show how our method can
be used to quickly refine Dubins TSP tours produced using state-of-the-art
techniques. We also provide extensive simulation results showing the
improvement of the proposed approach in both runtime and solution quality over
the conventional method of uniform discretization of the heading at the
mid-point, followed by solving the minimum Dubins path for each discrete
heading.

 <dc:description>  Steganography is the discipline that deals with concealing the existence of
secret communications. Existing research already provided several fundamentals
for defining steganography and presented a multitude of hiding methods and
countermeasures for this research discipline.
  We identified that no work exists that discusses the process of applying
steganography from an individual's perspective. This paper presents a phase
model that explains pre-conditions of applying steganography as well as the
decision-making process and the final termination of a steganographic
communication. The model can be used to explain whether an individual can use
steganography and to explain whether and why an individual desires to use
steganography. Moreover, the model can be used in research publications to
indicate the addressed model's phase of scientific contributions. Furthermore,
our model can be used to teach the process of steganography-application to
students.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a computationally efficient approach to detecting objects
natively in 3D point clouds using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In
particular, this is achieved by leveraging a feature-centric voting scheme to
implement novel convolutional layers which explicitly exploit the sparsity
encountered in the input. To this end, we examine the trade-off between
accuracy and speed for different architectures and additionally propose to use
an L1 penalty on the filter activations to further encourage sparsity in the
intermediate representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to propose sparse convolutional layers and L1 regularisation for efficient
large-scale processing of 3D data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on the KITTI object detection benchmark and show that Vote3Deep models with as
few as three layers outperform the previous state of the art in both laser and
laser-vision based approaches by margins of up to 40% while remaining highly
competitive in terms of processing time.

 <dc:description>  Computed tomography imaging is a standard modality for detecting and
assessing lung cancer. In order to evaluate the malignancy of lung nodules,
clinical practice often involves expert qualitative ratings on several criteria
describing a nodule's appearance and shape. Translating these features for
computer-aided diagnostics is challenging due to their subjective nature and
the difficulties in gaining a complete description. In this paper, we propose a
computerized approach to quantitatively evaluate both appearance distinctions
and 3D surface variations. Nodule shape was modeled and parameterized using
spherical harmonics, and appearance features were extracted using deep
convolutional neural networks. Both sets of features were combined to estimate
the nodule malignancy using a random forest classifier. The proposed algorithm
was tested on the publicly available Lung Image Database Consortium dataset,
achieving high accuracy. By providing lung nodule characterization, this method
can provide a robust alternative reference opinion for lung cancer diagnosis.

 <dc:description>  Purpose: To present a new fast and reliable application for iPad (ST) for
screening stereopsis at multiple distances.
  Methods: A new iPad application (app) based on a random dot stereogram was
designed for screening stereopsis at multiple distances. Sixty-five subjects
with no ocular diseases and wearing their habitual correction were tested at
two different distances: 3 m and at 0.4 m. Results were compared with other
commercial tests: TNO (at near) and Howard Dolman (at distance) Subjects were
cited one week later in order to repeat the same procedures for assessing
reproducibility of the tests.
  Results: Stereopsis at near was better with ST (40 arcsec) than with TNO (60
arcsec), but not significantly (p = 0.36). The agreement was good (k = 0.604)
and the reproducibility was better with ST (k = 0.801) than with TNO (k =
0.715), in fact median difference between days was significant only with TNO (p
= 0.02). On the other hand, poor agreement was obtained between HD and ST at
far distance (k=0.04), obtaining significant differences in medians (p = 0.001)
and poorer reliability with HD (k = 0.374) than with ST (k = 0.502).
  Conclusions: Screening stereopsis at near with a new iPad app demonstrated to
be a fast and realiable. Results were in a good agreement with conventional
tests as TNO, but it could not be compared at far vision with HD due to the
limited resolution of the iPad.

 <dc:title>Seeing is Believing: A Unified Model for Consistency and Isolation via

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a unified model of consistency and isolation that
minimizes the gap between how these guarantees are defined and how they are
perceived. Our approach is premised on a simple observation: applications view
storage systems as black-boxes that transition through a series of states, a
subset of which are observed by applications. For maximum clarity, isolation
and consistency guarantees should be expressed as constraints on those states.
Instead, these properties are currently expressed as constraints on operation
histories that are not visible to the application. We show that adopting a
state-based approach to expressing these guarantees brings forth several
benefits. First, it makes it easier to focus on the anomalies that a given
isolation or consistency level allows (and that applications must deal with),
rather than those that it proscribes. Second, it unifies the often disparate
theories of isolation and consistency and provides a structure for composing
these guarantees. We leverage this modularity to apply to transactions
(independently of the isolation level under which they execute) the equivalence
between causal consistency and session guarantees that Chockler et al. had
proved for single operations. Third, it brings clarity to the increasingly
crowded field of proposed consistency and isolation properties by winnowing
spurious distinctions: we find that the recently proposed parallel snapshot
isolation introduced by Sovran et al. is in fact a specific implementation of
an older guarantee, lazy consistency (or PL-2+), introduced by Adya et al.

 <dc:description>  Anomalous user behavior detection is the core component of many information
security systems, such as intrusion detection, insider threat detection and
authentication systems. Anomalous behavior will raise an alarm to the system
administrator and can be further combined with other information to determine
whether it constitutes an unauthorised or malicious use of a resource. This
paper presents an anomalous user behaviour detection framework that applies an
extended version of Isolation Forest algorithm. Our method is fast and scalable
and does not require example anomalies in the training data set. We apply our
method to an enterprise dataset. The experimental results show that the system
is able to isolate anomalous instances from the baseline user model using a
single feature or combined features.

 <dc:description>  Complex Dynamic Networks can be exploited in solving problems where
traditional solutions may not be sufficient. The increasing complexity of
computer networks imposes problems to the current network management solutions.
In this context, network management is an example of a research area that could
benefit from the use of CDNs. However, the consistency of state of management
data among the elements that build management CDNs (management nodes) is an
important challenge. Traditional mechanisms to maintain consistency of these
states are supported by some centralization which wastes some desirable
properties of CDNs (e.g., robustness). In contrast to these mechanisms, we
propose a distributed, scalable and robust mechanism to maintain the
consistency of state of management data in management CDNs. Our mechanism
introduces multi-agent truth maintenance features and communication strategies
based on dynamic process to provide consistency maintenance of state of
management data. We developed a model of a management CDN on Peersim simulator
to perform experiments. Besides, 2 case studies are presented. The result
obtained supports our scalability and robustness claims.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated superior capability
for extracting information from raw signals in computer vision. Recently,
character-level and multi-channel CNNs have exhibited excellent performance for
sentence classification tasks. We apply CNNs to large-scale authorship
attribution, which aims to determine an unknown text's author among many
candidate authors, motivated by their ability to process character-level
signals and to differentiate between a large number of classes, while making
fast predictions in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. We extensively
evaluate CNN-based approaches that leverage word and character channels and
compare them against state-of-the-art methods for a large range of author
numbers, shedding new light on traditional approaches. We show that
character-level CNNs outperform the state-of-the-art on four out of five
datasets in different domains. Additionally, we present the first application
of authorship attribution to reddit.

 <dc:title>SoftTarget Regularization: An Effective Technique to Reduce Over-Fitting
  in Neural Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Aghajanyan, Armen</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks are learning models with a very high capacity and
therefore prone to over-fitting. Many regularization techniques such as
Dropout, DropConnect, and weight decay all attempt to solve the problem of
over-fitting by reducing the capacity of their respective models (Srivastava et
al., 2014), (Wan et al., 2013), (Krogh &amp; Hertz, 1992). In this paper we
introduce a new form of regularization that guides the learning problem in a
way that reduces over-fitting without sacrificing the capacity of the model.
The mistakes that models make in early stages of training carry information
about the learning problem. By adjusting the labels of the current epoch of
training through a weighted average of the real labels, and an exponential
average of the past soft-targets we achieved a regularization scheme as
powerful as Dropout without necessarily reducing the capacity of the model, and
simplified the complexity of the learning problem. SoftTarget regularization
proved to be an effective tool in various neural network architectures.

 <dc:description>  We explore architectures for general pixel-level prediction problems, from
low-level edge detection to mid-level surface normal estimation to high-level
semantic segmentation. Convolutional predictors, such as the
fully-convolutional network (FCN), have achieved remarkable success by
exploiting the spatial redundancy of neighboring pixels through convolutional
processing. Though computationally efficient, we point out that such approaches
are not statistically efficient during learning precisely because spatial
redundancy limits the information learned from neighboring pixels. We
demonstrate that (1) stratified sampling allows us to add diversity during
batch updates and (2) sampled multi-scale features allow us to explore more
nonlinear predictors (multiple fully-connected layers followed by ReLU) that
improve overall accuracy. Finally, our objective is to show how a architecture
can get performance better than (or comparable to) the architectures designed
for a particular task. Interestingly, our single architecture produces
state-of-the-art results for semantic segmentation on PASCAL-Context, surface
normal estimation on NYUDv2 dataset, and edge detection on BSDS without
contextual post-processing.

reasons and for potential applications to cryptography. In this paper, we use

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the use of variable speed limits for resilient
operation of transportation networks, which are modeled as dynamical flow
networks under local routing decisions. In such systems, some external inflow
is injected to the so-called origin nodes of the network. The total inflow
arriving at each node is routed to its operational outgoing links based on
their current particle densities. The density on each link has first order
dynamics driven by the difference of its incoming and outgoing flows. A link
irreversibly fails if it reaches its jam density. Such failures may propagate
in the network and cause a systemic failure. We show that larger link
capacities do not necessarily help in preventing systemic failures under local
routing. Accordingly, we propose the use of variable speed limits to operate
the links below their capacities, when necessary, to compensate for the lack of
global information and coordination in routing decisions. Our main result shows
that systemic failures under feasible external inflows can always be averted
through a proper selection of speed limits if the routing decisions are
sufficiently responsive to local congestion and the network is initially
uncongested. This is an attractive feature as it is much easier in practice to
adjust the speed limits than to build more physical capacity or to alter
routing decisions that are determined by social behavior.

 <dc:description>  Distribution testing deals with what information can be deduced about an
unknown distribution over $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, where the algorithm is only allowed
to obtain a relatively small number of independent samples from the
distribution. In the extended conditional sampling model, the algorithm is also
allowed to obtain samples from the restriction of the original distribution on
subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
  In 2015, Canonne, Diakonikolas, Gouleakis and Rubinfeld unified several
previous results, and showed that for any property of distributions satisfying
a &quot;decomposability&quot; criterion, there exists an algorithm (in the basic model)
that can distinguish with high probability distributions satisfying the
property from distributions that are far from it in the variation distance.
  We present here a more efficient yet simpler algorithm for the basic model,
as well as very efficient algorithms for the conditional model, which until now
was not investigated under the umbrella of decomposable properties.
Additionally, we provide an algorithm for the conditional model that handles a
much larger class of properties.
  Our core mechanism is a way of efficiently producing an interval-partition of
$\{1,\ldots,n\}$ that satisfies a &quot;fine-grain&quot; quality. We show that with such
a partition at hand we can directly move forward with testing individual
intervals, instead of first searching for the &quot;correct&quot; partition of
$\{1,\ldots,n\}$.

 <dc:description>  Proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers are important and widely
used tools in system control. Tuning of the controller gains is a laborious
task, especially for complex systems such as combustion engines. To minimize
the time of an engineer for tuning of the gains in a simulation software, we
propose to formulate a part of the problem as a black-box optimization task. In
this paper, we summarize the properties and practical limitations of tuning of
the gains in this particular application. We investigate the latest methods of
black-box optimization and conclude that the Covariance Matrix Adaptation
Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) with bi-population restart strategy, elitist parent
selection and active covariance matrix adaptation is best suited for this task.
Details of the algorithm's experiment-based calibration are explained as well
as derivation of a suitable objective function. The method's performance is
compared with that of PSO and SHADE. Finally, its usability is verified on six
models of real engines.

 <dc:description>  Let $G$ be a graph embedded in a fixed surface $\Sigma$ of genus $g$ and let
$L=(L(v):v\in V(G))$ be a collection of lists such that either each list has
size at least five, or each list has size at least four and $G$ is
triangle-free, or each list has size at least three and $G$ has no cycle of
length four or less. An $L$-coloring of $G$ is a mapping $\phi$ with domain
$V(G)$ such that $\phi(v)\in L(v)$ for every $v\in V(G)$ and
$\phi(v)\ne\phi(u)$ for every pair of adjacent vertices $u,v\in V(G)$. We prove
  * if every non-null-homotopic cycle in $G$ has length $\Omega(\log g)$, then
$G$ has an $L$-coloring,
  * if $G$ does not have an $L$-coloring, but every proper subgraph does
(&quot;$L$-critical graph&quot;), then $|V(G)|=O(g)$,
  * if every non-null-homotopic cycle in $G$ has length $\Omega(g)$, and a set
$X\subseteq V(G)$ of vertices that are pairwise at distance $\Omega(1)$ is
precolored from the corresponding lists, then the precoloring extends to an
$L$-coloring of $G$,
  * if every non-null-homotopic cycle in $G$ has length $\Omega(g)$, and the
graph $G$ is allowed to have crossings, but every two crossings are at distance
$\Omega(1)$, then $G$ has an $L$-coloring, and
  * if $G$ has at least one $L$-coloring, then it has at least
$2^{\Omega(|V(G)|)}$ distinct $L$-colorings.
  We show that the above assertions are consequences of certain isoperimetric
inequalities satisfied by $L$-critical graphs, and we study the structure of
families of embedded graphs that satisfy those inequalities. It follows that
the above assertions hold for other coloring problems, as long as the
corresponding critical graphs satisfy the same inequalities.

 <dc:description>  Hashing produces compact representations for documents, to perform tasks like
classification or retrieval based on these short codes. When hashing is
supervised, the codes are trained using labels on the training data. This paper
first shows that the evaluation protocols used in the literature for supervised
hashing are not satisfactory: we show that a trivial solution that encodes the
output of a classifier significantly outperforms existing supervised or
semi-supervised methods, while using much shorter codes. We then propose two
alternative protocols for supervised hashing: one based on retrieval on a
disjoint set of classes, and another based on transfer learning to new classes.
We provide two baseline methods for image-related tasks to assess the
performance of (semi-)supervised hashing: without coding and with unsupervised
codes. These baselines give a lower- and upper-bound on the performance of a
supervised hashing scheme.

 <dc:description>  Because most technology and computer architecture innovations were
(intentionally) invisible to higher layers, application and other software
developers could reap the benefits of this progress without engaging in it.
Higher performance has both made more computationally demanding applications
feasible (e.g., virtual assistants, computer vision) and made less demanding
applications easier to develop by enabling higher-level programming
abstractions (e.g., scripting languages and reusable components). Improvements
in computer system cost-effectiveness enabled value creation that could never
have been imagined by the field's founders (e.g., distributed web search
sufficiently inexpensive so as to be covered by advertising links).
  The wide benefits of computer performance growth are clear. Recently,
Danowitz et al. apportioned computer performance growth roughly equally between
technology and architecture, with architecture credited with ~80x improvement
since 1985. As semiconductor technology approaches its &quot;end-of-the-road&quot; (see
below), computer architecture will need to play an increasing role in enabling
future ICT innovation. But instead of asking, &quot;How can I make my chip run
faster?,&quot; architects must now ask, &quot;How can I enable the 21st century
infrastructure, from sensors to clouds, adding value from performance to
privacy, but without the benefit of near-perfect technology scaling?&quot;. The
challenges are many, but with appropriate investment, opportunities abound.
Underlying these opportunities is a common theme that future architecture
innovations will require the engagement of and investments from innovators in
other ICT layers.

 <dc:title>Quickest Change Detection Approach to Optimal Control in Markov Decision

 <dc:description>  Optimal control in non-stationary Markov decision processes (MDP) is a
challenging problem. The aim in such a control problem is to maximize the
long-term discounted reward when the transition dynamics or the reward function
can change over time. When a prior knowledge of change statistics is available,
the standard Bayesian approach to this problem is to reformulate it as a
partially observable MDP (POMDP) and solve it using approximate POMDP solvers,
which are typically computationally demanding. In this paper, the problem is
analyzed through the viewpoint of quickest change detection (QCD), a set of
tools for detecting a change in the distribution of a sequence of random
variables. Current methods applying QCD to such problems only passively detect
changes by following prescribed policies, without optimizing the choice of
actions for long term performance. We demonstrate that ignoring the
reward-detection trade-off can cause a significant loss in long term rewards,
and propose a two threshold switching strategy to solve the issue. A
non-Bayesian problem formulation is also proposed for scenarios where a
Bayesian formulation cannot be defined. The performance of the proposed two
threshold strategy is examined through numerical analysis on a non-stationary
MDP task, and the strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art QCD methods in both
Bayesian and non-Bayesian settings.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of writing an arbitrary symmetric matrix as the
difference of two positive semidefinite matrices. We start with simple ideas
such as eigenvalue decomposition. Then, we develop a simple adaptation of the
Cholesky that returns a difference-of-Cholesky representation of indefinite
matrices. Heuristics that promote sparsity can be applied directly to this
modification.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Control Strategy for Constant Optical Flow Divergence Landing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Bio-inspired methods can provide efficient solutions to perform autonomous
landing for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). Flying insects such as honeybees perform
vertical landings by keeping flow divergence constant. This leads to an
exponential decay of both height and vertical velocity, and allows for smooth
and safe landings. However, the presence of noise and delay in obtaining flow
divergence estimates will cause instability of the landing when the control
gains are not adapted to the height. In this paper, we propose a strategy that
deals with this fundamental problem of optical flow control. The key to the
strategy lies in the use of a recent theory that allows the MAV to see distance
by means of its control instability. At the start of a landing, the MAV detects
the height by means of an oscillating movement and sets the control gains
accordingly. Then, during descent, the gains are reduced exponentially, with
mechanisms in place to reduce or increase the gains if the actual trajectory
deviates too much from an ideal constant divergence landing. Real-world
experiments demonstrate stable landings of the MAV in both indoor and windy
outdoor environments.

 <dc:title>Simulation of the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol in OMNeT++</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wallner, Wolfgang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Real-time systems rely on a distributed global time base. As any physical
clock device suffers from noise, it is necessary to provide some kind of clock
synchronization to establish such a global time base. Different clock
synchronization methods have been invented for individual application domains.
The Precision Time Protocol (PTP), which is specified in IEEE 1588, is another
interesting option. It targets local networks, where it is acceptable to assume
small amounts of hardware support, and promises sub-microsecond precision. PTP
provides many different implementation and configuration options, and thus the
Design Space Exploration (DSE) is challenging. In this paper we discuss the
implementation of realistic clock noise and its synchronization via PTP in
OMNeT++. The components presented in this paper are intended to assist
engineers with the configuration of PTP networks.

 <dc:description>  We perform spatio-temporal analysis of public sentiment using geotagged photo
collections. We develop a deep learning-based classifier that predicts the
emotion conveyed by an image. This allows us to associate sentiment with place.
We perform spatial hotspot detection and show that different emotions have
distinct spatial distributions that match expectations. We also perform
temporal analysis using the capture time of the photos. Our spatio-temporal
hotspot detection correctly identifies emerging concentrations of specific
emotions and year-by-year analyses of select locations show there are strong
temporal correlations between the predicted emotions and known events.

 <dc:title>Joint CTC-Attention based End-to-End Speech Recognition using Multi-task

 <dc:description>  Recently, there has been an increasing interest in end-to-end speech
recognition that directly transcribes speech to text without any predefined
alignments. One approach is the attention-based encoder-decoder framework that
learns a mapping between variable-length input and output sequences in one step
using a purely data-driven method. The attention model has often been shown to
improve the performance over another end-to-end approach, the Connectionist
Temporal Classification (CTC), mainly because it explicitly uses the history of
the target character without any conditional independence assumptions. However,
we observed that the performance of the attention has shown poor results in
noisy condition and is hard to learn in the initial training stage with long
input sequences. This is because the attention model is too flexible to predict
proper alignments in such cases due to the lack of left-to-right constraints as
used in CTC. This paper presents a novel method for end-to-end speech
recognition to improve robustness and achieve fast convergence by using a joint
CTC-attention model within the multi-task learning framework, thereby
mitigating the alignment issue. An experiment on the WSJ and CHiME-4 tasks
demonstrates its advantages over both the CTC and attention-based
encoder-decoder baselines, showing 5.4-14.6% relative improvements in Character
Error Rate (CER).

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel unifying scheme for parallel implementation of articulated
robot dynamics algorithms. It is based on a unified Lie group notation for
deriving the equations of motion of articulated robots, where various
well-known forward algorithms differ only by their joint inertia matrix
inversion strategies. This new scheme leads to a unified abstraction of
state-of-the-art forward dynamics algorithms into combinations of block
bi-diagonal and/or block tri-diagonal systems, which may be efficiently solved
by parallel all-prefix-sum operations (scan) and parallel odd-even elimination
(OEE) respectively. We implement the proposed scheme on a Nvidia CUDA GPU
platform for the comparative study of three algorithms, namely the hybrid
articulated-body inertia algorithm (ABIA), the parallel joint space inertia
inversion algorithm (JSIIA) and the constrained force algorithm (CFA), and the
performances are analyzed.

becoming an indispensable part of today's big data. In this paper, we focus on
reviewing two lines of research aiming to stimulate the comprehension of videos
with deep learning: video classification and video captioning. While video
classification concentrates on automatically labeling video clips based on
their semantic contents like human actions or complex events, video captioning
attempts to generate a complete and natural sentence, enriching the single
label as in video classification, to capture the most informative dynamics in
videos. In addition, we also provide a review of popular benchmarks and

 <dc:description>  The Dirichlet process and its extension, the Pitman-Yor process, are
stochastic processes that take probability distributions as a parameter. These
processes can be stacked up to form a hierarchical nonparametric Bayesian
model. In this article, we present efficient methods for the use of these
processes in this hierarchical context, and apply them to latent variable
models for text analytics. In particular, we propose a general framework for
designing these Bayesian models, which are called topic models in the computer
science community. We then propose a specific nonparametric Bayesian topic
model for modelling text from social media. We focus on tweets (posts on
Twitter) in this article due to their ease of access. We find that our
nonparametric model performs better than existing parametric models in both
goodness of fit and real world applications.

 <dc:description>  Twitter data is extremely noisy -- each tweet is short, unstructured and with
informal language, a challenge for current topic modeling. On the other hand,
tweets are accompanied by extra information such as authorship, hashtags and
the user-follower network. Exploiting this additional information, we propose
the Twitter-Network (TN) topic model to jointly model the text and the social
network in a full Bayesian nonparametric way. The TN topic model employs the
hierarchical Poisson-Dirichlet processes (PDP) for text modeling and a Gaussian
process random function model for social network modeling. We show that the TN
topic model significantly outperforms several existing nonparametric models due
to its flexibility. Moreover, the TN topic model enables additional informative
inference such as authors' interests, hashtag analysis, as well as leading to
further applications such as author recommendation, automatic topic labeling
and hashtag suggestion. Note our general inference framework can readily be
applied to other topic models with embedded PDP nodes.

 <dc:description>  We are experiencing an explosion in the amount of sensors measuring our
activities and the world around us. These sensors are spread throughout the
built environment and can help us perform state estimation and control of
related systems, but they are often built and/or maintained by third parties or
system users. As a result, by outsourcing system measurement to third parties,
the controller must accept their measurements without being able to directly
verify the sensors' correct operation. Instead, detection and rejection of
measurements from faulty sensors must be done with the raw data only. Towards
this goal, we present a method of detecting possibly faulty behavior of
sensors. The method does not require that the control designer have any model
of faulty sensor behavior. As we discuss, it turns out that the widely-used
particle filter state estimation algorithm provides the ingredients necessary
for a hypothesis test against all ranges of correct operating behavior,
obviating the need for a fault model to compare measurements. We demonstrate
the applicability of our method by demonstrating its ability to reject faulty
measurements and improve state estimation accuracy in a nonlinear vehicle
traffic model without information of generated faulty measurements'
characteristics. In our test, we correctly identify nearly 90% of measurements
as faulty or non-faulty without having any fault model. This leads to only a 3%
increase in state estimation error over a theoretical 100%-accurate fault
detector.

 <dc:description>  In the era of big data, optimizing large scale machine learning problems
becomes a challenging task and draws significant attention. Asynchronous
optimization algorithms come out as a promising solution. Recently, decoupled
asynchronous proximal stochastic gradient descent (DAP-SGD) is proposed to
minimize a composite function. It is claimed to be able to off-loads the
computation bottleneck from server to workers by allowing workers to evaluate
the proximal operators, therefore, server just need to do element-wise
operations. However, it still suffers from slow convergence rate because of the
variance of stochastic gradient is nonzero. In this paper, we propose a faster
method, decoupled asynchronous proximal stochastic variance reduced gradient
descent method (DAP-SVRG). We prove that our method has linear convergence for
strongly convex problem. Large-scale experiments are also conducted in this
paper, and results demonstrate our theoretical analysis.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops a control approach with correctness guarantees for the
simultaneous operation of lane keeping and adaptive cruise control. The safety
specifications for these driver assistance modules are expressed in terms of
set invariance. Control barrier functions are used to design a family of
control solutions that guarantee the forward invariance of a set, which implies
satisfaction of the safety specifications. The control barrier functions are
synthesized through a combination of sum-of-squares program and physics-based
modeling and optimization. A real-time quadratic program is posed to combine
the control barrier functions with the performance-based controllers, which can
be either expressed as control Lyapunov function conditions or as black-box
legacy controllers. In both cases, the resulting feedback control guarantees
the safety of the composed driver assistance modules in a formally correct
manner. Importantly, the quadratic program admits a closed-form solution that
can be easily implemented. The effectiveness of the control approach is
demonstrated by simulations in the industry-standard vehicle simulator Carsim.

 <dc:description>  We present a network influence game that models players strategically seeding
the opinions of nodes embedded in a social network. A social learning dynamic,
whereby nodes repeatedly update their opinions to resemble those of their
neighbors, spreads the seeded opinions through the network. After a fixed
period of time, the dynamic halts and each player's utility is determined by
the relative strength of the opinions held by each node in the network
vis-a-vis the other players. We show that the existence of a pure Nash
equilibrium cannot be guaranteed in general. However, if the dynamics are
allowed to progress for a sufficient amount of time so that a consensus among
all of the nodes is obtained, then the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium can
be guaranteed. The computational complexity of finding a pure strategy best
response is shown to be NP-complete, but can be efficiently approximated to
within a (1 - 1/e) factor of optimal by a simple greedy algorithm.

 <dc:title>Algorithmic Persuasion with No Externalities</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the algorithmics of information structure design -- a.k.a.
persuasion or signaling -- in a fundamental special case introduced by Arieli
and Babichenko: multiple agents, binary actions, and no inter-agent
externalities. Unlike prior work on this model, we allow many states of nature.
We assume that the principal's objective is a monotone set function, and study
the problem both in the public signal and private signal models, drawing a
sharp contrast between the two in terms of both efficacy and computational
complexity.
  When private signals are allowed, our results are largely positive and quite
general. First, we show polynomial-time equivalence between optimal signaling
and the problem of maximizing the objective function plus an additive function.
This yields an efficient implementation of the optimal scheme when the
objective is supermodular or anonymous. Second, we exhibit a
(1-1/e)-approximation of the optimal private signaling scheme, modulo an
additive loss of $\epsilon$, when the objective function is submodular. These
two results simplify, unify, and generalize results of [Arieli and Babichenko,
2016] and [Babichenko and Barman, 2016], extending them from a binary state of
nature to many states (modulo the additive loss in the latter result). Third,
we consider the binary-state case with a submodular objective, and simplify and
slightly strengthen the result of [Babichenko and Barman, 2016] to obtain a
(1-1/e)-approximation via an explicitly constructed scheme.
  When only a public signal is allowed, our results are negative. First, we
show that it is NP-hard to approximate the optimal public scheme, within any
constant factor, even when the objective is additive. Second, we show that the
optimal private scheme can outperform the optimal public scheme, in terms of
maximizing the sender's objective, by a polynomial factor.

 <dc:description>  Bibliographic analysis considers author's research areas, the citation
network and paper content among other things. In this paper, we combine these
three in a topic model that produces a bibliographic model of authors, topics
and documents using a non-parametric extension of a combination of the Poisson
mixed-topic link model and the author-topic model. We propose a novel and
efficient inference algorithm for the model to explore subsets of research
publications from CiteSeerX. Our model demonstrates improved performance in
both model fitting and a clustering task compared to several baselines.

 <dc:description>  We propose an extension to Hawkes processes by treating the levels of
self-excitation as a stochastic differential equation. Our new point process
allows better approximation in application domains where events and intensities
accelerate each other with correlated levels of contagion. We generalize a
recent algorithm for simulating draws from Hawkes processes whose levels of
excitation are stochastic processes, and propose a hybrid Markov chain Monte
Carlo approach for model fitting. Our sampling procedure scales linearly with
the number of required events and does not require stationarity of the point
process. A modular inference procedure consisting of a combination between
Gibbs and Metropolis Hastings steps is put forward. We recover expectation
maximization as a special case. Our general approach is illustrated for
contagion following geometric Brownian motion and exponential Langevin
dynamics.

 <dc:description>  High-speed, low-latency obstacle avoidance that is insensitive to sensor
noise is essential for enabling multiple decentralized robots to function
reliably in cluttered and dynamic environments. While other distributed
multi-agent collision avoidance systems exist, these systems require online
geometric optimization where tedious parameter tuning and perfect sensing are
necessary.
  We present a novel end-to-end framework to generate reactive collision
avoidance policy for efficient distributed multi-agent navigation. Our method
formulates an agent's navigation strategy as a deep neural network mapping from
the observed noisy sensor measurements to the agent's steering commands in
terms of movement velocity. We train the network on a large number of frames of
collision avoidance data collected by repeatedly running a multi-agent
simulator with different parameter settings. We validate the learned deep
neural network policy in a set of simulated and real scenarios with noisy
measurements and demonstrate that our method is able to generate a robust
navigation strategy that is insensitive to imperfect sensing and works reliably
in all situations. We also show that our method can be well generalized to
scenarios that do not appear in our training data, including scenes with static
obstacles and agents with different sizes. Videos are available at

 <dc:description>  Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are an important concept in random
matrix theory and combinatorics. They have also recently attracted interest in
the study of numerical methods for machine learning, as they offer an elegant
&quot;missing link&quot; between independent Monte Carlo sampling and deterministic
evaluation on regular grids, applicable to a general set of spaces. This is
helpful whenever an algorithm *explores* to reduce uncertainty, such as in
active learning, Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning, and
marginalization in graphical models. To draw samples from a DPP in practice,
existing literature focuses on approximate schemes of low cost, or comparably
inefficient exact algorithms like rejection sampling. We point out that, for
many settings of relevance to machine learning, it is also possible to draw
*exact* samples from DPPs on continuous domains. We start from an intuitive
example on the real line, which is then generalized to multivariate real vector
spaces. We also compare to previously studied approximations, showing that
exact sampling, despite higher cost, can be preferable where precision is
needed.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the novel routing algorithm PSVR for pub/sub systems in
ad-hoc networks. Its focus is on scenarios where communications links are
unstable and nodes frequently change subscriptions. PSVR presents a compromise
of size and maintenance effort for routing tables due to sub- and
unsubscriptions and the length of routing paths. Designed in a self-stabilizing
manner it scales well with network size. The evaluation reveals that PSVR only
needs slightly more messages than a close to optimal routing structure for
publication delivery, and creates shorter routing paths than an existing
self-stabilizing algorithm. A real world deployment shows the usability of the
approach

 <dc:title>Posted Pricing sans Discrimination</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sekar, Shreyas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the quest for market mechanisms that are easy to implement, yet close to
optimal, few seem as viable as posted pricing. Despite the growing body of
impressive results, the performance of most posted price mechanisms however,
rely crucially on price discrimination when multiple copies of a good are
available. For the more general case with non-linear production costs on each
good, hardly anything is known for general multi-good markets. With this in
mind, we study a Bayesian setting where the seller can produce any number of
copies of a good but faces convex production costs for the same, and buyers
arrive sequentially. Our main contribution is a framework for
non-discriminatory pricing in the presence of production costs: the framework
yields posted price mechanisms with O(1)-approximation factors for fractionally
subadditive (XoS) buyers, logarithmic approximations for subadditive buyers,
and also extends to settings where the seller is oblivious to buyer valuations.
Our work presents the first known results for Bayesian settings with production
costs and is among the few posted price mechanisms that do not charge buyers
differently for the same good.

 <dc:description>  As computer vision before, remote sensing has been radically changed by the
introduction of Convolution Neural Networks. Land cover use, object detection
and scene understanding in aerial images rely more and more on deep learning to
achieve new state-of-the-art results. Recent architectures such as Fully
Convolutional Networks (Long et al., 2015) can even produce pixel level
annotations for semantic mapping. In this work, we show how to use such deep
networks to detect, segment and classify different varieties of wheeled
vehicles in aerial images from the ISPRS Potsdam dataset. This allows us to
tackle object detection and classification on a complex dataset made up of
visually similar classes, and to demonstrate the relevance of such a subclass
modeling approach. Especially, we want to show that deep learning is also
suitable for object-oriented analysis of Earth Observation data. First, we
train a FCN variant on the ISPRS Potsdam dataset and show how the learnt
semantic maps can be used to extract precise segmentation of vehicles, which
allow us studying the repartition of vehicles in the city. Second, we train a
CNN to perform vehicle classification on the VEDAI (Razakarivony and Jurie,
2016) dataset, and transfer its knowledge to classify candidate segmented
vehicles on the Potsdam dataset.

DFCNN from generic everyday images to remote sensing images; 2) we introduce a
multi-kernel convolutional layer for fast aggregation of predictions at
multiple scales; 3) we perform data fusion from heterogeneous sensors (optical
and laser) using residual correction. Our framework improves state-of-the-art
accuracy on the ISPRS Vaihingen 2D Semantic Labeling dataset.

 <dc:description>  We present an original concept for patch generation in production. Our idea
is to generate patches on-the-fly based on automated failure oracles (such as
exceptions), and then to perform live regression testing in production. The
latter is achieved by feeding a sandboxed version of the application with a
copy of the production traffic, the 'shadow traffic'.

 <dc:title>Slowly synchronizing automata with fixed alphabet size</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  It was conjectured by \v{C}ern\'y in 1964 that a synchronizing DFA on $n$
states always has a shortest synchronizing word of length at most $(n-1)^2$,
and he gave a sequence of DFAs for which this bound is reached.
  In this paper, we investigate the role of the alphabet size. For each
possible alphabet size, we count DFAs on $n \le 6$ states which synchronize in
$(n-1)^2 - e$ steps, for all $e &lt; 2\lceil n/2 \rceil$. Furthermore, we give
constructions of automata with any number of states, and $3$, $4$, or $5$
symbols, which synchronize slowly, namely in $n^2 - 3n + O(1)$ steps.
  In addition, our results prove \v{C}ern\'y's conjecture for $n \le 6$. Our
computation has led to $27$ DFAs on $3$, $4$, $5$ or $6$ states, which
synchronize in $(n-1)^2$ steps, but do not belong to \v{C}ern\'y's sequence. Of
these $27$ DFA's, $19$ are new, and the remaining $8$ which were already known
are exactly the \emph{minimal} ones: they will not synchronize any more after
removing a symbol.
  So the $19$ new DFAs are extensions of automata which were already known,
including the \v{C}ern\'y automaton on $3$ states. But for $n &gt; 3$, we prove
that the \v{C}ern\'y automaton on $n$ states does not admit non-trivial
extensions with the same smallest synchronizing word length $(n-1)^2$.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the impact of segmentation algorithms as a
preprocessing step for classification of remote sensing images in a deep
learning framework. Especially, we address the issue of segmenting the image
into regions to be classified using pre-trained deep neural networks as feature
extractors for an SVM-based classifier. An efficient segmentation as a
preprocessing step helps learning by adding a spatially-coherent structure to
the data. Therefore, we compare algorithms producing superpixels with more
traditional remote sensing segmentation algorithms and measure the variation in
terms of classification accuracy. We establish that superpixel algorithms allow
for a better classification accuracy as a homogenous and compact segmentation
favors better generalization of the training samples.

 <dc:title>Total Order Reliable Convergecast in WBAN</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bu, Gewu</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper is the first extensive work on total order reliable convergecast
in multi-hop Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). Convergecast is a many-to-one
cooperative scheme where each node of the network transmits data towards the
same sink. Our contribution is threefold. First, we stress existing WBAN
convergecast strategies with respect to their capacity to be reliable and to
ensure the total order delivery at sink. That is, packets sent in a specific
order should be received in the same order by the sink. When stressed with
transmission rates up to 500 packets per second the performances of these
strategies decrease dramatically (more than 90% of packets lost). Secondly, we
propose a new posture-centric model for WBAN. This model offers a good
characterization of the path availability which is further used to fine tune
the retransmission rate thresholds. Third, based on our model we propose a new
mechanism for reliability and a new converge-cast strategy that outperforms
WBAN dedicated strategies but also strategies adapted from DTN and WSN areas.
Our extensive performance evaluations use essential parameters for WBAN: packet
lost, total order reliability (messages sent in a specific order should be
delivered in that specific order) and various human body postures. In
particular, our strategy ensures zero packet order inversions for various
transmission rates and mobility postures. Interestingly, our strategy respects
this property without the need of additional energy-guzzler mechanisms.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an analysis of technical debt management through
resources allocation policies in software maintenance process during its
operation to demonstrate how different strategies leads to the emergence of
different behaviors along the evolution path. To achieve this objective, this
work used the System Dynamic approach for building a computational simulation
model based on extensive literature review and secondary data. Most of the
works that applied the System Dynamics on software projects research, focused
on initial phases of its life cycle, leaving a gap to be explored regarding the
long-term behaviors of the operation and maintenance phases. The results
demonstrated that the excessive focus on the perfective maintenance activities
could be more costly than performing regular preventive maintenance to reduce
the technical debt incurred, ending up with fewer functionalities deployed,
higher backlog, lower productivity, lower maintainability and higher technical
principal.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a theoretical analysis and practical evaluation of the
main bottlenecks towards a scalable distributed solution for the training of
Deep Neuronal Networks (DNNs). The presented results show, that the current
state of the art approach, using data-parallelized Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD), is quickly turning into a vastly communication bound problem. In
addition, we present simple but fixed theoretic constraints, preventing
effective scaling of DNN training beyond only a few dozen nodes. This leads to
poor scalability of DNN training in most practical scenarios.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the basic question of whether a given channel $V$ can be
dominated (in the precise sense of being more noisy) by a $q$-ary symmetric
channel. The concept of &quot;less noisy&quot; relation between channels originated in
network information theory (broadcast channels) and is defined in terms of
mutual information or Kullback-Leibler divergence. We provide an equivalent
characterization in terms of $\chi^2$-divergence. Furthermore, we develop a
simple criterion for domination by a $q$-ary symmetric channel in terms of the
minimum entry of the stochastic matrix defining the channel $V$. The criterion
is strengthened for the special case of additive noise channels over finite
Abelian groups. Finally, it is shown that domination by a symmetric channel
implies (via comparison of Dirichlet forms) a logarithmic Sobolev inequality
for the original channel.

 <dc:description>  Studying network robustness for wireless sensor networks(WSNs) is an exciting
topic of research as sensor nodes often fail due to hardware degradation,
resource constraints, and environmental changes. The application of spectral
graph theory to networked systems has generated several important results.
However, previous research has often failed to consider the network parameters,
which is crucial to study the real network applications. Network criticality is
one of the effective metrics to quantify the network robustness against such
failures and attacks. In this work, we derive the exact formulas of network
criticality for WSNs using r-nearest neighbor networks and we show the effect
of nearest neighbors and network dimension on robustness using analytical and
numerical evaluations. Furthermore, we also show how symmetric and static
approximations can wrongly designate the network robustness when implemented to
WSNs.

 <dc:description>  Visual grouping is a key mechanism in human scene perception. There, it
belongs to the subconscious, early processing and is key prerequisite for other
high level tasks such as recognition. In this paper, we introduce an efficient,
realtime capable algorithm which likewise agglomerates a valuable hierarchical
clustering of a scene, while using purely local appearance statistics. To speed
up the processing, first we subdivide the image into meaningful, atomic
segments using a fast Watershed transform. Starting from there, our rapid,
agglomerative clustering algorithm prunes and maintains the connectivity graph
between clusters to contain only such pairs, which directly touch in the image
domain and are reciprocal nearest neighbors (RNN) wrt. a distance metric. The
core of this approach is our novel cluster distance: it combines boundary and
surface statistics both in terms of appearance as well as spatial linkage. This
yields state-of-the-art performance, as we demonstrate in conclusive
experiments conducted on BSDS500 and Pascal-Context datasets.

 <dc:title>A quantitative analysis of tilt in the Caf\'e Wall illusion: a

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The biological characteristics of human visual processing can be investigated
through the study of optical illusions and their perception, giving rise to
intuitions that may improve computer vision to match human performance.
Geometric illusions are a specific subfamily in which orientations and angles
are misperceived. This paper reports quantifiable predictions of the degree of
tilt for a typical geometric illusion called Caf\'e Wall, in which the mortar
between the tiles seems to tilt or bow. Our study employs a common bioplausible
model of retinal processing and we further develop an analytic processing
pipeline to quantify and thus predict the specific angle of tilt. We further
study the effect of resolution and feature size in order to predict the
different perceived tilts in different areas of the fovea and periphery, where
resolution varies as the eye saccades to different parts of the image. In the
experiments, several different minimal portions of the pattern, modeling
monocular and binocular foveal views, are investigated across multiple scales,
in order to quantify tilts with confidence intervals and explore the difference
between local and global tilt.

 <dc:description>  The current work addresses quantum machine learning in the context of Quantum
Artificial Neural Networks such that the networks' processing is divided in two
stages: the learning stage, where the network converges to a specific quantum
circuit, and the backpropagation stage where the network effectively works as a
self-programing quantum computing system that selects the quantum circuits to
solve computing problems. The results are extended to general architectures
including recurrent networks that interact with an environment, coupling with
it in the neural links' activation order, and self-organizing in a dynamical
regime that intermixes patterns of dynamical stochasticity and persistent
quasiperiodic dynamics, making emerge a form of noise resilient dynamical
record.

 <dc:description>  MoCap-based human identification, as a pattern recognition discipline, can be
optimized using a machine learning approach. Yet in some applications such as
video surveillance new identities can appear on the fly and labeled data for
all encountered people may not always be available. This work introduces the
concept of learning walker-independent gait features directly from raw joint
coordinates by a modification of the Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis with
Maximum Margin Criterion. Our new approach shows not only that these features
can discriminate different people than who they are learned on, but also that
the number of learning identities can be much smaller than the number of
walkers encountered in the real operation.

 <dc:description>  Independent component analysis (ICA) is a method for recovering statistically
independent signals from observations of unknown linear combinations of the
sources. Some of the most accurate ICA decomposition methods require searching
for the inverse transformation which minimizes different approximations of the
Mutual Information, a measure of statistical independence of random vectors.
Two such approximations are the Kernel Generalized Variance or the Kernel
Canonical Correlation which has been shown to reach the highest performance of
ICA methods. However, the computational effort necessary just for computing
these measures is cubic in the sample size. Hence, optimizing them becomes even
more computationally demanding, in terms of both space and time. Here, we
propose a couple of alternative novel measures based on randomized features of
the samples - the Randomized Generalized Variance and the Randomized Canonical
Correlation. The computational complexity of calculating the proposed
alternatives is linear in the sample size and provide a controllable
approximation of their Kernel-based non-random versions. We also show that
optimization of the proposed statistical properties yields a comparable
separation error at an order of magnitude faster compared to Kernel-based
measures.

 <dc:description>  The paper presents a novel model order reduction technique for large-scale
linear parameter varying (LPV) systems. The approach is based on decoupling the
original dynamics into smaller dimensional LPV subsystems that can be
independently reduced by parameter varying reduction methods. The decomposition
starts with the construction of a modal transformation that separates the modal
subsystems. Hierarchical clustering is applied then to collect the dynamically
similar modal subsystems into larger groups. The subsystems formed from the
groups are then independently reduced. This approach substantially differs from
most of the previously proposed LPV model reduction techniques, since it
performs manipulations on the LPV model and not on a set of linear
time-invariant (LTI) models defined at fixed scheduling parameter values.
Therefore the model interpolation, which is the most challenging part of most
reduction techniques, is avoided. The applicability of the developed algorithm
is thoroughly investigated and demonstrated by numerical case studies.

 <dc:description>  Propositional and modal inclusion logic are formalisms that belong to the
family of logics based on team semantics. This article investigates the model
checking and validity problems of these logics. We identify complexity bounds
for both problems, covering both lax and strict team semantics. By doing so, we
come close to finalising the programme that ultimately aims to classify the
complexities of the central reasoning problems for modal and propositional
dependence, independence, and inclusion logics.

 <dc:title>The Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate: Size and Quality Matters</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Iqbal, Azlan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigate the 'Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate' (DSNS) computational
creativity approach further with respect to the size and quality of images that
can be used to seed the process. In previous work we demonstrated how combining
photographs of people and sequences taken from chess games between weak players
can be used to generate chess problems or puzzles of higher aesthetic quality,
on average, compared to alternative approaches. In this work we show
experimentally that using larger images as opposed to smaller ones improves the
output quality even further. The same is also true for using clearer or less
corrupted images. The reasons why these things influence the DSNS process is
presently not well-understood and debatable but the findings are nevertheless
immediately applicable for obtaining better results.

 <dc:description>  To solve hard problems, AI relies on a variety of disciplines such as logic,
probabilistic reasoning, machine learning and mathematical programming.
Although it is widely accepted that solving real-world problems requires an
integration amongst these, contemporary representation methodologies offer
little support for this.
  In an attempt to alleviate this situation, we introduce a new declarative
programming framework that provides abstractions of well-known problems such as
SAT, Bayesian inference, generative models, and convex optimization. The
semantics of programs is defined in terms of first-order structures with
semiring labels, which allows us to freely combine and integrate problems from
different AI disciplines.

 <dc:description>  A graph is said to be well-covered if all its maximal independent sets are of
the same size. In 1999, Yamashita and Kameda introduced a subclass of
well-covered graphs, called localizable graphs and defined as graphs having a
partition of the vertex set into strong cliques, where a clique in a graph is
strong if it intersects all maximal independent sets. Yamashita and Kameda
observed that all well-covered trees are localizable, pointed out that the
converse inclusion fails in general, and asked for a characterization of
localizable graphs.
  In this paper we obtain several structural and algorithmic results about
localizable graphs. Our results include a proof of the fact that every very
well-covered graph is localizable and characterizations of localizable graphs
within the classes of line graphs, triangle-free graphs, $C_4$-free graphs, and
cubic graphs, each leading to a polynomial time recognition algorithm. On the
negative side, we prove NP-hardness of recognizing localizable graphs within
the classes of weakly chordal graphs, complements of line graphs, and graphs of
independence number three. Furthermore, using localizable graphs we disprove a
conjecture due to Zaare-Nahandi about $k$-partite well-covered graphs having
all maximal cliques of size $k$. Our results unify and generalize several
results from the literature.

 <dc:description>  In scientific computing, more computational power generally implies faster
and possibly more detailed results. The goal of this study was to develop a
framework to submit computational jobs to powerful workstations underused by
nonintensive tasks. This is achieved by using a virtual machine in each of
these workstations, where the computations are done. This group of virtual
machines is called the Gridlan. The Gridlan framework is intermediate between
the cluster and grid computing paradigms. The Gridlan is able to profit from
existing cluster software tools, such as resource managers like Torque, so a
user with previous experience in cluster operation can dispatch jobs
seamlessly. A benchmark test of the Gridlan implementation shows the system's
suitability for computational tasks, principally in embarrassingly parallel
computations.

 <dc:description>  Many objects, especially these made by humans, are symmetric, e.g. cars and
aeroplanes. This paper addresses the estimation of 3D structures of symmetric
objects from multiple images of the same object category, e.g. different cars,
seen from various viewpoints. We assume that the deformation between different
instances from the same object category is non-rigid and symmetric. In this
paper, we extend two leading non-rigid structure from motion (SfM) algorithms
to exploit symmetry constraints. We model the both methods as energy
minimization, in which we also recover the missing observations caused by
occlusions. In particularly, we show that by rotating the coordinate system,
the energy can be decoupled into two independent terms, which still exploit
symmetry, to apply matrix factorization separately on each of them for
initialization. The results on the Pascal3D+ dataset show that our methods
significantly improve performance over baseline methods.

 <dc:description>  We define the deconstruction cost of a tripartite quantum state on systems
$ABE$ as the minimum rate of noise needed to apply to the $AE$ systems, such
that there is negligible disturbance to the marginal state on the $BE$ systems
and the system $A$ of the resulting state is locally recoverable from the $E$
system alone. We refer to such actions as deconstruction operations and
protocols implementing them as state deconstruction protocols. State
deconstruction generalizes Landauer erasure of a single-party quantum state as
well the erasure of correlations of a two-party quantum state. We find that the
deconstruction cost of a tripartite quantum state on systems $ABE$ is equal to
its conditional quantum mutual information (CQMI) $I(A;B|E)$, thus giving the
CQMI an operational interpretation in terms of a state deconstruction protocol.
We also define a related task called conditional erasure, in which the goal is
to apply noise to systems $AE$ in order to decouple system $A$ from systems
$BE$, while causing negligible disturbance to the marginal state of systems
$BE$. We find that the optimal rate of noise for conditional erasure is also
equal to the CQMI $I(A;B|E)$. State deconstruction and conditional erasure lead
to operational interpretations of the quantum discord and squashed
entanglement, which are quantum correlation measures based on the CQMI. We find
that the quantum discord is equal to the cost of simulating einselection, the
process by which a quantum system interacts with an environment, resulting in
selective loss of information in the system. The squashed entanglement is equal
to half the minimum rate of noise needed for deconstruction/conditional erasure
if Alice has available the best possible system $E$ to help in the
deconstruction/conditional erasure task.

 <dc:description>  An autonomous navigation with proven collision avoidance in unknown and
dynamic environments is still a challenge, particularly when there are moving
obstacles. A popular approach to collision avoidance in the face of moving
obstacles is based on model predictive algorithms, which, however, may be
computationally expensive. Hence, we adopt a reactive potential field approach
here. At every cycle, the proposed approach requires only current robot states
relative to the closest obstacle point to find the potential field in the
current position; thus, it is more computationally efficient and more suitable
to scale up for multiple agent scenarios. Our main contribution here is to
write the reactive potential field based motion controller as a hybrid
automaton, and then formally verify its safety using differential dynamic
logic. In particular, we can guarantee a passive safety property, which means
that collisions cannot occur if the robot is to blame, namely a collision can
occur only if the robot is at rest. The proposed controller and verification
results are demonstrated via simulations and implementation on a Pioneer P3-AT
robot.

 <dc:description>  Betweenness centrality (BC) is a crucial graph problem that measures the
significance of a vertex by the number of shortest paths leading through it. We
propose Maximal Frontier Betweenness Centrality (MFBC): a succinct BC algorithm
based on novel sparse matrix multiplication routines that performs a factor of
$p^{1/3}$ less communication on $p$ processors than the best known
alternatives, for graphs with $n$ vertices and average degree $k=n/p^{2/3}$. We
formulate, implement, and prove the correctness of MFBC for weighted graphs by
leveraging monoids instead of semirings, which enables a surprisingly succinct
formulation. MFBC scales well for both extremely sparse and relatively dense
graphs. It automatically searches a space of distributed data decompositions
and sparse matrix multiplication algorithms for the most advantageous
configuration. The MFBC implementation outperforms the well-known CombBLAS
library by up to 8x and shows more robust performance. Our design methodology
is readily extensible to other graph problems.

secondly, why are convolutions in low-resolution (LR) space a better choice?
These are key questions we tried to answer in the paper, but we were not able
to go into as much depth and clarity as we would have liked in the space
allowance. To better answer these questions in this note, we first discuss the
relationships between the deconvolution layer in the forms of the transposed
convolution layer, the sub-pixel convolutional layer and our efficient
sub-pixel convolutional layer. We will refer to our efficient sub-pixel
convolutional layer as a convolutional layer in LR space to distinguish it from
the common sub-pixel convolutional layer. We will then show that for a fixed
computational budget and complexity, a network with convolutions exclusively in
LR space has more representation power at the same speed than a network that
first upsamples the input in high resolution space.

 <dc:description>  Data association is one of the fundamental problems in multi-sensor systems.
Most current techniques rely on pairwise data associations which can be
spurious even after the employment of outlier rejection schemes. Considering
multiple pairwise associations at once significantly increases accuracy and
leads to consistency. In this work, we propose two fully decentralized methods
for consistent global data association from pairwise data associations. The
first method is a consensus algorithm on the set of doubly stochastic matrices.
The second method is a decentralization of the spectral method proposed by
Pachauri et al.. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both methods using
theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation.

 <dc:title>PIR schemes with small download complexity and low storage requirements</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the classical model for (information theoretically secure) Private
Information Retrieval (PIR), a user wishes to retrieve one bit of a database
that is stored on a set of $n$ servers, in such a way that no individual server
gains information about which bit the user is interested in. The aim is to
design schemes that minimise communication between the user and the servers.
More recently, there have been moves to consider more realistic models where
the total storage of the set of servers, or the per server storage, should be
minimised (possibly using techniques from distributed storage), and where the
database is divided into $R$-bit records with $R&gt;1$, and the user wishes to
retrieve one record rather than one bit. When $R$ is large, downloads from the
servers to the user dominate the communication complexity and so the aim is to
minimise the total number of downloaded bits. Shah, Rashmi and Ramchandran show
that at least $R+1$ bits must be downloaded from servers in the worst case, and
provide PIR schemes meeting this bound. Sun and Jafar determine the best
asymptotic download cost of a PIR scheme (as $R\rightarrow\infty$), where this
cost is defined as the ratio of the message length $R$ and the total number of
bits downloaded.
  This paper provides various bounds on the download complexity of a PIR
scheme, generalising those of Shah et al. to the case when the number $n$ of
servers is bounded, and providing links with classical techniques due to Chor
et al. The paper also provides a range of constructions for PIR schemes that
are either simpler or perform better than previously known schemes, including
explicit schemes that achieve the best asymptotic download complexity of Sun
and Jafar with significantly lower upload complexity, and general techniques
for constructing a scheme with good worst case download complexity from a
scheme with good download complexity on average.

 <dc:description>  Entity images could provide significant visual information for knowledge
representation learning. Most conventional methods learn knowledge
representations merely from structured triples, ignoring rich visual
information extracted from entity images. In this paper, we propose a novel
Image-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning model (IKRL), where knowledge
representations are learned with both triple facts and images. More
specifically, we first construct representations for all images of an entity
with a neural image encoder. These image representations are then integrated
into an aggregated image-based representation via an attention-based method. We
evaluate our IKRL models on knowledge graph completion and triple
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our models outperform all
baselines on both tasks, which indicates the significance of visual information
for knowledge representations and the capability of our models in learning
knowledge representations with images.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the problem of finding a low-complexity estimate of the
impulse response of a linear time-invariant discrete-time dynamic system from
noise-corrupted input-output data. To this purpose, we introduce an
identification criterion formed by the average (over the input perturbations)
of a standard prediction error cost, plus a weighted l1 regularization term
which promotes sparse solutions. While it is well known that such criteria do
provide solutions with many zeros, a critical issue in our identification
context is where these zeros are located, since sensible low-order models
should be zero in the tail of the impulse response. The flavor of the key
results in this paper is that, under quite standard assumptions (such as i.i.d.
input and noise sequences and system stability), the estimate of the impulse
response resulting from the proposed criterion is indeed identically zero from
a certain time index (named the leading order) onwards, with arbitrarily high
probability, for a sufficiently large data cardinality. Numerical experiments
are reported that support the theoretical results, and comparisons are made
with some other state-of-the-art methodologies.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we show that by investigating inherent time delays between
different users in a multiuser scenario, we are able to cancel interference
more efficiently. Time asynchrony provides another tool to cancel interference
which results in preserving other resources like frequency, time and code.
Therefore, we can save the invaluable resource of frequency band and also
increase spectral efficiency. A sampling method is presented which results in
independent noise samples and obviates the need for the complex process of
noise whitening. By taking advantage of this sampling method and its unique
structure, we implement maximum-likelihood sequence detection which outperforms
synchronous maximum-likelihood detection. We also present successive
interference cancellation with hard decision passing which gives rise to a
novel forward-backward belief propagation method. Next, the performance of zero
forcing detection is analyzed. Simulation results are also presented to verify
our analysis.

 <dc:title>Generating Abstractive Summaries from Meeting Transcripts</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Summaries of meetings are very important as they convey the essential content
of discussions in a concise form. Generally, it is time consuming to read and
understand the whole documents. Therefore, summaries play an important role as
the readers are interested in only the important context of discussions. In
this work, we address the task of meeting document summarization. Automatic
summarization systems on meeting conversations developed so far have been
primarily extractive, resulting in unacceptable summaries that are hard to
read. The extracted utterances contain disfluencies that affect the quality of
the extractive summaries. To make summaries much more readable, we propose an
approach to generating abstractive summaries by fusing important content from
several utterances. We first separate meeting transcripts into various topic
segments, and then identify the important utterances in each segment using a
supervised learning approach. The important utterances are then combined
together to generate a one-sentence summary. In the text generation step, the
dependency parses of the utterances in each segment are combined together to
create a directed graph. The most informative and well-formed sub-graph
obtained by integer linear programming (ILP) is selected to generate a
one-sentence summary for each topic segment. The ILP formulation reduces
disfluencies by leveraging grammatical relations that are more prominent in
non-conversational style of text, and therefore generates summaries that is
comparable to human-written abstractive summaries. Experimental results show
that our method can generate more informative summaries than the baselines. In
addition, readability assessments by human judges as well as log-likelihood
estimates obtained from the dependency parser show that our generated summaries
are significantly readable and well-formed.

 <dc:description>  Abstractive summarization is an ideal form of summarization since it can
synthesize information from multiple documents to create concise informative
summaries. In this work, we aim at developing an abstractive summarizer. First,
our proposed approach identifies the most important document in the
multi-document set. The sentences in the most important document are aligned to
sentences in other documents to generate clusters of similar sentences. Second,
we generate K-shortest paths from the sentences in each cluster using a
word-graph structure. Finally, we select sentences from the set of shortest
paths generated from all the clusters employing a novel integer linear
programming (ILP) model with the objective of maximizing information content
and readability of the final summary. Our ILP model represents the shortest
paths as binary variables and considers the length of the path, information
score and linguistic quality score in the objective function. Experimental
results on the DUC 2004 and 2005 multi-document summarization datasets show
that our proposed approach outperforms all the baselines and state-of-the-art
extractive summarizers as measured by the ROUGE scores. Our method also
outperforms a recent abstractive summarization technique. In manual evaluation,
our approach also achieves promising results on informativeness and
readability.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an intermittent communication framework for mobile
robot networks. Specifically, we consider robots that move along the edges of a
connected mobility graph and communicate only when they meet at the nodes of
that graph giving rise to a dynamic communication network. Our proposed
distributed controllers ensure intermittent connectivity of the network and
path optimization, simultaneously. We show that the intermittent connectivity
requirement can be encapsulated by a global Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)
formula. Then we approximately decompose it into local LTL expressions which
are then assigned to the robots. To avoid conflicting robot behaviors that can
occur due to this approximate decomposition, we develop a distributed conflict
resolution scheme that generates non-conflicting discrete motion plans for
every robot, based on the assigned local LTL expressions, whose composition
satisfies the global LTL formula. By appropriately introducing delays in the
execution of the generated motion plans we also show that the proposed
controllers can be executed asynchronously.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we deal with two challenges for measuring the similarity of
the subject identities in practical video-based face recognition - the
variation of the head pose in uncontrolled environments and the computational
expense of processing videos. Since the frame-wise feature mean is unable to
characterize the pose diversity among frames, we define and preserve the
overall pose diversity and closeness in a video. Then, identity will be the
only source of variation across videos since the pose varies even within a
single video. Instead of simply using all the frames, we select those faces
whose pose point is closest to the centroid of the K-means cluster containing
that pose point. Then, we represent a video as a bag of frame-wise deep face
features while the number of features has been reduced from hundreds to K.
Since the video representation can well represent the identity, now we measure
the subject similarity between two videos as the max correlation among all
possible pairs in the two bags of features. On the official 5,000 video-pairs
of the YouTube Face dataset for face verification, our algorithm achieves a
comparable performance with VGG-face that averages over deep features of all
frames. Other vision tasks can also benefit from the generic idea of employing
geometric cues to improve the descriptiveness of deep features.

 <dc:description>  We introduce and study Minkowski games. These are two player games, where the
players take turns to chose positions in $\mathbb{R}^d$ based on some rules.
Variants include boundedness games, where one player wants to keep the
positions bounded, and the other wants to escape to infinity; as well as safety
games, where one player wants to stay within a prescribed set, while the other
wants to leave it.
  We provide some general characterizations of which player can win such games,
and explore the computational complexity of the associated decision problems. A
natural representation of boundedness games yields coNP-completeness, whereas
the safety games are undecidable.

 <dc:description>  Sleep apnea is a syndrome that is characterized by sudden breathing halts
while sleeping. One of the common treatments involves wearing a mask that
delivers continuous air flow into the nostrils so as to maintain a steady air
pressure. These masks are designed for an average facial model and are often
difficult to adjust due to poor fit to the actual patient. The incompatibility
is characterized by gaps between the mask and the face, which deteriorates the
impermeability of the mask and leads to air leakage. We suggest a fully
automatic approach for designing a personalized nasal mask interface using a
facial depth scan. The interfaces generated by the proposed method accurately
fit the geometry of the scanned face, and are easy to manufacture. The proposed
method utilizes cheap commodity depth sensors and 3D printing technologies to
efficiently design and manufacture customized masks for patients suffering from
sleep apnea.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel semantic tagging task, sem-tagging, tailored for the
purpose of multilingual semantic parsing, and present the first tagger using
deep residual networks (ResNets). Our tagger uses both word and character
representations and includes a novel residual bypass architecture. We evaluate
the tagset both intrinsically on the new task of semantic tagging, as well as
on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. Our system, consisting of a ResNet and an
auxiliary loss function predicting our semantic tags, significantly outperforms
prior results on English Universal Dependencies POS tagging (95.71% accuracy on
UD v1.2 and 95.67% accuracy on UD v1.3).

maximizing the Nash social welfare (NSW) objective. We write a novel convex
programming relaxation for this problem, and we show that a simple randomized
rounding algorithm gives a $1/e$ approximation factor of the objective.
  Our main technical contribution is an extension of Gurvits's lower bound on
the coefficient of the square-free monomial of a degree $m$-homogeneous stable
polynomial on $m$ variables to all homogeneous polynomials. We use this
extension to analyze the expected welfare of the allocation returned by our
randomized rounding algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We define the Streaming Communication model that combines the main aspects of
communication complexity and streaming. We consider two agents that want to
compute some function that depends on inputs that are distributed to each
agent. The inputs arrive as data streams and each agent has a bounded memory.
Agents are allowed to communicate with each other and also update their memory
based on the input bit they read and the previous message they received.
  We provide tight tradeoffs between the necessary resources, i.e.
communication and memory, for some of the canonical problems from communication
complexity by proving a strong general lower bound technique. Second, we
analyze the Approximate Matching problem and show that the complexity of this
problem (i.e. the achievable approximation ratio) in the one-way variant of our
model is strictly different both from the streaming complexity and the one-way
communication complexity thereof.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a method to train Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) --- neural
networks with extremely low precision (e.g., 1-bit) weights and activations, at
run-time. At train-time the quantized weights and activations are used for
computing the parameter gradients. During the forward pass, QNNs drastically
reduce memory size and accesses, and replace most arithmetic operations with
bit-wise operations. As a result, power consumption is expected to be
drastically reduced. We trained QNNs over the MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN and
ImageNet datasets. The resulting QNNs achieve prediction accuracy comparable to
their 32-bit counterparts. For example, our quantized version of AlexNet with
1-bit weights and 2-bit activations achieves $51\%$ top-1 accuracy. Moreover,
we quantize the parameter gradients to 6-bits as well which enables gradients
computation using only bit-wise operation. Quantized recurrent neural networks
were tested over the Penn Treebank dataset, and achieved comparable accuracy as
their 32-bit counterparts using only 4-bits. Last but not least, we programmed
a binary matrix multiplication GPU kernel with which it is possible to run our
MNIST QNN 7 times faster than with an unoptimized GPU kernel, without suffering
any loss in classification accuracy. The QNN code is available online.

 <dc:description>  We present techniques to prove termination of cycle rewriting, that is,
string rewriting on cycles, which are strings in which the start and end are
connected. Our main technique is to transform cycle rewriting into string
rewriting and then apply state of the art techniques to prove termination of
the string rewrite system. We present three such transformations, and prove for
all of them that they are sound and complete. In this way not only termination
of string rewriting of the transformed system implies termination of the
original cycle rewrite system, a similar conclusion can be drawn for
non-termination. Apart from this transformational approach, we present a
uniform framework of matrix interpretations, covering most of the earlier
approaches to automatically proving termination of cycle rewriting. All our
techniques serve both for proving termination and relative termination. We
present several experiments showing the power of our techniques.

 <dc:title>PIR Array Codes with Optimal PIR Rates</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Blackburn, Simon R.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Etzion, Tuvi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There has been much recent interest in Private information Retrieval (PIR) in
models where a database is stored across several servers using coding
techniques from distributed storage, rather than being simply replicated. In
particular, a recent breakthrough result of Fazelli, Vardy and Yaakobi
introduces the notion of a PIR code and a PIR array code, and uses this notion
to produce efficient protocols.
  In this paper we are interested in designing PIR array codes. We consider the
case when we have $m$ servers, with each server storing a fraction
$(1/\omegaR)$ of the bits of the database; here $\omegaR$ is a fixed rational
number with $\omegaR &gt; 1$. We study the maximum PIR rate of a PIR array code
with the $k$-PIR property (which enables a $k$-server PIR protocol to be
emulated on the $m$ servers), where the PIR rate is defined to be $k/m$. We
present upper bounds on the achievable rate, some constructions, and ideas how
to obtain PIR array codes with the highest possible PIR rate. In particular, we
present constructions that asymptotically meet our upper bounds, and the exact
largest PIR rate is obtained when $1 &lt; \omegaR \leq 2$.

 <dc:description>  Textual information is considered as significant supplement to knowledge
representation learning (KRL). There are two main challenges for constructing
knowledge representations from plain texts: (1) How to take full advantages of
sequential contexts of entities in plain texts for KRL. (2) How to dynamically
select those informative sentences of the corresponding entities for KRL. In
this paper, we propose the Sequential Text-embodied Knowledge Representation
Learning to build knowledge representations from multiple sentences. Given each
reference sentence of an entity, we first utilize recurrent neural network with
pooling or long short-term memory network to encode the semantic information of
the sentence with respect to the entity. Then we further design an attention
model to measure the informativeness of each sentence, and build text-based
representations of entities. We evaluate our method on two tasks, including
triple classification and link prediction. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms other baselines on both tasks, which indicates that
our method is capable of selecting informative sentences and encoding the
textual information well into knowledge representations.

was proposed by Kilmer and Martin~\cite{2011kilmer} has been applied
successfully in many fields, such as computed tomography, facial recognition,
and video completion. In this paper, we propose a method that extends a
well-known randomized matrix method to the t-SVD. This method can produce a
factorization with similar properties to the t-SVD, but is more computationally
efficient on very large datasets. We present details of the algorithm,
theoretical results, and provide numerical results that show the promise of our
approach for compressing and analyzing datasets. We also present an improved
analysis of the randomized subspace iteration for matrices, which may be of
independent interest to the scientific community.

 <dc:description>  Algorithms for bandit convex optimization and online learning often rely on
constructing noisy gradient estimates, which are then used in appropriately
adjusted first-order algorithms, replacing actual gradients. Depending on the
properties of the function to be optimized and the nature of &quot;noise&quot; in the
bandit feedback, the bias and variance of gradient estimates exhibit various
tradeoffs. In this paper we propose a novel framework that replaces the
specific gradient estimation methods with an abstract oracle. With the help of
the new framework we unify previous works, reproducing their results in a clean
and concise fashion, while, perhaps more importantly, the framework also allows
us to formally show that to achieve the optimal root-$n$ rate either the
algorithms that use existing gradient estimators, or the proof techniques used
to analyze them have to go beyond what exists today.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning (RL) can automate a wide variety of robotic skills,
but learning each new skill requires considerable real-world data collection
and manual representation engineering to design policy classes or features.
Using deep reinforcement learning to train general purpose neural network
policies alleviates some of the burden of manual representation engineering by
using expressive policy classes, but exacerbates the challenge of data
collection, since such methods tend to be less efficient than RL with
low-dimensional, hand-designed representations. Transfer learning can mitigate
this problem by enabling us to transfer information from one skill to another
and even from one robot to another. We show that neural network policies can be
decomposed into &quot;task-specific&quot; and &quot;robot-specific&quot; modules, where the
task-specific modules are shared across robots, and the robot-specific modules
are shared across all tasks on that robot. This allows for sharing task
information, such as perception, between robots and sharing robot information,
such as dynamics and kinematics, between tasks. We exploit this decomposition
to train mix-and-match modules that can solve new robot-task combinations that
were not seen during training. Using a novel neural network architecture, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our transfer method for enabling zero-shot
generalization with a variety of robots and tasks in simulation for both visual
and non-visual tasks.

 <dc:description>  The increasingly photorealistic sample quality of generative image models
suggests their feasibility in applications beyond image generation. We present
the Neural Photo Editor, an interface that leverages the power of generative
neural networks to make large, semantically coherent changes to existing
images. To tackle the challenge of achieving accurate reconstructions without
loss of feature quality, we introduce the Introspective Adversarial Network, a
novel hybridization of the VAE and GAN. Our model efficiently captures
long-range dependencies through use of a computational block based on
weight-shared dilated convolutions, and improves generalization performance
with Orthogonal Regularization, a novel weight regularization method. We
validate our contributions on CelebA, SVHN, and CIFAR-100, and produce samples
and reconstructions with high visual fidelity.

 <dc:description>  Annotating semantic data with metadata is becoming more and more important to
provide information about the statements being asserted. While initial
solutions proposed a data model to represent a specific dimension of
meta-information (such as time or provenance), the need for a general
annotation framework which allows representing different context dimensions is
needed. In this paper, we extend the 4dFluents ontology by Welty and Fikes---on
associating temporal validity to statements---to any dimension of context, and
discuss possible issues that multidimensional context representations have to
face and how we address them.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The fast-growing Web API landscape brings clients more options than ever
before-in theory. In practice, they cannot easily switch between different
providers offering similar functionality. We discuss an approach to develop Web
APIs based on reuse of interface parts called features. Through the
introduction of 5 design principles, we investigate the impact of feature-based
reuse on Web APIs. Applying these principles enables a granular reuse of client
and server code, documentation, and tools. Together, they can foster a
measurable ecosystem with cross-API compatibility, opening the door to a
smarter generation of Web clients.

 <dc:title>Organized Complexity: is Big History a Big Computation?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Delahaye, Jean-Paul</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Vidal, Clement</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The concept of &quot;logical depth&quot; introduced by Charles H. Bennett (1988) seems
to capture, at least partially, the notion of organized complexity, so central
in big history. More precisely, the increase in organized complexity refers
here to the wealth, variety and intricacy of structures, and should not be
confused with the increase of random complexity, formalized by Kolmogorov
(1965). If Bennett is right in proposing to assimilate organized complexity
with &quot;computational content&quot;, then the fundamental cause of the increase of
complexity in the universe is the existence of computing mechanisms with
memory, and able to cumulatively create and preserve computational contents. In
this view, the universe computes, remembers its calculations, and reuses them
to conduct further computations. Evolutionary mechanisms are such forms of
cumulative computation with memory and we owe them the organized complexity of
life. Language, writing, culture, science and technology can also be analyzed
as computation mechanisms generating, preserving and accelerating the increase
in organized complexity. The main unifying theme for big history is the energy
rate density, a metric based on thermodynamics. However useful, this metric
does not provide much insight into the role that information and computation
play in our universe. The concept of &quot;logical depth&quot; provides a new lens to
examine the increase of organized complexity. We argue in this paper that
organized complexity is a valid and useful way to make sense of big history.
Additionally, logical depth has a rigorous formal definition in theoretical
computer science that hints at a broader research program to quantify
complexity in the universe.

 <dc:description>  The computational efficiency of the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD)
method can be significantly reduced by the presence of complex objects with
fine features. Small geometrical details impose a fine mesh and a reduced time
step, significantly increasing computational cost. Model order reduction has
been proposed as a systematic way to generate compact models for complex
objects, that one can then instantiate into a main FDTD mesh. However, the
stability of FDTD with embedded reduced models remains an open problem. We
propose a systematic method to generate reduced models for FDTD domains, and
embed them into a main FDTD mesh with guaranteed stability. Models can be
created for arbitrary domains containing inhomogeneous and lossy materials. The
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) limit of the final scheme is provided by the
theory, and can be extended with a simple perturbation of the coefficients of
the reduced models. Numerical tests confirm the stability of the proposed
method, and its potential to accelerate multiscale FDTD simulations.

 <dc:title>Optimal Placement and Sizing of Distributed Battery Storage in Low
  Voltage Grids using Receding Horizon Control Strategies</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a novel methodology for leveraging Receding Horizon
Control (RHC), also known as Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies for
distributed battery storage in a planning problem using a Benders decomposition
technique. Longer prediction horizons lead to better storage placement
strategies but also higher computational complexity that can quickly become
computationally prohibitive. The here proposed MPC strategy in conjunction with
a Benders decomposition technique effectively reduces the computational
complexity to a manageable level. We use the CIGRE low voltage (LV) benchmark
grid as a case study for solving an optimal placement and sizing problem for
different control strategies with different MPC prediction horizons. The
objective of the MPC strategy is to maximize the photovoltaic (PV) utilization
and minimize battery degradation in a local residential area, while satisfying
all grid constraints. For this case study we show that the economic value of
battery storage is higher when using MPC based storage control strategies than
when using heuristic storage control strategies, because MPC strategies
explicitly exploit the value of forecast information. The economic merit of
this approach can be further increased by explicitly incorporating a battery
degradation model in the MPC strategy.

 <dc:title>A Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Speech Enhancement</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Lee, Jinwon</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In hearing aids, the presence of babble noise degrades hearing
intelligibility of human speech greatly. However, removing the babble without
creating artifacts in human speech is a challenging task in a low SNR
environment. Here, we sought to solve the problem by finding a `mapping'
between noisy speech spectra and clean speech spectra via supervised learning.
Specifically, we propose using fully Convolutional Neural Networks, which
consist of lesser number of parameters than fully connected networks. The
proposed network, Redundant Convolutional Encoder Decoder (R-CED), demonstrates
that a convolutional network can be 12 times smaller than a recurrent network
and yet achieves better performance, which shows its applicability for an
embedded system: the hearing aids.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the Non-commutative Subset Convolution - a convolution of
functions useful when working with determinant-based algorithms. In order to
compute it efficiently, we take advantage of Clifford algebras, a
generalization of quaternions used mainly in the quantum field theory.
  We apply this tool to speed up algorithms counting subgraphs parameterized by
the treewidth of a graph. We present an $O^*((2^\omega + 1)^{tw})$-time
algorithm for counting Steiner trees and an $O^*((2^\omega + 2)^{tw})$-time
algorithm for counting Hamiltonian cycles, both of which improve the previously
known upper bounds. The result for Steiner Tree also translates into a
deterministic algorithm for Feedback Vertex Set. All of these constitute the
best known running times of deterministic algorithms for decision versions of
these problems and they match the best obtained running times for pathwidth
parameterization under assumption $\omega = 2$.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the input convex neural network architecture. These are
scalar-valued (potentially deep) neural networks with constraints on the
network parameters such that the output of the network is a convex function of
(some of) the inputs. The networks allow for efficient inference via
optimization over some inputs to the network given others, and can be applied
to settings including structured prediction, data imputation, reinforcement
learning, and others. In this paper we lay the basic groundwork for these
models, proposing methods for inference, optimization and learning, and analyze
their representational power. We show that many existing neural network
architectures can be made input-convex with a minor modification, and develop
specialized optimization algorithms tailored to this setting. Finally, we
highlight the performance of the methods on multi-label prediction, image
completion, and reinforcement learning problems, where we show improvement over
the existing state of the art in many cases.

 <dc:description>  We assume that, within the dense clusters of neurons that can be found in
nuclei, cells may interconnect via soma-to-soma interactions, in addition to
conventional synaptic connections. We illustrate this idea with a multi-layer
architecture (MLA) composed of multiple clusters of recurrent sub-networks of
spiking Random Neural Networks (RNN) with dense soma-to-soma interactions, and
use this RNN-MLA architecture for deep learning. The inputs to the clusters are
first normalised by adjusting the external arrival rates of spikes to each
cluster. Then we apply this architecture to learning from multi-channel
datasets. Numerical results based on both images and sensor based data, show
the value of this novel architecture for deep learning.

 <dc:description>  Image quality assessment (IQA) continues to garner great interest in the
research community, particularly given the tremendous rise in consumer video
capture and streaming. Despite significant research effort in IQA in the past
few decades, the area of no-reference image quality assessment remains a great
challenge and is largely unsolved. In this paper, we propose a novel
no-reference image quality assessment system called Deep Quality, which
leverages the power of deep learning to model the complex relationship between
visual content and the perceived quality. Deep Quality consists of a novel
multi-scale deep convolutional neural network, trained to learn to assess image
quality based on training samples consisting of different distortions and
degradations such as blur, Gaussian noise, and compression artifacts.
Preliminary results using the CSIQ benchmark image quality dataset showed that
Deep Quality was able to achieve strong quality prediction performance (89%
patch-level and 98% image-level prediction accuracy), being able to achieve
similar performance as full-reference IQA methods.

 <dc:description>  When research groups are evaluated by an expert panel, it is an open question
how one can determine the match between panel and research groups. In this
paper, we outline two quantitative approaches that determine the cognitive
distance between evaluators and evaluees, based on the journals they have
published in. We use example data from four research evaluations carried out
between 2009 and 2014 at the University of Antwerp.
  While the barycenter approach is based on a journal map, the
similarity-adapted publication vector (SAPV) approach is based on the full
journal similarity matrix. Both approaches determine an entity's profile based
on the journals in which it has published. Subsequently, we determine the
Euclidean distance between the barycenter or SAPV profiles of two entities as
an indicator of the cognitive distance between them. Using a bootstrapping
approach, we determine confidence intervals for these distances. As such, the
present article constitutes a refinement of a previous proposal that operates
on the level of Web of Science subject categories.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A characterization of a class of optimal three-weight cyclic codes of
dimension 3 over any finite field was recently presented in [10]. Shortly after
this, a generalization for the sufficient numerical conditions of such
characterization was given in [3]. The main purpose of this work is to show
that the numerical conditions found in [3], are also necessary. As we will see
later, an interesting feature of the present work, in clear contrast with these
two preceding works, is that we use some new and non-conventional methods in
order to achieve our goals. In fact, through these non-conventional methods, we
not only were able to extend the characterization in [10], but also present a
less complex proof of such extended characterization, which avoids the use of
some of the sophisticated --but at the same time complex-- theorems, that are
the key arguments of the proofs given in [10] and [3]. Furthermore, we also
find the parameters for the dual code of any cyclic code in our extended
characterization class. In fact, after the analysis of some examples, it seems
that such dual codes always have the same parameters as the best known linear
codes.

 <dc:description>  Third-party services form an integral part of the mobile ecosystem: they
allow app developers to add features such as performance analytics and social
network integration, and to monetize their apps by enabling user tracking and
targeted ad delivery. At present users, researchers, and regulators all have at
best limited understanding of this third-party ecosystem. In this paper we seek
to shrink this gap. Using data from users of our ICSI Haystack app we gain a
rich view of the mobile ecosystem: we identify and characterize domains
associated with mobile advertising and user tracking, thereby taking an
important step towards greater transparency. We furthermore outline our steps
towards a public catalog and census of analytics services, their behavior,
their personal data collection processes, and their use across mobile apps.

 <dc:description>  The conventional approach to scaling Software Defined Networking (SDN)
controllers today is to partition switches based on network topology, with each
partition being controlled by a single physical controller, running all SDN
applications. However, topological partitioning is limited by the fact that (i)
performance of latency-sensitive (e.g., monitoring) SDN applications associated
with a given partition may be impacted by co-located compute-intensive (e.g.,
route computation) applications; (ii) simultaneously achieving low convergence
time and response times might be challenging; and (iii) communication between
instances of an application across partitions may increase latencies. To tackle
these issues, in this paper, we explore functional slicing, a complementary
approach to scaling, where multiple SDN applications belonging to the same
topological partition may be placed in physically distinct servers. We present
Hydra, a framework for distributed SDN controllers based on functional slicing.
Hydra chooses partitions based on convergence time as the primary metric, but
places application instances across partitions in a manner that keeps response
times low while considering communication between applications of a partition,
and instances of an application across partitions. Evaluations using the
Floodlight controller show the importance and effectiveness of Hydra in
simultaneously keeping convergence times on failures small, while sustaining
higher throughput per partition and ensuring responsiveness to
latency-sensitive applications.

 <dc:title>Annotating Derivations: A New Evaluation Strategy and Dataset for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new evaluation for automatic solvers for algebra word problems,
which can identify mistakes that existing evaluations overlook. Our proposal is
to evaluate such solvers using derivations, which reflect how an equation
system was constructed from the word problem. To accomplish this, we develop an
algorithm for checking the equivalence between two derivations, and show how
derivation an- notations can be semi-automatically added to existing datasets.
To make our experiments more comprehensive, we include the derivation
annotation for DRAW-1K, a new dataset containing 1000 general algebra word
problems. In our experiments, we found that the annotated derivations enable a
more accurate evaluation of automatic solvers than previously used metrics. We
release derivation annotations for over 2300 algebra word problems for future
evaluations.

 <dc:description>  Multilayer graphs are commonly used for representing different relations
between entities and handling heterogeneous data processing tasks. New
challenges arise in multilayer graph clustering for assigning clusters to a
common multilayer node set and for combining information from each layer. This
paper presents a theoretical framework for multilayer spectral graph clustering
of the nodes via convex layer aggregation. Under a novel multilayer signal plus
noise model, we provide a phase transition analysis that establishes the
existence of a critical value on the noise level that permits reliable cluster
separation. The analysis also specifies analytical upper and lower bounds on
the critical value, where the bounds become exact when the clusters have
identical sizes. Numerical experiments on synthetic multilayer graphs are
conducted to validate the phase transition analysis and study the effect of
layer weights and noise levels on clustering reliability.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a progressive learning algorithm for multi-label
classification to learn new labels while retaining the knowledge of previous
labels is designed. New output neurons corresponding to new labels are added
and the neural network connections and parameters are automatically
restructured as if the label has been introduced from the beginning. This work
is the first of the kind in multi-label classifier for class-incremental
learning. It is useful for real-world applications such as robotics where
streaming data are available and the number of labels is often unknown. Based
on the Extreme Learning Machine framework, a novel universal classifier with
plug and play capabilities for progressive multi-label classification is
developed. Experimental results on various benchmark synthetic and real
datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  A substring Q of a string S is called a shortest unique substring (SUS) for
interval [s,t] in S, if Q occurs exactly once in S, this occurrence of Q
contains interval [s,t], and every substring of S which contains interval [s,t]
and is shorter than Q occurs at least twice in S. The SUS problem is, given a
string S, to preprocess S so that for any subsequent query interval [s,t] all
the SUSs for interval [s,t] can be answered quickly. When s = t, we call the
SUSs for [s,t] as point SUSs, and when s \leq t, we call the SUSs for [s,t] as
interval SUSs. There exist optimal O(n)-time preprocessing scheme which answers
queries in optimal O(k) time for both point and interval SUSs, where n is the
length of S and k is the number of outputs for a given query. In this paper, we
reveal structural, combinatorial properties underlying the SUS problem: Namely,
we show that the number of intervals in S that correspond to point SUSs for all
query positions in S is less than 1.5n, and show that this is a matching upper
and lower bound. Also, we consider the maximum number of intervals in S that
correspond to interval SUSs for all query intervals in S.

 <dc:description>  Neural network based models have achieved impressive results on various
specific tasks. However, in previous works, most models are learned separately
based on single-task supervised objectives, which often suffer from
insufficient training data. In this paper, we propose two deep architectures
which can be trained jointly on multiple related tasks. More specifically, we
augment neural model with an external memory, which is shared by several tasks.
Experiments on two groups of text classification tasks show that our proposed
architectures can improve the performance of a task with the help of other
related tasks.

 <dc:title>EFANNA : An Extremely Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search Algorithm
  Based on kNN Graph</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fu, Cong</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is a fundamental problem in many
areas of data mining, machine learning and computer vision. The performance of
traditional hierarchical structure (tree) based methods decreases as the
dimensionality of data grows, while hashing based methods usually lack
efficiency in practice. Recently, the graph based methods have drawn
considerable attention. The main idea is that \emph{a neighbor of a neighbor is
also likely to be a neighbor}, which we refer as \emph{NN-expansion}. These
methods construct a $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$NN) graph offline. And at online
search stage, these methods find candidate neighbors of a query point in some
way (\eg, random selection), and then check the neighbors of these candidate
neighbors for closer ones iteratively. Despite some promising results, there
are mainly two problems with these approaches: 1) These approaches tend to
converge to local optima. 2) Constructing a $k$NN graph is time consuming. We
find that these two problems can be nicely solved when we provide a good
initialization for NN-expansion. In this paper, we propose EFANNA, an extremely
fast approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm based on $k$NN Graph. Efanna
nicely combines the advantages of hierarchical structure based methods and
nearest-neighbor-graph based methods. Extensive experiments have shown that
EFANNA outperforms the state-of-art algorithms both on approximate nearest
neighbor search and approximate nearest neighbor graph construction. To the
best of our knowledge, EFANNA is the fastest algorithm so far both on
approximate nearest neighbor graph construction and approximate nearest
neighbor search. A library EFANNA based on this research is released on Github.

 <dc:title>Reducing DRAM Access Latency by Exploiting DRAM Leakage Characteristics
  and Common Access Patterns</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hassan, Hasan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  DRAM-based memory is a critical factor that creates a bottleneck on the
system performance since the processor speed largely outperforms the DRAM
latency. In this thesis, we develop a low-cost mechanism, called ChargeCache,
which enables faster access to recently-accessed rows in DRAM, with no
modifications to DRAM chips. Our mechanism is based on the key observation that
a recently-accessed row has more charge and thus the following access to the
same row can be performed faster. To exploit this observation, we propose to
track the addresses of recently-accessed rows in a table in the memory
controller. If a later DRAM request hits in that table, the memory controller
uses lower timing parameters, leading to reduced DRAM latency. Row addresses
are removed from the table after a specified duration to ensure rows that have
leaked too much charge are not accessed with lower latency. We evaluate
ChargeCache on a wide variety of workloads and show that it provides
significant performance and energy benefits for both single-core and multi-core
systems.

 <dc:description>  What does it mean for an algorithm to be fair? Different papers use different
notions of algorithmic fairness, and although these appear internally
consistent, they also seem mutually incompatible. We present a mathematical
setting in which the distinctions in previous papers can be made formal. In
addition to characterizing the spaces of inputs (the &quot;observed&quot; space) and
outputs (the &quot;decision&quot; space), we introduce the notion of a construct space: a
space that captures unobservable, but meaningful variables for the prediction.
  We show that in order to prove desirable properties of the entire
decision-making process, different mechanisms for fairness require different
assumptions about the nature of the mapping from construct space to decision
space. The results in this paper imply that future treatments of algorithmic
fairness should more explicitly state assumptions about the relationship
between constructs and observations.

 <dc:description>  The problem under consideration is the synthesis of a distributed controller
for a nonlinear network composed of input affine systems. The objective is to
achieve exponential convergence of the solutions. To design such a feedback
law, methods based on contraction theory are employed to render the
controller-synthesis problem scalable and suitable to use distributed
optimization. The nature of the proposed approach is constructive, because the
computation of the desired feedback law is obtained by solving a convex
optimization problem. An example illustrates the proposed methodology.

 <dc:description>  We provide an efficient algorithm for determining how a road network has
evolved over time, given two snapshot instances from different dates. To allow
for such determinations across different databases and even against hand drawn
maps, we take a strictly topological approach in this paper, so that we compare
road networks based strictly on graph-theoretic properties. Given two road
networks of same region from two different dates, our approach allows one to
match road network portions that remain intact and also point out added or
removed portions. We analyze our algorithm both theoretically, showing that it
runs in polynomial time for non-degenerate road networks even though a related
problem is NP-complete, and experimentally, using dated road networks from the
TIGER/Line archive of the U.S. Census Bureau.

 <dc:title>A New Statistic Feature of the Short-Time Amplitude Spectrum Values for
  Human's Unvoiced Pronunciation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhuang, Xiaodong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a new statistic feature of the discrete short-time amplitude
spectrum is discovered by experiments for the signals of unvoiced
pronunciation. For the random-varying short-time spectrum, this feature reveals
the relationship between the amplitude's average and its standard for every
frequency component. On the other hand, the association between the amplitude
distributions for different frequency components is also studied. A new model
representing such association is inspired by the normalized histogram of
amplitude. By mathematical analysis, the new statistic feature discovered is
proved to be necessary evidence which supports the proposed model, and also can
be direct evidence for the widely used hypothesis of &quot;identical distribution of
amplitude for all frequencies&quot;.

 <dc:title>Determinability and state estimation for switched differential-algebraic

 <dc:description>  The problem of state reconstruction and estimation is considered for a class
of switched dynamical systems whose subsystems are modeled using linear
differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Since this system class imposes
time-varying dynamic and static (in the form of algebraic constraints)
relations on the evolution of state trajectories, an appropriate notion of
observability is presented which accommodates these phenomena. Based on this
notion, we first derive a formula for the reconstruction of the state of the
system where we explicitly obtain an injective mapping from the output to the
state. In practice, such a mapping may be difficult to realize numerically and
hence a class of estimators is proposed which ensures that the state estimate
converges asymptotically to the real state of the system.

 <dc:title>Taking a Detour to Zero: An Alternative Formalization of Functions
  Beyond PR</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cerna, David M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There are two well known systems formalizing total recursion beyond primitive
recursion (\textbf{PR}), system \textbf{T} by G\&quot;odel and system \textbf{F} by
Girard and Reynolds. system \textbf{T} defines recursion on typed objects and
can construct every function of Heyting arithmetic (\textbf{HA}). System
\textbf{F} introduces type variables which can define the recursion of system
\textbf{T}. The result is a system as expressive as second-order Heyting
arithmetic (\textbf{HA}$_{2}$). Though, both are able to express unimaginably
fast growing functions, in some applications a more flexible formalism is
needed. One such application is CERES cut-elimination for schematic
\textbf{LK}-proofs ($CERES_{s}$) where the shape of the recursion is important.
In this paper we introduce a formalism for fast growing functions without a
type theory foundation. The recursion is indexed by ordered sets of natural
numbers. We highlight the relationship between our recursion and the Wainer
hierarchy to provide an comparison to existing systems. We can show that our
formalism expresses the functions expressible using system \textbf{T}. We leave
comparison to system \textbf{F} and beyond to future work.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by the great success and adoption of Bitcoin, a number of
cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum are becoming
increasingly popular. Although existing blockchain-based cryptocurrency schemes
can ensure reasonable security for transactions, they do not consider any
notion of fairness. Fair exchange allows two players to exchange digital
&quot;items&quot;, such as digital signatures, over insecure networks fairly, so that
either each player gets the other's item, or neither player does. Given that
blockchain participants typically do not trust each other, enabling fairness in
existing cryptocurrencies is an essential but insufficiently explored problem.
  In this paper, we explore the solution space for enabling the fair exchange
of a cryptocurrency payment for a receipt. We identify the timeliness of an
exchange as an important property especially when one of the parties involved
in the exchange is resource-constrained. We introduce the notion of strong
timeliness for a fair exchange protocol and propose two fair
payment-for-receipt protocol instantiations that leverage functionality of the
blockchain to achieve strong timeliness. We implement both and compare their
security and efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Many objects in the real world are difficult to describe by a single
numerical vector of a fixed length, whereas describing them by a set of vectors
is more natural. Therefore, Multiple instance learning (MIL) techniques have
been constantly gaining on importance throughout last years. MIL formalism
represents each object (sample) by a set (bag) of feature vectors (instances)
of fixed length where knowledge about objects (e.g., class label) is available
on bag level but not necessarily on instance level. Many standard tools
including supervised classifiers have been already adapted to MIL setting since
the problem got formalized in late nineties. In this work we propose a neural
network (NN) based formalism that intuitively bridges the gap between MIL
problem definition and the vast existing knowledge-base of standard models and
classifiers. We show that the proposed NN formalism is effectively optimizable
by a modified back-propagation algorithm and can reveal unknown patterns inside
bags. Comparison to eight types of classifiers from the prior art on a set of
14 publicly available benchmark datasets confirms the advantages and accuracy
of the proposed solution.

 <dc:description>  Semi-supervised clustering methods incorporate a limited amount of
supervision into the clustering process. Typically, this supervision is
provided by the user in the form of pairwise constraints. Existing methods use
such constraints in one of the following ways: they adapt their clustering
procedure, their similarity metric, or both. All of these approaches operate
within the scope of individual clustering algorithms. In contrast, we propose
to use constraints to choose between clusterings generated by very different
unsupervised clustering algorithms, run with different parameter settings. We
empirically show that this simple approach often outperforms existing
semi-supervised clustering methods.

 <dc:title>Random Popular Matchings with Incomplete Preference Lists</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  For a set $A$ of $n$ people and a set $B$ of $m$ items, with each person
having a preference list that ranks some items in order of preference, we
consider the problem of matching every person with a unique item. A matching
$M$ is \textit{popular} if for any other matching $M'$, the number of people
who prefer $M$ to $M'$ is not less than the number of those who prefer $M'$ to
$M$. For given $n$ and $m$, consider the probability of existence of a popular
matching when each person's preference list is independently and uniformly
generated at random. Previously, Mahdian showed that when people's preference
lists are \textit{strict} (containing no ties) and \textit{complete}
(containing all items in $B$), if $\alpha = m/n &gt; \alpha_*$, where $\alpha_*
\approx 1.42$ is the root of equation $x^2 = e^{1/x}$, then a popular matching
exists with probability $1-o(1)$; and if $\alpha &lt; \alpha_*$, then a popular
matching exists with probability $o(1)$, i.e. a phase transition occurs at
$\alpha_*$. In this paper, we investigate phase transitions in more general
cases when people's preference lists are not complete. In particular, we show
that in the case that each person has a preference list of length $k$, if
$\alpha &gt; \alpha_k$, where $\alpha_k \geq 1$ is the root of equation $x
e^{-1/2x} = 1-(1-e^{-1/x})^{k-1}$, then a popular matching exists with
probability $1-o(1)$; and if $\alpha &lt; \alpha_k$, then a popular matching
exists with probability $o(1)$.

 <dc:title>A Computer Algebra Package for Polynomial Sequence Recognition</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Schmidt, Maxie D.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Mathematical Software</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The software package developed in the MS thesis research implements functions
for the intelligent guessing of polynomial sequence formulas based on
user-defined expected sequence factors of the input coefficients. We present a
specialized hybrid approach to finding exact representations for polynomial
sequences that is motivated by the need for an automated procedures to discover
the precise forms of these sums based on user guidance, or intuition, as to
special sequence factors present in the formulas. In particular, the package
combines the user input on the expected special sequence factors in the
polynomial coefficient formulas with calls to the existing functions as
subroutines that then process formulas for the remaining sequence terms already
recognized by these packages.
  The factorization-based approach to polynomial sequence recognition is unique
to this package and allows the search functions to find expressions for
polynomial sums involving Stirling numbers and other special triangular
sequences that are not readily handled by other software packages. In contrast
to many other sequence recognition and summation software, the package not
provide an explicit proof, or certificate, for the correctness of these
sequence formulas -- only computationally guided educated guesses at a complete
identity generating the sequence over all $n$. The thesis contains a number of
concrete, working examples of the package that are intended to both demonstrate
its usage and to document its current sequence recognition capabilities.

 <dc:description>  Social Engineering (SE) is one of the most dangerous aspect an attacker can
use against a given entity (private citizen, industry, government, ...). In
order to perform SE attacks, it is necessary to collect as much information as
possible about the target (or victim(s)). The aim of this paper is to report
the details of an activity which took to the development of an automatic tool
that extracts, categorizes and summarizes the target interests, thus possible
weaknesses with respect to specific topics. Data is collected from the user's
activity on social networks, parsed and analyzed using text mining techniques.
The main contribution of the proposed tool consists in delivering some reports
that allow the citizen, institutions as well as private bodies the screening of
their exposure to SE attacks, with a strong awareness potential that will be
reflected in a decrease of the risks and a good opportunity to save money.

 <dc:description>  Multi-view face detection in open environment is a challenging task due to
diverse variations of face appearances and shapes. Most multi-view face
detectors depend on multiple models and organize them in parallel, pyramid or
tree structure, which compromise between the accuracy and time-cost. Aiming at
a more favorable multi-view face detector, we propose a novel funnel-structured
cascade (FuSt) detection framework. In a coarse-to-fine flavor, our FuSt
consists of, from top to bottom, 1) multiple view-specific fast LAB cascade for
extremely quick face proposal, 2) multiple coarse MLP cascade for further
candidate window verification, and 3) a unified fine MLP cascade with
shape-indexed features for accurate face detection. Compared with other
structures, on the one hand, the proposed one uses multiple computationally
efficient distributed classifiers to propose a small number of candidate
windows but with a high recall of multi-view faces. On the other hand, by using
a unified MLP cascade to examine proposals of all views in a centralized style,
it provides a favorable solution for multi-view face detection with high
accuracy and low time-cost. Besides, the FuSt detector is alignment-aware and
performs a coarse facial part prediction which is beneficial for subsequent
face alignment. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets, FDDB and
AFW, demonstrate the effectiveness of our FuSt detector in both accuracy and
speed.

 <dc:description>  Marker-based and marker-less optical skeletal motion-capture methods use an
outside-in arrangement of cameras placed around a scene, with viewpoints
converging on the center. They often create discomfort by possibly needed
marker suits, and their recording volume is severely restricted and often
constrained to indoor scenes with controlled backgrounds. Alternative
suit-based systems use several inertial measurement units or an exoskeleton to
capture motion. This makes capturing independent of a confined volume, but
requires substantial, often constraining, and hard to set up body
instrumentation. We therefore propose a new method for real-time, marker-less
and egocentric motion capture which estimates the full-body skeleton pose from
a lightweight stereo pair of fisheye cameras that are attached to a helmet or
virtual reality headset. It combines the strength of a new generative pose
estimation framework for fisheye views with a ConvNet-based body-part detector
trained on a large new dataset. Our inside-in method captures full-body motion
in general indoor and outdoor scenes, and also crowded scenes with many people
in close vicinity. The captured user can freely move around, which enables
reconstruction of larger-scale activities and is particularly useful in virtual
reality to freely roam and interact, while seeing the fully motion-captured
virtual body.

 <dc:description>  In this work we explore deep generative models of text in which the latent
representation of a document is itself drawn from a discrete language model
distribution. We formulate a variational auto-encoder for inference in this
model and apply it to the task of compressing sentences. In this application
the generative model first draws a latent summary sentence from a background
language model, and then subsequently draws the observed sentence conditioned
on this latent summary. In our empirical evaluation we show that generative
formulations of both abstractive and extractive compression yield
state-of-the-art results when trained on a large amount of supervised data.
Further, we explore semi-supervised compression scenarios where we show that it
is possible to achieve performance competitive with previously proposed
supervised models while training on a fraction of the supervised data.

 <dc:description>  RNA can be used as a high-density medium for data storage and transmission;
however, an important RNA process -- replication -- is noisy. This paper
presents an error analysis for RNA as a data transmission medium, analyzing how
deletion errors increase in a collection of replicated DNA strands over time.

 <dc:title>A short review and primer on eye tracking in human computer interaction

 <dc:creator>Lukander, Kristian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The application of psychophysiologicy in human-computer interaction is a
growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems.
Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of
physiological signals and analysis techniques.
  Eye tracking is a widely used method for tracking user attention with gaze
location, but also provides information on the internal cognitive and
contextual state, intention, and the locus of the user's visual attention in
interactive settings through a number of eye and eyelid movement related
parameters. This paper presents a short review on the application of eye
tracking in human-computer interaction.
  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid
familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We put special emphasis on
everyday human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more
common clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology.
  This paper is an extract from a comprehensive review of the entire field of
ambulatory psychophysiology, including 12 similar chapters, plus application
guidelines and systematic review. Thus any citation should be made using the

  Human speech affords, alongside linguistic content, rich information in the
intonation, voice quality, prosody, and rhythmic variation of utterances,
allowing listeners to recognise numerous distinct emotional states in the
speaker. Several types of factors affect speech, ranging from emotions to
cognitive load and pathological conditions, providing a promising non-intrusive
source for online understanding of context and psychophysiological state.

 <dc:description>  With the increasing amount of mobility data being collected on a daily basis
by location-based services (LBSs) comes a new range of threats for users,
related to the over-sharing of their location information. To deal with this
issue, several location privacy protection mechanisms (LPPMs) have been
proposed in the past years. However, each of these mechanisms comes with
different configuration parameters that have a direct impact both on the
privacy guarantees offered to the users and on the resulting utility of the
protected data. In this context, it can be difficult for non-expert system
designers to choose the appropriate configuration to use. Moreover, these
mechanisms are generally configured once for all, which results in the same
configuration for every protected piece of information. However, not all users
have the same behaviour, and even the behaviour of a single user is likely to
change over time. To address this issue, we present in this paper ALP, a new
framework enabling the dynamic configuration of LPPMs. ALP can be used in two
scenarios: (1) offline, where ALP enables a system designer to choose and
automatically tune the most appropriate LPPM for the protection of a given
dataset; (2) online, where ALP enables the user of a crowd sensing application
to protect consecutive batches of her geolocated data by automatically tuning
an existing LPPM to fulfil a set of privacy and utility objectives. We evaluate
ALP on both scenarios with two real-life mobility datasets and two
state-of-the-art LPPMs. Our experiments show that the adaptive LPPM
configurations found by ALP outperform both in terms of privacy and utility a
set of static configurations manually fixed by a system designer.

 <dc:description>  Given a system model where machines have distinct speeds and power ratings
but are otherwise compatible, we consider various problems of scheduling under
resource constraints on the system which place the restriction that not all
machines can be run at once. These can be power, energy, or makespan
constraints on the system. Given such constraints, there are problems with
divisible as well as non-divisible jobs. In the setting where there is a
constraint on power, we show that the problem of minimizing makespan for a set
of divisible jobs is NP-hard by reduction to the knapsack problem. We then show
that scheduling to minimize energy with power constraints is also NP-hard. We
then consider scheduling with energy and makespan constraints with divisible
jobs and show that these can be solved in polynomial time, and the problems
with non-divisible jobs are NP-hard. We give exact and approximation algorithms
for these problems as required.

 <dc:description>  Directed graphs are widely used in modelling of nonsymmetric relations in
various sciences and engineering disciplines. We discuss invariants of strongly
connected directed graphs - minimal number of vertices or edges necessary to
remove to make remaining graphs not strongly connected. By analogy with
undirected graphs these invariants are called strong vertex/edge
connectivities. We review some properties of these invariants. Computational
results for some publicly available connectome graphs used in neuroscience are
described.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in biosensors technology and mobile electroencephalographic
(EEG) interfaces have opened new application fields for cognitive monitoring. A
computable biomarker for the assessment of spontaneous aesthetic brain
responses during music listening is introduced here. It derives from
well-established measures of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) and quantifies the
music-induced alterations in the dynamic relationships between brain rhythms.
During a stage of exploratory analysis, and using the signals from a suitably
designed experiment, we established the biomarker, which acts on brain
activations recorded over the left prefrontal cortex and focuses on the
functional coupling between high-beta and low-gamma oscillations. Based on data
from an additional experimental paradigm, we validated the introduced biomarker
and showed its relevance for expressing the subjective aesthetic appreciation
of a piece of music. Our approach resulted in an affordable tool that can
promote human-machine interaction and, by serving as a personalized music
annotation strategy, can be potentially integrated into modern flexible music
recommendation systems.

 <dc:description>  The secondary control in direct current microgrids (MGs) is used to restore
the voltage deviations caused by the primary droop control, where the latter is
implemented locally in each distributed generator and reacts to load
variations. Numerous recent works propose to implement the secondary control in
a distributed fashion, relying on a communication system to achieve consensus
among MG units. This paper shows that, if the system is not designed to cope
with adversary communication impairments, then a malicious attacker can apply a
simple jamming of a few units of the MG and thus compromise the secondary MG
control. Compared to other denial-of-service attacks that are oriented against
the tertiary control, such as economic dispatch, the attack on the secondary
control presented here can be more severe, as it disrupts the basic
functionality of the MG.

 <dc:description>  Image and texture synthesis is a challenging task that has long been drawing
attention in the fields of image processing, graphics, and machine learning.
This problem consists of modelling the desired type of images, either through
training examples or via a parametric modeling, and then generating images that
belong to the same statistical origin.
  This work addresses the image synthesis task, focusing on two specific
families of images -- handwritten digits and face images. This paper offers two
main contributions. First, we suggest a simple and intuitive algorithm capable
of generating such images in a unified way. The proposed approach taken is
pyramidal, consisting of upscaling and refining the estimated image several
times. For each upscaling stage, the algorithm randomly draws small patches
from a patch database, and merges these to form a coherent and novel image with
high visual quality. The second contribution is a general framework for the
evaluation of the generation performance, which combines three aspects: the
likelihood, the originality and the spread of the synthesized images. We assess
the proposed synthesis scheme and show that the results are similar in nature,
and yet different from the ones found in the training set, suggesting that true
synthesis effect has been obtained.

 <dc:description>  Valentine's face-space suggests that faces are represented in a psychological
multidimensional space according to their perceived properties. However, the
proposed framework was initially designed as an account of invariant facial
features only, and explanations for dynamic features representation were
neglected. In this paper we propose, develop and evaluate a computational model
for a twofold structure of the face-space, able to unify both identity and
expression representations in a single implemented model. To capture both
invariant and dynamic facial features we introduce the face-space duality
hypothesis and subsequently validate it through a mathematical presentation
using a general approach to dimensionality reduction. Two experiments with real
facial images show that the proposed face-space: (1) supports both identity and
expression recognition, and (2) has a twofold structure anticipated by our
formal argument.

 <dc:description>  We study and develop (stochastic) primal--dual block-coordinate descent
methods based on the method of Chambolle and Pock. Our methods have known
convergence rates for the iterates and the ergodic gap: $O(1/N^2)$ if each each
block is strongly convex, $O(1/N)$ if no convexity is present, and more
generally a mixed rate $O(1/N^2)+O(1/N)$ for strongly convex blocks, if only
some blocks are strongly convex. Additional novelties of our methods include
blockwise-adapted step lengths and acceleration, as well as the ability update
both the primal and dual variables randomly in blocks under a very light
compatibility condition. In other words, these variants of our methods are
doubly-stochastic. We test the proposed methods on various image processing
problems, where we employ pixelwise-adapted acceleration.

 <dc:description>  We study functional clones, which are sets of non-negative pseudo-Boolean
functions (functions $\{0,1\}^k\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$) closed under
(essentially) multiplication, summation and limits. Functional clones naturally
form a lattice under set inclusion and are closely related to counting
Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). We identify a sublattice of
interesting functional clones and investigate the relationships and properties
of the functional clones in this sublattice.

 <dc:description>  During hurricane seasons, emergency managers and other decision makers need
accurate and `on-time' information on potential storm surge impacts. Fully
dynamical computer models, such as the ADCIRC tide, storm surge, and wind-wave
model take several hours to complete a forecast when configured at high spatial
resolution. Additionally, statically meaningful ensembles of high-resolution
models (needed for uncertainty estimation) cannot easily be computed in near
real-time. This paper discusses an artificial neural network model for storm
surge prediction in North Carolina. The network model provides fast, real-time
storm surge estimates at coastal locations in North Carolina. The paper studies
the performance of the neural network model vs. other models on synthetic and
real hurricane data.

 <dc:description>  The presence of autonomous vehicles on the roads presents an opportunity to
compensate the unstable behaviour of conventional vehicles. Vehicles should (i)
be able to recover their equilibrium speed, and (ii) react so as not to
propagate but absorb perturbations. In this paper, we address the stability
analysis of platoon systems consisting of heterogeneous vehicles updating their
dynamics according to realistic behavioural car-following models. First,
definitions of all types of stability that are of interest in the platoon
system -asymptotic, input-output, weak and strict string stability- are
carefully presented based on recent studies. Then, frequency domain linear
stability analyses are conducted after linearisation of the modelled system of
vehicles. They lead to conditions for input-output stability, strict and weak
string stability over the behavioural parameters of the system, for finite and
infinite platoons of homogeneous and heterogeneous vehicles. This provides a
solid basis that was missing for car-following model-based control design in
mixed traffic environments. After visualisation of the theoretical results in
simulation, we formulate an optimisation strategy with LMI constraints to tune
the behavioural parameters of the (partially) autonomous vehicles in mixed and
heterogeneous traffic in order to maximise the stability of the traffic flow
while considering the comfort of autonomous driving. We show that very few
autonomous vehicles are enough to prevent the propagation of realistic
disturbances.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe approaches for discovering acoustic concepts and
relations in text. The first major goal is to be able to identify text phrases
which contain a notion of audibility and can be termed as a sound or an
acoustic concept. We also propose a method to define an acoustic scene through
a set of sound concepts. We use pattern matching and parts of speech tags to
generate sound concepts from large scale text corpora. We use dependency
parsing and LSTM recurrent neural network to predict a set of sound concepts
for a given acoustic scene. These methods are not only helpful in creating an
acoustic knowledge base but in the future can also directly help acoustic event
and scene detection research.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We extend the recently introduced regularization/Bayesian System
Identification procedures to the estimation of time-varying systems.
Specifically, we consider an online setting, in which new data become available
at given time steps. The real-time estimation requirements imposed by this
setting are met by estimating the hyper-parameters through just one gradient
step in the marginal likelihood maximization and by exploiting the closed-form
availability of the impulse response estimate (when Gaussian prior and Gaussian
measurement noise are postulated). By relying on the use of a forgetting
factor, we propose two methods to tackle the tracking of time-varying systems.
In one of them, the forgetting factor is estimated by treating it as a
hyper-parameter of the Bayesian inference procedure.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates formal logics for reasoning about determinacy and
independence. Propositional Dependence Logic D and Propositional Independence
Logic I are recently developed logical systems, based on team semantics, that
provide a framework for such reasoning tasks. We introduce two new logics L_D
and L_I, based on Kripke semantics, and propose them as alternatives for D and
I, respectively. We analyze the relative expressive powers of these four logics
and discuss the way these systems relate to natural language. We argue that L_D
and L_I naturally resolve a range of interpretational problems that arise in D
and I. We also obtain sound and complete axiomatizations for L_D and L_I.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of learning optimal policies for satisfying
signal temporal logic (STL) specifications by agents with unknown stochastic
dynamics. The system is modeled as a Markov decision process, in which the
states represent partitions of a continuous space and the transition
probabilities are unknown. We formulate two synthesis problems where the
desired STL specification is enforced by maximizing the probability of
satisfaction, and the expected robustness degree, that is, a measure
quantifying the quality of satisfaction. We discuss that Q-learning is not
directly applicable to these problems because, based on the quantitative
semantics of STL, the probability of satisfaction and expected robustness
degree are not in the standard objective form of Q-learning. To resolve this
issue, we propose an approximation of STL synthesis problems that can be solved
via Q-learning, and we derive some performance bounds for the policies obtained
by the approximate approach. The performance of the proposed method is
demonstrated via simulations.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of existence of unbiased constrained parameter
estimators. We show that if the constrained set of parameters is compact and
the hypothesized distributions are absolutely continuous with respect to one
another, then there exists no unbiased estimator. Weaker conditions for the
absence of unbiased constrained estimators are also specified. We provide
several examples which demonstrate the utility of these conditions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a method for real-time multi-person human pose
estimation from video by utilizing convolutional neural networks. Our method is
aimed for use case specific applications, where good accuracy is essential and
variation of the background and poses is limited. This enables us to use a
generic network architecture, which is both accurate and fast. We divide the
problem into two phases: (1) pre-training and (2) finetuning. In pre-training,
the network is learned with highly diverse input data from publicly available
datasets, while in finetuning we train with application specific data, which we
record with Kinect. Our method differs from most of the state-of-the-art
methods in that we consider the whole system, including person detector, pose
estimator and an automatic way to record application specific training material
for finetuning. Our method is considerably faster than many of the
state-of-the-art methods. Our method can be thought of as a replacement for
Kinect, and it can be used for higher level tasks, such as gesture control,
games, person tracking, action recognition and action tracking. We achieved
accuracy of 96.8\% (PCK@0.2) with application specific data.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers channel estimation and system performance for the uplink
of a single-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Each
receive antenna of the base station (BS) is assumed to be equipped with a pair
of one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to quantize the real and
imaginary part of the received signal. We first propose an approach for channel
estimation that is applicable for both flat and frequency-selective fading,
based on the Bussgang decomposition that reformulates the nonlinear quantizer
as a linear functionwith identical first- and second-order statistics. The
resulting channel estimator outperforms previously proposed approaches across
all SNRs. We then derive closed-form expressions for the achievable rate in
flat fading channels assuming low SNR and a large number of users for the
maximal ratio and zero forcing receivers that takes channel estimation error
due to both noise and one-bit quantization into account. The closed-form
expressions in turn allow us to obtain insight into important system design
issues such as optimal resource allocation, maximal sum spectral efficiency,
overall energy efficiency, and number of antennas. Numerical results are
presented to verify our analytical results and demonstrate the benefit of
optimizing system performance accordingly.

 <dc:description>  Fourier domain structured low-rank matrix priors are emerging as powerful
alternatives to traditional image recovery methods such as total variation and
wavelet regularization. These priors specify that a convolutional structured
matrix, i.e., Toeplitz, Hankel, or their multi-level generalizations, built
from Fourier data of the image should be low-rank. The main challenge in
applying these schemes to large-scale problems is the computational complexity
and memory demand resulting from lifting the image data to a large scale
matrix. We introduce a fast and memory efficient approach called the Generic
Iterative Reweighted Annihilation Filter (GIRAF) algorithm that exploits the
convolutional structure of the lifted matrix to work in the original un-lifted
domain, thus considerably reducing the complexity. Our experiments on the
recovery of images from undersampled Fourier measurements show that the
resulting algorithm is considerably faster than previously proposed algorithms,
and can accommodate much larger problem sizes than previously studied.

 <dc:description>  We present the first reinforcement-learning model to self-improve its
reward-modulated training implemented through a continuously improving
&quot;intuition&quot; neural network. An agent was trained how to play the arcade video
game Pong with two reward-based alternatives, one where the paddle was placed
randomly during training, and a second where the paddle was simultaneously
trained on three additional neural networks such that it could develop a sense
of &quot;certainty&quot; as to how probable its own predicted paddle position will be to
return the ball. If the agent was less than 95% certain to return the ball, the
policy used an intuition neural network to place the paddle. We trained both
architectures for an equivalent number of epochs and tested learning
performance by letting the trained programs play against a near-perfect
opponent. Through this, we found that the reinforcement learning model that
uses an intuition neural network for placing the paddle during reward training
quickly overtakes the simple architecture in its ability to outplay the
near-perfect opponent, additionally outscoring that opponent by an increasingly
wide margin after additional epochs of training.

particular, is the determination of the attitude angles. A novel method to
estimate these angles using off-the-shelf components is presented. This paper
introduces an \ac{AHRS} based on the \ac{UKF} using the \ac{TRIAD} algorithm as
the observation model. The performance of the method is assessed through
simulations and compared to an \ac{AHRS} based on the \ac{EKF}. The paper
presents field experiment results using a real fixed-wing \ac{UAV}. The results

 <dc:description>  Recently it has been reported that biased range-measurements among
neighboring agents in the gradient distance-based formation control can lead to
predictable collective motion. In this paper we take advantage of this effect
and by introducing distributed parameters to the prescribed inter-distances we
are able to manipulate the steady-state motion of the formation. This
manipulation is in the form of inducing simultaneously the combination of
constant translational and angular velocities and a controlled scaling of the
rigid formation. While the computation of the distributed parameters for the
translational and angular velocities is based on the well-known graph rigidity
theory, the parameters responsible for the scaling are based on some recent
findings in bearing rigidity theory. We carry out the stability analysis of the
modified gradient system and simulations in order to validate the main result.

 <dc:title>MPI Parallelization of the Resistive Wall Code STARWALL: Report of the

 <dc:description>  Large scale plasma instabilities inside a tokamak can be influenced by the
currents flowing in the conducting vessel wall. This involves non linear plasma
dynamics and its interaction with the wall current. In order to study this
problem the code that solves the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations, called
JOREK, was coupled with the model for the vacuum region and the resistive
conducting structure named STARWALL. The JOREK-STARWALL model has been already
applied to perform simulations of the Vertical Displacement Events (VDEs), the
Resistive Wall Modes (RWMs), and Quiescent H-Mode.
  At the beginning of the project it was not possible to resolve the realistic
wall structure with a large number of finite element triangles due to the huge
consumption of memory and wall clock time by STARWALL and the corresponding
coupling routine in JOREK. Moreover, both the STARWALL code and the JOREK
coupling routine are only partially parallelized via OpenMP. The aim of this
project is to implement an MPI parallelization in the model that should allow
to obtain realistic results with high resolution. This project concentrates on
the MPI parallelization of STARWALL. Parallel I/O and the MPI parallelization
of the coupling terms inside JOREK will be addressed in a follow-up project.

 <dc:title>Quasi-Monte Carlo for an Integrand with a Singularity along a Diagonal

 <dc:description>  Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are designed for integrands of bounded variation,
and this excludes singular integrands. Several methods are known for integrands
that become singular on the boundary of the unit cube $[0,1]^d$ or at isolated
possibly unknown points within $[0,1]^d$. Here we consider functions on the
square $[0,1]^2$ that may become singular as the point approaches the diagonal
line $x_1=x_2$, and we study three quadrature methods. The first method splits
the square into two triangles separated by a region around the line of
singularity, and applies recently developed triangle QMC rules to the two
triangular parts. For functions with a singularity `no worse than
$|x_1-x_2|^{-A}$ for $0&lt;A&lt;1$ that method yields an error of $O(
(\log(n)/n)^{(1-A)/2})$. We also consider methods extending the integrand into
a region containing the singularity and show that method will not improve up on
using two triangles. Finally, we consider transforming the integrand to have a
more QMC-friendly singularity along the boundary of the square. This then leads
to error rates of $O(n^{-1+\epsilon+A})$ when combined with some
corner-avoiding Halton points or with randomized QMC, but it requires some
stronger assumptions on the original singular integrand.

 <dc:description>  The participation of renewable energy sources in energy markets is
challenging, mainly because of the uncertainty associated with the renewables.
Aggregation of renewable energy suppliers is shown to be very effective in
decreasing this uncertainty. In the present paper, we propose a cost sharing
mechanism that entices the suppliers of wind, solar and other renewable
resources to form or join an aggregate. In particular, we consider the effect
of a bonus for surplus in supply, which is neglected in previous work. We
introduce a specific proportional cost sharing mechanism, which satisfies the
desired properties of such mechanisms that are introduced in the literature,
e.g., budget balancedness, ex-post individual rationality and fairness. In
addition, we show that the proposed mechanism results in a stable market
outcome. Finally, the results of the paper are illustrated by numerical
examples.

 <dc:description>  Given a weighted digraph D, finding the longest simple path is well known to
be NP-hard. Furthermore, even giving an approximation algorithm is known to be
NP-hard. In this paper we describe an efficient heuristic algorithm for finding
long simple paths, using an hybrid approach of DFS and pseudo-topological
orders, a a generalization of topological orders to non acyclic graphs, via a
process we call &quot;opening edges&quot;. An implementation of this algorithm won the
Oracle MDC 2015 coding competition.

 <dc:description>  The task of AMR-to-text generation is to generate grammatical text that
sustains the semantic meaning for a given AMR graph. We at- tack the task by
first partitioning the AMR graph into smaller fragments, and then generating
the translation for each fragment, before finally deciding the order by solving
an asymmetric generalized traveling salesman problem (AGTSP). A Maximum Entropy
classifier is trained to estimate the traveling costs, and a TSP solver is used
to find the optimized solution. The final model reports a BLEU score of 22.44
on the SemEval-2016 Task8 dataset.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Nowadays, several crowdsourcing projects exploit social choice methods for
computing an aggregate ranking of alternatives given individual rankings
provided by workers. Motivated by such systems, we consider a setting where
each worker is asked to rank a fixed (small) number of alternatives and, then,
a positional scoring rule is used to compute the aggregate ranking. Among the
apparently infinite such rules, what is the best one to use? To answer this
question, we assume that we have partial access to an underlying true ranking.
Then, the important optimization problem to be solved is to compute the
positional scoring rule whose outcome, when applied to the profile of
individual rankings, is as close as possible to the part of the underlying true
ranking we know. We study this fundamental problem from a theoretical viewpoint
and present positive and negative complexity results and, furthermore,
complement our theoretical findings with experiments on real-world and
synthetic data.

 <dc:description>  We propose a neural network approach to price EU call options that
significantly outperforms some existing pricing models and comes with
guarantees that its predictions are economically reasonable. To achieve this,
we introduce a class of gated neural networks that automatically learn to
divide-and-conquer the problem space for robust and accurate pricing. We then
derive instantiations of these networks that are 'rational by design' in terms
of naturally encoding a valid call option surface that enforces no arbitrage
principles. This integration of human insight within data-driven learning
provides significantly better generalisation in pricing performance due to the
encoded inductive bias in the learning, guarantees sanity in the model's
predictions, and provides econometrically useful byproduct such as risk neutral
density.

 <dc:description>  We present an upper bound on the exponent of the asymptotic behaviour of the
tensor rank of a family of tensors defined by the complete graph on $k$
vertices. For $k\geq4$, we show that the exponent per edge is at most 0.77,
outperforming the best known upper bound on the exponent per edge for matrix
multiplication ($k=3$), which is approximately 0.79. We raise the question
whether for some $k$ the exponent per edge can be below $2/3$, i.e. can
outperform matrix multiplication even if the matrix multiplication exponent
equals 2. In order to obtain our results, we generalise to higher order tensors
a result by Strassen on the asymptotic subrank of tight tensors and a result by
Coppersmith and Winograd on the asymptotic rank of matrix multiplication. Our
results have applications in entanglement theory and communication complexity.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new framework for deriving screening rules for convex
optimization problems. Our approach covers a large class of constrained and
penalized optimization formulations, and works in two steps. First, given any
approximate point, the structure of the objective function and the duality gap
is used to gather information on the optimal solution. In the second step, this
information is used to produce screening rules, i.e. safely identifying
unimportant weight variables of the optimal solution. Our general framework
leads to a large variety of useful existing as well as new screening rules for
many applications. For example, we provide new screening rules for general
simplex and $L_1$-constrained problems, Elastic Net, squared-loss Support
Vector Machines, minimum enclosing ball, as well as structured norm regularized
problems, such as group lasso.

 <dc:description>  Distantly supervised relation extraction has been widely used to find novel
relational facts from plain text. To predict the relation between a pair of two
target entities, existing methods solely rely on those direct sentences
containing both entities. In fact, there are also many sentences containing
only one of the target entities, which provide rich and useful information for
relation extraction. To address this issue, we build inference chains between
two target entities via intermediate entities, and propose a path-based neural
relation extraction model to encode the relational semantics from both direct
sentences and inference chains. Experimental results on real-world datasets
show that, our model can make full use of those sentences containing only one
target entity, and achieves significant and consistent improvements on relation
extraction as compared with baselines. The source code of this paper can be

 <dc:description>  The goal of this thesis is to investigate the potential of predictive
modelling for football injuries. This work was conducted in close collaboration
with Tottenham Hotspurs FC (THFC), the PGA European tour and the participation
of Wolverhampton Wanderers (WW).
  Three investigations were conducted:
  1. Predicting the recovery time of football injuries using the UEFA injury
recordings: The UEFA recordings is a common standard for recording injuries in
professional football. For this investigation, three datasets of UEFA injury
recordings were available. Different machine learning algorithms were used in
order to build a predictive model. The performance of the machine learning
models is then improved by using feature selection conducted through
correlation-based subset feature selection and random forests.
  2. Predicting injuries in professional football using exposure records: The
relationship between exposure (in training hours and match hours) in
professional football athletes and injury incidence was studied. A common
problem in football is understanding how the training schedule of an athlete
can affect the chance of him getting injured. The task was to predict the
number of days a player can train before he gets injured.
  3. Predicting intrinsic injury incidence using in-training GPS measurements:
A significant percentage of football injuries can be attributed to overtraining
and fatigue. GPS data collected during training sessions might provide
indicators of fatigue, or might be used to detect very intense training
sessions which can lead to overtraining. This research used GPS data gathered
during training sessions of the first team of THFC, in order to predict whether
an injury would take place during a week.

 <dc:description>  We tackle the problem of learning a rotation invariant latent factor model
when the training data is comprised of lower-dimensional projections of the
original feature space. The main goal is the discovery of a set of 3-D bases
poses that can characterize the manifold of primitive human motions, or
movemes, from a training set of 2-D projected poses obtained from still images
taken at various camera angles. The proposed technique for basis discovery is
data-driven rather than hand-designed. The learned representation is rotation
invariant, and can reconstruct any training instance from multiple viewing
angles. We apply our method to modeling human poses in sports (via the Leeds
Sports Dataset), and demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned bases in a
range of applications such as activity classification, inference of dynamics
from a single frame, and synthetic representation of movements.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents results on Speaker Recognition (SR) for children's
speech, using the OGI Kids corpus and GMM-UBM and GMM-SVM SR systems. Regions
of the spectrum containing important speaker information for children are
identified by conducting SR experiments over 21 frequency bands. As for adults,
the spectrum can be split into four regions, with the first (containing primary
vocal tract resonance information) and third (corresponding to high frequency
speech sounds) being most useful for SR. However, the frequencies at which
these regions occur are from 11% to 38% higher for children. It is also noted
that subband SR rates are lower for younger children. Finally results are
presented of SR experiments to identify a child in a class (30 children,
similar age) and school (288 children, varying ages). Class performance depends
on age, with accuracy varying from 90% for young children to 99% for older
children. The identification rate achieved for a child in a school is 81%.

 <dc:description>  The increased use of cryptography to protect our personal information makes
us want to understand the security of cryptosystems. The security of many
cryptosystems relies on solving the discrete logarithm, which is thought to be
relatively difficult. Therefore, we focus on the statistical analysis of
certain properties of the graph of the discrete logarithm. We discovered the
expected value and variance of a certain property of the graph and compared the
expected value to experimental data. Our finding did not coincide with our
intuition of the data following a Gaussian distribution given a large sample
size. Thus, we found the theoretical asymptotic distributions of certain
properties of the graph.

 <dc:title>Safety Certified Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control under Unreliable

 <dc:description>  Cooperative adaptive cruise control(CACC) system provides a great promise to
significantly reduce traffic congestion while maintaining a high level of
safety. Recent years have seen an increase of using formal methods in the
analysis and design of cooperative adaptive cruise control systems. However,
most existing results using formal methods usually assumed an ideal
inter-vehicle communication, which is far from the real world situation. Hence,
we are motivated to close the gap by explicitly considering non-deterministic
time delay and packet dropout due to unreliable inter-vehicle communications.
In particular, we consider a passive safety property, which requests a vehicle
to avoid any collisions that can be considered as its fault. Under the
assumption that the communication delay is bounded and we know the upper bound,
we then formally verify the passivity safety of a class of hybrid CACC systems.
This result allows us to define a safe control envelope that will guide the
synthesis of control signals. Vehicles under the CACC within the safe control
envelope are guaranteed to avoid active collisions.

 <dc:description>  In topological data analysis, a point cloud data P extracted from a metric
space is often analyzed by computing the persistence diagram or barcodes of a
sequence of Rips complexes built on $P$ indexed by a scale parameter.
Unfortunately, even for input of moderate size, the size of the Rips complex
may become prohibitively large as the scale parameter increases. Starting with
the Sparse Rips filtration introduced by Sheehy, some existing methods aim to
reduce the size of the complex so as to improve the time efficiency as well.
However, as we demonstrate, existing approaches still fall short of scaling
well, especially for high dimensional data. In this paper, we investigate the
advantages and limitations of existing approaches. Based on insights gained
from the experiments, we propose an efficient new algorithm, called SimBa, for
approximating the persistent homology of Rips filtrations with quality
guarantees. Our new algorithm leverages a batch collapse strategy as well as a
new sparse Rips-like filtration. We experiment on a variety of low and high
dimensional data sets. We show that our strategy presents a significant size
reduction, and our algorithm for approximating Rips filtration persistence is
order of magnitude faster than existing methods in practice.

 <dc:title>QUARKS: Identification of large-scale Kronecker Vector-AutoRegressive

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a Kronecker-based modeling of large networks with
unknown interconnection links. The class of Kronecker networks is defined for
which we formulate a Vector Autoregressive model. Its coefficient-matrices are
decomposed into a sum of Kronecker products. When the network is labeled such
that the number of terms in the sum is small compared to the size of the
matrix, exploiting this Kronecker structure leads to high data compression. Two
algorithms were designed for an efficient estimation of the
coefficient-matrices, namely a non-iterative and overparametrized algorithm as
well as an Alternating Least Squares minimization. We prove that the latter
always converges to the true parameters for non-zero initial conditions. This
framework moreover allows for a convenient integration of more structure (e.g
sparse, banded, Toeplitz) on smaller-size matrices. Numerical examples on
atmospheric turbulence data has shown comparable performances with the
unstructured least-squares estimation while the number of parameters is growing
only linearly w.r.t. the number of nodes instead of quadratically in the full
unstructured matrix case.

 <dc:description>  Mixture models and topic models generate each observation from a single
cluster, but standard variational posteriors for each observation assign
positive probability to all possible clusters. This requires dense storage and
runtime costs that scale with the total number of clusters, even though
typically only a few clusters have significant posterior mass for any data
point. We propose a constrained family of sparse variational distributions that
allow at most $L$ non-zero entries, where the tunable threshold $L$ trades off
speed for accuracy. Previous sparse approximations have used hard assignments
($L=1$), but we find that moderate values of $L&gt;1$ provide superior
performance. Our approach easily integrates with stochastic or incremental
optimization algorithms to scale to millions of examples. Experiments training
mixture models of image patches and topic models for news articles show that
our approach produces better-quality models in far less time than baseline
methods.

 <dc:description>  Information spreading in complex networks is often modeled as diffusing
information with certain probability from nodes that possess it to their
neighbors that do not. Information cascades are triggered when the activation
of a set of initial nodes (seeds) results in diffusion to large number of
nodes. Here, several novel approaches for seed initiation that replace the
commonly used activation of all seeds at once with a sequence of initiation
stages are introduced. Sequential strategies at later stages avoid seeding
highly ranked nodes that are already activated by diffusion active between
stages. The gain arises when a saved seed is allocated to a node difficult to
reach via diffusion. Sequential seeding and a single stage approach are
compared using various seed ranking methods and diffusion parameters on real
complex networks. The experimental results indicate that, regardless of the
seed ranking method used, sequential seeding strategies deliver better coverage
than single stage seeding in about 90% of cases. Longer seeding sequences tend
to activate more nodes but they also extend the duration of diffusion. Various
variants of sequential seeding resolve the trade-off between the coverage and
speed of diffusion differently.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the problem of determining $k$ anomalous random
variables that have different probability distributions from the rest $(n-k)$
random variables. Instead of sampling each individual random variable
separately as in the conventional hypothesis testing, we propose to perform
hypothesis testing using mixed observations that are functions of multiple
random variables. We characterize the error exponents for correctly identifying
the $k$ anomalous random variables under fixed time-invariant mixed
observations, random time-varying mixed observations, and deterministic
time-varying mixed observations. Our error exponent characterization is through
newly introduced notions of \emph{inner conditional Chernoff information} and
\emph{outer conditional Chernoff information}. It is demonstrated that mixed
observations can strictly improve the error exponents of hypothesis testing,
over separate observations of individual random variables. We further
characterize the optimal sensing vector maximizing the error exponents, which
lead to explicit constructions of the optimal mixed observations in special
cases of hypothesis testing for Gaussian random variables. These results show
that mixed observations of random variables can reduce the number of required
samples in hypothesis testing applications.

 <dc:description>  Our input is a bipartite graph $G = (A \cup B,E)$ where each vertex in $A
\cup B$ has a preference list strictly ranking its neighbors. The vertices in
$A$ and in $B$ are called students and courses, respectively. Each student $a$
seeks to be matched to $\mathsf{cap}(a) \ge 1$ courses while each course $b$
seeks $\mathsf{cap}(b) \ge 1$ many students to be matched to it. The
Gale-Shapley algorithm computes a pairwise-stable matching (one with no
blocking edge) in $G$ in linear time. We consider the problem of computing a
popular matching in $G$ -- a matching $M$ is popular if $M$ cannot lose an
election to any matching where vertices cast votes for one matching versus
another. Our main contribution is to show that a max-size popular matching in
$G$ can be computed by the 2-level Gale-Shapley algorithm in linear time. This
is an extension of the classical Gale-Shapley algorithm and we prove its
correctness via linear programming.

 <dc:title>Predictive and Self Triggering for Event-based State Estimation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Event-based state estimation can achieve estimation quality comparable to
traditional time-triggered methods, but with a significantly lower number of
samples. In networked estimation problems, this reduction in sampling instants
does, however, not necessarily translate into better usage of the shared
communication resource. Because typical event-based approaches decide
instantaneously whether communication is needed or not, free slots cannot be
reallocated immediately, and hence remain unused. In this paper, novel
predictive and self triggering protocols are proposed, which give the
communication system time to adapt and reallocate freed resources. From a
unified Bayesian decision framework, two schemes are developed: self-triggers
that predict, at the current triggering instant, the next one; and predictive
triggers that indicate, at every time step, whether communication will be
needed at a given prediction horizon. The effectiveness of the proposed
triggers in trading off estimation quality for communication reduction is
compared in numerical simulations.

 <dc:title>Alternative Form of Predictor Based Identification of LPV-SS Models with
  Innovation Noise</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cox, Pepijn B.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>T&#xf3;th, Roland</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present an approach to identify linear parameter-varying
(LPV) systems with a state-space (SS) model structure in an innovation form
where the coefficient functions have static and affine dependency on the
scheduling signal. With this scheme, the curse of dimensionality problem is
reduced, compared to existing predictor based LPV subspace identification
schemes. The investigated LPV-SS model is reformulated into an equivalent
impulse response form, which turns out to be a moving average with exogenous
inputs (MAX) system. The Markov coefficient functions of the LPV-MAX
representation are multi-linear in the scheduling signal and its time-shifts,
contrary to the predictor based schemes where the corresponding LPV
auto-regressive with exogenous inputs system is multi-quadratic in the
scheduling signal and its time-shifts. In this paper, we will prove that under
certain conditions on the input and scheduling signals, the $\ell_2$ loss
function of the one-step-ahead prediction error for the LPV-MAX model has only
one unique minimum, corresponding to the original underlying system. Hence,
identifying the LPV-MAX model in the prediction error minimization framework
will be consistent and unbiased. The LPV-SS model is realized by applying an
efficient basis reduced Ho-Kalman realization on the identified LPV-MAX model.
The performance of the proposed scheme is assessed on a Monte Carlo simulation
study.

 <dc:description>  We overview some results on distributed learning with focus on a family of
recently proposed algorithms known as non-Bayesian social learning. We consider
different approaches to the distributed learning problem and its algorithmic
solutions for the case of finitely many hypotheses. The original centralized
problem is discussed at first, and then followed by a generalization to the
distributed setting. The results on convergence and convergence rate are
presented for both asymptotic and finite time regimes. Various extensions are
discussed such as those dealing with directed time-varying networks, Nesterov's
acceleration technique and a continuum sets of hypothesis.

 <dc:description>  The staggering amount of streaming time series coming from the real world
calls for more efficient and effective online modeling solution. For time
series modeling, most existing works make some unrealistic assumptions such as
the input data is of fixed length or well aligned, which requires extra effort
on segmentation or normalization of the raw streaming data. Although some
literature claim their approaches to be invariant to data length and
misalignment, they are too time-consuming to model a streaming time series in
an online manner. We propose a novel and more practical online modeling and
classification scheme, DDE-MGM, which does not make any assumptions on the time
series while maintaining high efficiency and state-of-the-art performance. The
derivative delay embedding (DDE) is developed to incrementally transform time
series to the embedding space, where the intrinsic characteristics of data is
preserved as recursive patterns regardless of the stream length and
misalignment. Then, a non-parametric Markov geographic model (MGM) is proposed
to both model and classify the pattern in an online manner. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior classification accuracy of
the proposed DDE-MGM in an online setting as compared to the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  The potential of large tactile arrays to improve robot perception for safe
operation in human-dominated environments and of high-resolution tactile arrays
to enable human-level dexterous manipulation is well accepted. However, the
increase in the number of tactile sensing elements introduces challenges
including wiring complexity, power consumption, and data processing. To help
address these challenges, we previously developed a tactile sensing technique
based compressed sensing that reduces hardware complexity and data
transmission, while allowing accurate reconstruction of the full-resolution
signal. In this paper, we apply tactile compressed sensing to the problem of
object classification. Specifically, we perform object classification on the
compressed tactile data. We evaluate our method using BubbleTouch, our tactile
array simulator. Our results show our approach achieves high classification
accuracy, even with compression factors up to 64.

 <dc:description>  SciDB is a scalable, computational database management system that uses an
array model for data storage. The array data model of SciDB makes it ideally
suited for storing and managing large amounts of imaging data. SciDB is
designed to support advanced analytics in database, thus reducing the need for
extracting data for analysis. It is designed to be massively parallel and can
run on commodity hardware in a high performance computing (HPC) environment. In
this paper, we present the performance of SciDB using simulated image data. The
Dynamic Distributed Dimensional Data Model (D4M) software is used to implement
the benchmark on a cluster running the MIT SuperCloud software stack. A peak
performance of 2.2M database inserts per second was achieved on a single node
of this system. We also show that SciDB and the D4M toolbox provide more
efficient ways to access random sub-volumes of massive datasets compared to the
traditional approaches of reading volumetric data from individual files. This
work describes the D4M and SciDB tools we developed and presents the initial
performance results. This performance was achieved by using parallel inserts, a
in-database merging of arrays as well as supercomputing techniques, such as
distributed arrays and single-program-multiple-data programming.

 <dc:description>  Linearizability and progress properties are key correctness notions for
concurrent objects. However, model checking linearizability has suffered from
the PSPACE-hardness of the trace inclusion problem. This paper proposes to
exploit branching bisimulation, a fundamental semantic equivalence relation
developed for process algebras which can be computed efficiently, in checking
these properties. A quotient construction is provided which results in huge
state space reductions. We confirm the advantages of the proposed approach on
more than a dozen benchmark problems.

 <dc:description>  Organizations are often faced with the challenge of providing data management
solutions for large, heterogenous datasets that may have different underlying
data and programming models. For example, a medical dataset may have
unstructured text, relational data, time series waveforms and imagery. Trying
to fit such datasets in a single data management system can have adverse
performance and efficiency effects. As a part of the Intel Science and
Technology Center on Big Data, we are developing a polystore system designed
for such problems. BigDAWG (short for the Big Data Analytics Working Group) is
a polystore system designed to work on complex problems that naturally span
across different processing or storage engines. BigDAWG provides an
architecture that supports diverse database systems working with different data
models, support for the competing notions of location transparency and semantic
completeness via islands and a middleware that provides a uniform multi--island
interface. Initial results from a prototype of the BigDAWG system applied to a
medical dataset validate polystore concepts. In this article, we will describe
polystore databases, the current BigDAWG architecture and its application on
the MIMIC II medical dataset, initial performance results and our future
development plans.

 <dc:description>  A novel, information-based classification of elementary cellular automata is
proposed that circumvents the problems associated with isolating whether
complexity is in fact intrinsic to a dynamical rule, or if it arises merely as
a product of a complex initial state. Transfer entropy variations processed by
the system split the 256 elementary rules into three information classes, based
on sensitivity to initial conditions. These classes form a hierarchy such that
coarse-graining transitions observed among elementary cellular automata rules
predominately occur within each information- based class, or much more rarely,
down the hierarchy.

 <dc:description>  A big challenge in environmental monitoring is the spatiotemporal variation
of the phenomena to be observed. To enable persistent sensing and estimation in
such a setting, it is beneficial to have a time-varying underlying
environmental model. Here we present a planning and learning method that
enables an autonomous marine vehicle to perform persistent ocean monitoring
tasks by learning and refining an environmental model. To alleviate the
computational bottleneck caused by large-scale data accumulated, we propose a
framework that iterates between a planning component aimed at collecting the
most information-rich data, and a sparse Gaussian Process learning component
where the environmental model and hyperparameters are learned online by taking
advantage of only a subset of data that provides the greatest contribution. Our
simulations with ground-truth ocean data shows that the proposed method is both
accurate and efficient.

 <dc:description>  We introduce two first-order graph-based dependency parsers achieving a new
state of the art. The first is a consensus parser built from an ensemble of
independently trained greedy LSTM transition-based parsers with different
random initializations. We cast this approach as minimum Bayes risk decoding
(under the Hamming cost) and argue that weaker consensus within the ensemble is
a useful signal of difficulty or ambiguity. The second parser is a
&quot;distillation&quot; of the ensemble into a single model. We train the distillation
parser using a structured hinge loss objective with a novel cost that
incorporates ensemble uncertainty estimates for each possible attachment,
thereby avoiding the intractable cross-entropy computations required by
applying standard distillation objectives to problems with structured outputs.
The first-order distillation parser matches or surpasses the state of the art
on English, Chinese, and German.

 <dc:description>  Discriminating between closely-related language varieties is considered a
challenging and important task. This paper describes our submission to the DSL
2016 shared-task, which included two sub-tasks: one on discriminating similar
languages and one on identifying Arabic dialects. We developed a
character-level neural network for this task. Given a sequence of characters,
our model embeds each character in vector space, runs the sequence through
multiple convolutions with different filter widths, and pools the convolutional
representations to obtain a hidden vector representation of the text that is
used for predicting the language or dialect. We primarily focused on the Arabic
dialect identification task and obtained an F1 score of 0.4834, ranking 6th out
of 18 participants. We also analyze errors made by our system on the Arabic
data in some detail, and point to challenges such an approach is faced with.

 <dc:description>  We study the pricing problem faced by a firm that sells a large number of
products, described via a wide range of features, to customers that arrive over
time. Customers independently make purchasing decisions according to a general
choice model that includes products features and customers' characteristics,
encoded as $d$-dimensional numerical vectors, as well as the price offered. The
parameters of the choice model are a priori unknown to the firm, but can be
learned as the (binary-valued) sales data accrues over time. The firm's
objective is to minimize the regret, i.e., the expected revenue loss against a
clairvoyant policy that knows the parameters of the choice model in advance,
and always offers the revenue-maximizing price. This setting is motivated in
part by the prevalence of online marketplaces that allow for real-time pricing.
We assume a structured choice model, parameters of which depend on $s_0$ out of
the $d$ product features. We propose a dynamic policy, called Regularized
Maximum Likelihood Pricing (RMLP) that leverages the (sparsity) structure of
the high-dimensional model and obtains a logarithmic regret in $T$. More
specifically, the regret of our algorithm is of $O(s_0 \log d \cdot \log T)$.
Furthermore, we show that no policy can obtain regret better than $O(s_0 (\log
d + \log T))$.

 <dc:title>Incentivizing Energy Trading for Interconnected Microgrids</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the interactions among interconnected autonomous
microgrids, and propose a joint energy trading and scheduling strategy. Each
interconnected microgrid not only schedules its local power supply and demand,
but also trades energy with other microgrids in a distribution network.
Specifically, microgrids with excessive renewable generations can trade with
other microgrids in deficit of power supplies for mutual benefits. Since
interconnected microgrids operate autonomously, they aim to optimize their own
performance and expect to gain benefits through energy trading. We design an
incentive mechanism using Nash bargaining theory to encourage proactive energy
trading and fair benefit sharing. We solve the bargaining problem by
decomposing it into two sequential problems on social cost minimization and
trading benefit sharing, respectively. For practical implementation, we propose
a decentralized solution method with minimum information exchange overhead.
Numerical studies based on realistic data demonstrate that the total cost of
the interconnected-microgrids operation can be reduced by up to 13.2% through
energy trading, and an individual participating microgrid can achieve up to
29.4% reduction in its cost through energy trading.

 <dc:description>  The recent years have witnessed increased development of small, autonomous
fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In order to unlock widespread
applicability of these platforms, they need to be capable of operating under a
variety of environmental conditions. Due to their small size, low weight, and
low speeds, they require the capability of coping with wind speeds that are
approaching or even faster than the nominal airspeed. In this paper we present
a principled nonlinear guidance strategy, addressing this problem. More
broadly, we propose a methodology for the high-level control of non-holonomic
unicycle-like vehicles in the presence of strong flowfields (e.g. winds,
underwater currents) which may outreach the maximum vehicle speed. The proposed
strategy guarantees convergence to a safe and stable vehicle configuration with
respect to the flowfield, while preserving some tracking performance with
respect to the target path. Evaluations in simulations and a challenging
real-world flight experiment in very windy conditions confirm the feasibility
of the proposed guidance approach.

 <dc:title>Classification of infrastructure networks by neighborhood degree

 <dc:description>  A common way of classifying network connectivity is the association of the
nodal degree distribution to specific probability distribution models. During
the last decades, researchers classified many networks using the Poisson or
Pareto distributions. Urban infrastructures, like transportation (railways,
roads, etc.) and distribution (gas, water, energy, etc.) systems, are peculiar
networks strongly constrained by spatial characteristics of the environment
where they are constructed. Consequently, the nodal degree of such networks
spans very small ranges not allowing a reliable classification using the nodal
degree distribution. In order to overcome this problem, we here (i) define the
neighborhood degree, equal to the sum of the nodal degrees of the nearest
topological neighbors, the adjacent nodes and (ii) propose to use neighborhood
degree to classify infrastructure networks. Such neighborhood degree spans a
wider range of degrees than the standard one allowing inferring the
probabilistic model in a more reliable way, from a statistical standpoint. In
order to test our proposal, we here analyze twenty-two real water distribution
networks, built in different environments, demonstrating that the Poisson
distribution generally models very well their neighborhood degree
distributions. This result seems consistent with the less reliable
classification achievable with the scarce information using the standard nodal
degree distribution.

 <dc:description>  Drug name recognition (DNR) is an essential step in the Pharmacovigilance
(PV) pipeline. DNR aims to find drug name mentions in unstructured biomedical
texts and classify them into predefined categories. State-of-the-art DNR
approaches heavily rely on hand crafted features and domain specific resources
which are difficult to collect and tune. For this reason, this paper
investigates the effectiveness of contemporary recurrent neural architectures -
the Elman and Jordan networks and the bidirectional LSTM with CRF decoding - at
performing DNR straight from the text. The experimental results achieved on the
authoritative SemEval-2013 Task 9.1 benchmarks show that the bidirectional
LSTM-CRF ranks closely to highly-dedicated, hand-crafted systems.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new achievability scheme, termed opportunistic network
decoupling (OND), operating in virtual full-duplex mode. In the scheme, a novel
relay scheduling strategy is utilized in the $K\times N\times K$ channel with
interfering relays, consisting of $K$ source--destination pairs and $N$
half-duplex relays in-between them. A subset of relays using alternate relaying
is opportunistically selected in terms of producing the minimum total
interference level, thereby resulting in network decoupling. As our main
result, it is shown that under a certain relay scaling condition, the OND
protocol achieves $K$ degrees of freedom even in the presence of interfering
links among relays. Numerical evaluation is also shown to validate the
performance of the proposed OND. Our protocol basically operates in a fully
distributed fashion along with local channel state information, thereby
resulting in a relatively easy implementation.

 <dc:description>  This paper is concerned with coherent quantum linear quadratic Gaussian
(CQLQG) control. The problem is to find a stabilizing measurement-free quantum
controller for a quantum plant so as to minimize a mean square cost for the
fully quantum closed-loop system. The plant and controller are open quantum
systems interconnected through bosonic quantum fields. In comparison with the
observation-actuation structure of classical controllers, coherent quantum
feedback is less invasive to the quantum dynamics. The plant and controller
variables satisfy the canonical commutation relations (CCRs) of a quantum
harmonic oscillator and are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential
equations (QSDEs). In order to correspond to such oscillators, these QSDEs must
satisfy physical realizability (PR) conditions in the form of quadratic
constraints on the state-space matrices, reflecting the CCR preservation in
time. The symmetry of the problem is taken into account by introducing
equivalence classes of coherent quantum controllers generated by symplectic
similarity transformations. We discuss a modified gradient flow, which is
concerned with norm-balanced realizations of controllers. A line-search
gradient descent algorithm with adaptive stepsize selection is proposed for the
numerical solution of the CQLQG control problem. The algorithm finds a local
minimum of the LQG cost over the parameters of the Hamiltonian and coupling
operators of a stabilizing coherent quantum controller, thus taking the PR
constraints into account. A convergence analysis of the algorithm is presented.
Numerical examples of designing locally optimal CQLQG controllers are provided
in order to demonstrate the algorithm performance.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances have been made in learning of grasps for fully actuated
hands. A typical approach learns the target locations of finger links on the
object. When a new object must be grasped, new finger locations are generated,
and a collision free reach-to-grasp trajectory is planned. This assumes a
collision free trajectory to the final grasp. This is not possible with
underactuated hands, which cannot be guaranteed to avoid contact, and in fact
exploit contacts with the object during grasping, so as to reach an equilibrium
state in which the object is held securely. Unfortunately, these contact
interactions are i) not directly controllable, and ii) hard to monitor during a
real grasp. We overcome these problems so as to permit learning of
transferrable grasps for underactuated hands. We make two main technical
innovations. First, we model contact interactions during the grasp implicitly.
We do this by modelling motor commands that lead reliably to the equilibrium
state, rather than modelling contact changes themselves. This alters our
reach-to-grasp model. Second, we extend our contact model learning algorithm to
work with multiple training examples for each grasp type. This requires the
ability to learn which parts of the hand reliably interact with the object
during a particular grasp. Our approach learns from a rigid body simulation.
This enables us to learn how to approach the object and close the underactuated
hand from a variety of poses. From nine training grasps on three objects the
method transferred grasps to previously unseen, novel objects, that differ
significantly from the training objects, with an 80% success rate.

 <dc:description>  We consider combinatorial aspects of $\lambda$-terms in the model based on de
Bruijn indices where each building constructor is of size one. Surprisingly,
the counting sequence for $\lambda$-terms corresponds also to two families of
binary trees, namely black-white trees and zigzag-free ones. We provide a
constructive proof of this fact by exhibiting appropriate bijections. Moreover,
we identify the sequence of Motzkin numbers with the counting sequence for
neutral $\lambda$-terms, giving a bijection which, in consequence, results in
an exact-size sampler for the latter based on the exact-size sampler for
Motzkin trees of Bodini et alli. Using the powerful theory of analytic
combinatorics, we state several results concerning the asymptotic growth rate
of $\lambda$-terms in neutral, normal, and head normal forms. Finally, we
investigate the asymptotic density of $\lambda$-terms containing arbitrary
fixed subterms showing that, inter alia, strongly normalising or typeable terms
are asymptotically negligible in the set of all $\lambda$-terms.

 <dc:description>  Single feature is inefficient to describe content of an image, which is a
shortcoming in traditional image retrieval task. We know that one image can be
described by different features. Multi-feature fusion ranking can be utilized
to improve the ranking list of query. In this paper, we first analyze graph
structure and multi-feature fusion re-ranking from manifold aspect. Then, Three
Tiers Neighborhood Graph (TTNG) is constructed to re-rank the original ranking
list by single feature and to enhance precision of single feature. Furthermore,
we propose Multi-graph Fusion Ranking (MFR) for multi-feature ranking, which
considers the correlation of all images in multiple neighborhood graphs.
Evaluations are conducted on UK-bench, Corel-1K, Corel-10K and Cifar-10
benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that our TTNG and MFR
outperform than other state-of-the-art methods. For example, we achieve
competitive results N-S score 3.91 and precision 65.00% on UK-bench and
Corel-10K datasets respectively.

 <dc:description>  With an exponentially increasing usage of cloud services, the need for
forensic investigations of virtual space is equally in constantly increasing
demand, which includes as a very first approach, the gaining of access to it as
well as the data stored. This is an aspect that faces a number of challenges,
stemming not only from the technical difficulties and peculiarities, but
equally covers the interaction with an emerging line of businesses offering
cloud storage and services. Beyond the forensic aspects, it also covers to an
ever increasing amount the non-forensic considerations, such as the
availability of logs and archives, legal and data protection considerations
from a global perspective and the clashes in between, as well as the ever
competing interests between law enforcement to seize evidence which is
non-physical, and businesses who need to be able to continue to operate and
provide their hosted services, even if law enforcement seek to collect
evidence. The trend post-Snowden has been unequivocally towards default
encryption, and driven by market leaders such as Apple, motivated to a large
extent by the perceived demands for privacy of the consumer. The central
question to be explored in this paper is to what extent this trend towards
default encryption will have a negative impact on law enforcement
investigations and possibilities, and will at the end attempt to provide a
solution, which takes into account the needs of both law enforcement, but also
of the service providers. It is hoped that the recommendations from this paper
will be able to have an impact in the ability for law enforcement to continue
with their investigations in an efficient manner, whilst also safeguarding the
ability for business to thrive and continue to develop and offer new and
innovative solutions, which do not put law enforcement at risk.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a large-scale strip adjustment method for LiDAR mobile
mapping data, yielding highly precise maps. It uses several concepts to achieve
scalability. First, an efficient graph-based pre-segmentation is used, which
directly operates on LiDAR scan strip data, rather than on point clouds.
Second, observation equations are obtained from a dense matching, which is
formulated in terms of an estimation of a latent map. As a result of this
formulation, the number of observation equations is not quadratic, but rather
linear in the number of scan strips. Third, the dynamic Bayes network, which
results from all observation and condition equations, is partitioned into two
sub-networks. Consequently, the estimation matrices for all position and
orientation corrections are linear instead of quadratic in the number of
unknowns and can be solved very efficiently using an alternating least squares
approach. It is shown how this approach can be mapped to a standard key/value
MapReduce implementation, where each of the processing nodes operates
independently on small chunks of data, leading to essentially linear
scalability. Results are demonstrated for a dataset of one billion measured
LiDAR points and 278,000 unknowns, leading to maps with a precision of a few
millimeters.

 <dc:title>Obfuscating Keystroke Time Intervals to Avoid Identification and
  Impersonation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There are numerous opportunities for adversaries to observe user behavior
remotely on the web. Additionally, keystroke biometric algorithms have advanced
to the point where user identification and soft biometric trait recognition
rates are commercially viable. This presents a privacy concern because masking
spatial information, such as IP address, is not sufficient as users become more
identifiable by their behavior. In this work, the well-known Chaum mix is
generalized to a scenario in which users are separated by both space and time
with the goal of preventing an observing adversary from identifying or
impersonating the user. The criteria of a behavior obfuscation strategy are
defined and two strategies are introduced for obfuscating typing behavior.
Experimental results are obtained using publicly available keystroke data for
three different types of input, including short fixed-text, long fixed-text,
and long free-text. Identification accuracy is reduced by 20% with a 25 ms
random keystroke delay not noticeable to the user.

 <dc:description>  Incompatibility of image descriptor and ranking is always neglected in image
retrieval. In this paper, manifold learning and Gestalt psychology theory are
involved to solve the incompatibility problem. A new holistic descriptor called
Perceptual Uniform Descriptor (PUD) based on Gestalt psychology is proposed,
which combines color and gradient direction to imitate the human visual
uniformity. PUD features in the same class images distributes on one manifold
in most cases because PUD improves the visual uniformity of the traditional
descriptors. Thus, we use manifold ranking and PUD to realize image retrieval.
Experiments were carried out on five benchmark data sets, and the proposed
method can greatly improve the accuracy of image retrieval. Our experimental
results in the Ukbench and Corel-1K datasets demonstrated that N-S score
reached to 3.58 (HSV 3.4) and mAP to 81.77% (ODBTC 77.9%) respectively by
utilizing PUD which has only 280 dimension. The results are higher than other
holistic image descriptors (even some local ones) and state-of-the-arts
retrieval methods.

 <dc:description>  The usage of linear transformations has great relevance for data
decorrelation applications, like image and video compression. In that sense,
the discrete Tchebichef transform (DTT) possesses useful coding and
decorrelation properties. The DTT transform kernel does not depend on the input
data and fast algorithms can be developed to real time applications. However,
the DTT fast algorithm presented in literature possess high computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce a new low-complexity approximation for
the DTT. The fast algorithm of the proposed transform is multiplication-free
and requires a reduced number of additions and bit-shifting operations. Image
and video compression simulations in popular standards shows good performance
of the proposed transform. Regarding hardware resource consumption for FPGA
shows 43.1% reduction of configurable logic blocks and ASIC place and route
realization shows 57.7% reduction in the area-time figure when compared with
the 2-D version of the exact DTT.

 <dc:description>  While several paths have emerged in microelectronics and computing as
follow-ons to Turing architectures, and have been implemented using essentially
silicon circuits, very little beyond Moore research has considered: (1) first
biological processes instead of sequential instructions, and, (2) the
implementation of these processes exploiting particle physics interactions.
This last combination enables native spatial-temporal integration and
correlation, but also powerful interference filtering, gating, splitting and
more. These biological functions, their realization by quantum and charge
carrier interactions, allow proposing a novel computing architecture, with
interfaces, information storage, and programmability. The paper presents the
underlying biological processes, the particle physics phenomena which are
exploited, and the proposed architecture, as well as an algebraic design
formalism.

 <dc:description>  The success of Wi-Fi technology as an efficient and low-cost last-mile access
solution has enabled massive spontaneous deployments generating storms of
beacons all across the globe. Emerging location systems are using these beacons
to observe mobility patterns of people through portable or wearable devices and
offers promising use-cases that can help to solve critical problems in the
developing world. In this paper, we design and develop a novel prototype to
organise these spontaneous deployments of Access Points into what we call
virtual cells (vcells). We compute virtual cells from a list of Access Points
collected from different active scans for a geographical region. We argue that
virtual cells can be encoded using Bloom filters to implement the location
process. Lastly, we present two illustrative use-cases to showcase the
suitability and challenges of the technique.

 <dc:title>Popularity in the generalized Hospital Residents Setting</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of computing popular matchings in a bipartite graph G
= (R U H, E) where R and H denote a set of residents and a set of hospitals
respectively. Each hospital h has a positive capacity denoting the number of
residents that can be matched to h. The residents and the hospitals specify
strict preferences over each other. This is the well-studied Hospital Residents
(HR) problem which is a generalization of the Stable Marriage (SM) problem. The
goal is to assign residents to hospitals optimally while respecting the
capacities of the hospitals. Stability is a well-accepted notion of optimality
in such problems. However, motivated by the need for larger cardinality
matchings, alternative notions of optimality like popularity have been
investigated in the SM setting. In this paper, we consider a generalized HR
setting -- namely the Laminar Classified Stable Matchings (LCSM+) problem.
Here, additionally, hospitals can specify classifications over residents in
their preference lists and classes have upper quotas. We show the following new
results: We define a notion of popularity and give a structural
characterization of popular matchings for the LCSM+ problem. Assume n = |R| +
|H| and m = |E|. We give an O(mn) time algorithm for computing a maximum
cardinality popular matching in an LCSM+ instance. We give an O(mn^2) time
algorithm for computing a matching that is popular amongst the maximum
cardinality matchings in an LCSM+ instance.

 <dc:description>  The concept of well-rounded lattices has recently found important
applications in the setting of a fading single-input single-output (SISO)
wiretap channel. It has been shown that, under this setup, the property of
being well-rounded is critical for minimizing the eavesdropper's probability of
correct decoding in lower SNR regimes. The superior performance of coset codes
constructed from well-rounded lattices has been illustrated in several
simulations.
  In the present article, this work is extended to fading multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channels, and similar design criteria as in the
SISO case are derived. Further, explicit coset codes for Rayleigh fading MIMO
wiretap channels are designed. In particular, it is shown through extensive
simulations that sublattices of the well-known Alamouti code and Golden code
which meet our design criteria perform better than scalar multiples of the code
lattice for the same parameters.

 <dc:description>  Bounded agents are limited by intrinsic constraints on their ability to
process information that is available in their sensors and memory and choose
actions and memory updates. In this dissertation, we model these constraints as
information-rate constraints on communication channels connecting these various
internal components of the agent. We make four major contributions detailed
below and many smaller contributions detailed in each section. First, we
formulate the problem of optimizing the agent under both extrinsic and
intrinsic constraints and develop the main tools for solving it. Second, we
identify another reason for the challenging convergence properties of the
optimization algorithm, which is the bifurcation structure of the update
operator near phase transitions. Third, we study the special case of
linear-Gaussian dynamics and quadratic cost (LQG), where the optimal solution
has a particularly simple and solvable form. Fourth, we explore the learning
task, where the model of the world dynamics is unknown and sample-based updates
are used instead.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe a method for packing tubes and boxes in containers.
Each container is divided into parts (holders) which are allocated to subsets
of objects. The method consists of a recursive procedure which, based on a
predefined order for dealing with tubes and boxes, determines the dimensions
and position of each holder. Characteristics of the objects to pack and rules
limiting their placement make this problem unique. The method devised provides
timely and practical solutions.

 <dc:description>  The power law is ubiquitous in natural and social phenomena, and is
considered as a universal relationship between the frequency and its rank for
diverse social systems. However, a general model is still lacking to interpret
why these seemingly unrelated systems share great similarity. Through a
detailed analysis of natural language texts and simulation experiments based on
the proposed 'Hierarchical Selection Model', we found that the existence of
hierarchies and human's pursuit of top hierarchy lead to the power law.
Further, the power law is a statistical and emergent performance of
hierarchies, and it is the universality of hierarchies that contributes to the
ubiquity of the power law.

 <dc:description>  Sentence is a basic linguistic unit, however, little is known about how
information content is distributed across different positions of a sentence.
Based on authentic language data of English, the present study calculated the
entropy and other entropy-related statistics for different sentence positions.
The statistics indicate a three-step staircase-shaped distribution pattern,
with entropy in the initial position lower than the medial positions (positions
other than the initial and final), the medial positions lower than the final
position and the medial positions showing no significant difference. The
results suggest that: (1) the hypotheses of Constant Entropy Rate and Uniform
Information Density do not hold for the sentence-medial positions; (2) the
context of a word in a sentence should not be simply defined as all the words
preceding it in the same sentence; and (3) the contextual information content
in a sentence does not accumulate incrementally but follows a pattern of &quot;the
whole is greater than the sum of parts&quot;.

 <dc:title>Axiomatization and complexity of modal logic with knowing-what operator
  on model class K</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ding, Yifeng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Standard epistemic logic studies propositional knowledge, yet many other
types of knowledge such as &quot;knowing whether&quot;, &quot;knowing what&quot;, &quot;knowing how&quot; are
frequently and widely used in everyday life as well as academic fields. In
&quot;Conditionally Knowing What&quot; by Wang and Fan, an axiomatization of the
epistemic logic with both regular &quot;knowing that&quot; operator and &quot;conditionally
knowing what&quot; operator is given. Then the decidability and complexity of this
logic command our study. In this paper, we direct our attention to the
arbitrary models instead of epistemic models, thus making things clearer, and
then give a axiomatization and a tableau for the modal logic with same
operators on arbitrary Kripke models. Given the tableau of this logic, the
complexity of the satisfiability problem of this logic is PSPACE-complete.

 <dc:title>Structure Based Aesthetics and Support of Cognitive Tasks for Graph
  Evaluation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Weidong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Drawing principles, or aesthetics, are important in graph drawing. They are
used as criteria for algorithm design and for quality evaluation. Current
aesthetics are described as visual properties that a drawing is required to
have to be visually pleasing. However, most of these aesthetics are originally
proposed without consideration of graph structure information. Therefore their
ability in visually revealing graph structural features are not guaranteed and
indeed mixed results have been reported in the literature regarding their
impact on user graph comprehension. In this paper, we propose to derive
aesthetics based on graph internal structural features. Further, graphs are
often evaluated based on controlled experiments with simple perception tasks to
avoid possible confounding factors caused by complex tasks. This leaves their
value in supporting complex tasks unevaluated. To fill this gap, we also
discuss the possibility of applying evaluation methodologies used in the
Cognitive Load Theory research for graph evaluation.

 <dc:title>Coverage and Field Estimation on Bounded Domains by Diffusive Swarms</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider stochastic coverage of bounded domains by a
diffusing swarm of robots that take local measurements of an underlying scalar
field. We introduce three control methodologies with diffusion, advection, and
reaction as independent control inputs. We analyze the diffusion-based control
strategy using standard operator semigroup-theoretic arguments. We show that
the diffusion coefficient can be chosen to be dependent only on the robots'
local measurements to ensure that the swarm density converges to a function
proportional to the scalar field. The boundedness of the domain precludes the
need to impose assumptions on decaying properties of the scalar field at
infinity. Moreover, exponential convergence of the swarm density to the
equilibrium follows from properties of the spectrum of the semigroup generator.
In addition, we use the proposed coverage method to construct a
time-inhomogenous diffusion process and apply the observability of the heat
equation to reconstruct the scalar field over the entire domain from
observations of the robots' random motion over a small subset of the domain. We
verify our results through simulations of the coverage scenario on a 2D domain
and the field estimation scenario on a 1D domain.

 <dc:description>  Machine translation between Arabic and Hebrew has so far been limited by a
lack of parallel corpora, despite the political and cultural importance of this
language pair. Previous work relied on manually-crafted grammars or pivoting
via English, both of which are unsatisfactory for building a scalable and
accurate MT system. In this work, we compare standard phrase-based and neural
systems on Arabic-Hebrew translation. We experiment with tokenization by
external tools and sub-word modeling by character-level neural models, and show
that both methods lead to improved translation performance, with a small
advantage to the neural models.

 <dc:description>  Learning based on networks of real neurons, and by extension biologically
inspired models of neural networks, has yet to find general learning rules
leading to widespread applications. In this paper, we argue for the existence
of a principle allowing to steer the dynamics of a biologically inspired neural
network. Using carefully timed external stimulation, the network can be driven
towards a desired dynamical state. We term this principle &quot;Learning by
Stimulation Avoidance&quot; (LSA). We demonstrate through simulation that the
minimal sufficient conditions leading to LSA in artificial networks are also
sufficient to reproduce learning results similar to those obtained in
biological neurons by Shahaf and Marom [1]. We examine the mechanism's basic
dynamics in a reduced network, and demonstrate how it scales up to a network of
100 neurons. We show that LSA has a higher explanatory power than existing
hypotheses about the response of biological neural networks to external
simulation, and can be used as a learning rule for an embodied application:
learning of wall avoidance by a simulated robot. The surge in popularity of
artificial neural networks is mostly directed to disembodied models of neurons
with biologically irrelevant dynamics: to the authors' knowledge, this is the
first work demonstrating sensory-motor learning with random spiking networks
through pure Hebbian learning.

 <dc:description>  Let $H$ be a set of $n$ halfplanes in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in general position, and
let $k&lt;n$ be a given parameter. We show that the number of vertices of the
arrangement of $H$ that lie at depth exactly $k$ (i.e., that are contained in

n^{2/3}k^{4/3})$. The bound is tight when $k=\Theta(n)$. This generalizes the

 <dc:title>Performance Impact of Idle Mode Capability on Dense Small Cell Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Very recent studies showed that in a fully loaded dense small cell network
(SCN), the coverage probability performance will continuously decrease with the
network densification. Such new results were captured in IEEE ComSoc Technology
News with an alarming title of &quot;Will Densification Be the Death of 5G?&quot;. In
this paper, we revisit this issue from more practical views of realistic
network deployment, such as a finite number of active base stations (BSs) and
user equipments (UEs), a decreasing BS transmission power with the network
densification, etc. Particularly, in dense SCNs, due to an oversupply of BSs
with respect to UEs, a large number of BSs can be put into idle modes without
signal transmission, if there is no active UE within their coverage areas.
Setting those BSs into idle modes mitigates unnecessary inter-cell interference
and reduces energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate the performance
impact of such BS idle mode capability (IMC) on dense SCNs. Different from
existing work, we consider a realistic path loss model incorporating both
line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions. Moreover, we
obtain analytical results for the coverage probability, the area spectral
efficiency (ASE) and the energy efficiency (EE) performance for SCNs with the
BS IMC and show that the performance impact of the IMC on dense SCNs is
significant. As the BS density surpasses the UE density in dense SCNs, the
coverage probability will continuously increase toward one, addressing previous
concerns on &quot;the death of 5G&quot;. Finally, the performance improvement in terms of
the EE performance is also investigated for dense SCNs using practical energy
models developed in the Green-Touch project.

 <dc:description>  A multi-user cognitive (secondary) radio system is considered, where the
spatial multiplexing mode of operation is implemented amongst the nodes, under
the presence of multiple primary transmissions. The secondary receiver carries
out minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) detection to effectively decode the
secondary data streams, while it performs spectrum sensing at the remaining
signal to capture the presence of primary activity or not. New analytical
closed-form expressions regarding some important system measures are obtained,
namely, the outage and detection probabilities; the transmission power of the
secondary nodes; the probability of unexpected interference at the primary
nodes; {\color{blue}and the detection efficiency with the aid of the area under
the receive operating characteristics curve}. The realistic scenarios of
channel fading time variation and channel estimation errors are encountered for
the derived results. Finally, the enclosed numerical results verify the
accuracy of the proposed framework, while some useful engineering insights are
also revealed, such as the key role of the detection accuracy to the overall
performance and the impact of transmission power from the secondary nodes to
the primary system.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things (IoT), which enables common objects to be intelligent
and interactive, is considered the next evolution of the Internet. Its
pervasiveness and abilities to collect and analyze data which can be converted
into information have motivated a plethora of IoT applications. For the
successful deployment and management of these applications, cloud computing
techniques are indispensable since they provide high computational capabilities
as well as large storage capacity. This paper aims at providing insights about
the architecture, implementation and performance of the IoT cloud. Several
potential application scenarios of IoT cloud are studied, and an architecture
is discussed regarding the functionality of each component. Moreover, the
implementation details of the IoT cloud are presented along with the services
that it offers. The main contributions of this paper lie in the combination of
the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
(MQTT) servers to offer IoT services in the architecture of the IoT cloud with
various techniques to guarantee high performance. Finally, experimental results
are given in order to demonstrate the service capabilities of the IoT cloud
under certain conditions.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of controlling an unstable plant over an additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with a transmit power constraint, where the
signaling rate of communication is larger than the sampling rate (for
generating observations and applying control inputs) of the underlying plant.
Such a situation is quite common since sampling is done at a rate that captures
the dynamics of the plant and which is often much lower than the rate that can
be communicated. This setting offers the opportunity of improving the system
performance by employing multiple channel uses to convey a single message
(output plant observation or control input). Common ways of doing so are
through either repeating the message, or by quantizing it to a number of bits
and then transmitting a channel coded version of the bits whose length is
commensurate with the number of channel uses per sampled message. We argue that
such &quot;separated source and channel coding&quot; can be suboptimal and propose to
perform joint source-channel coding. Since the block length is short we obviate
the need to go to the digital domain altogether and instead consider analog
joint source-channel coding. For the case where the communication signaling
rate is twice the sampling rate, we employ the Archimedean bi-spiral-based
Shannon-Kotel'nikov analog maps to show significant improvement in stability
margins and linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) costs over simple schemes that
employ repetition.

 <dc:description>  During the last decade, multi-scale models in mechanics, bio-mechanics and
life sciences have gained increasing attention. Using multi-scale approaches,
effects on different time and length scales, such as, e.g., cellular and organ
scale, can be coupled and their interaction can be studied. Clearly, this
requires the development of new mathematical models and numerical methods for
multi-scale problems, in order to provide reliable and efficient tools for the
investigation of multi-scale effects. Here, we give an overview on existing
numerical approaches for multi-scale simulations in bio-mechanics with
particular emphasis on stochastic effects.

 <dc:description>  Loop-closure detection on 3D data is a challenging task that has been
commonly approached by adapting image-based solutions. Methods based on local
features suffer from ambiguity and from robustness to environment changes while
methods based on global features are viewpoint dependent. We propose SegMatch,
a reliable loop-closure detection algorithm based on the matching of 3D
segments. Segments provide a good compromise between local and global
descriptions, incorporating their strengths while reducing their individual
drawbacks.
  SegMatch does not rely on assumptions of &quot;perfect segmentation&quot;, or on the
existence of &quot;objects&quot; in the environment, which allows for reliable execution
on large scale, unstructured environments. We quantitatively demonstrate that
SegMatch can achieve accurate localization at a frequency of 1Hz on the largest
sequence of the KITTI odometry dataset. We furthermore show how this algorithm
can reliably detect and close loops in real-time, during online operation. In
addition, the source code for the SegMatch algorithm will be made available
after publication.

 <dc:description>  The 'conjunction fallacy' has been extensively debated by scholars in
cognitive science and, in recent times, the discussion has been enriched by the
proposal of modeling the fallacy using the quantum formalism. Two major quantum
approaches have been put forward: the first assumes that respondents use a
two-step sequential reasoning and that the fallacy results from the presence of
'question order effects'; the second assumes that respondents evaluate the
cognitive situation as a whole and that the fallacy results from the 'emergence
of new meanings', as an 'effect of overextension' in the conceptual
conjunction. Thus, the question arises as to determine whether and to what
extent conjunction fallacies would result from 'order effects' or, instead,
from 'emergence effects'. To help clarify this situation, we propose to use the
World Wide Web as an 'information space' that can be interrogated both in a
sequential and non-sequential way, to test these two quantum approaches. We
find that 'emergence effects', and not 'order effects', should be considered
the main cognitive mechanism producing the observed conjunction fallacies.

 <dc:description>  In evolutionary robotics an encoding of the control software, which maps
sensor data (input) to motor control values (output), is shaped by stochastic
optimization methods to complete a predefined task. This approach is assumed to
be beneficial compared to standard methods of controller design in those cases
where no a-priori model is available that could help to optimize performance.
Also for robots that have to operate in unpredictable environments, an
evolutionary robotics approach is favorable. We demonstrate here that such a
model-free approach is not a free lunch, as already simple tasks can represent
unsolvable barriers for fully open-ended uninformed evolutionary computation
techniques. We propose here the 'Wankelmut' task as an objective for an
evolutionary approach that starts from scratch without pre-shaped controller
software or any other informed approach that would force the behavior to be
evolved in a desired way. Our focal claim is that 'Wankelmut' represents the
simplest set of problems that makes plain-vanilla evolutionary computation
fail. We demonstrate this by a series of simple standard evolutionary
approaches using different fitness functions and standard artificial neural
networks as well as continuous-time recurrent neural networks. All our tested
approaches failed. We claim that any other evolutionary approach will also fail
that does per-se not favor or enforce modularity and does not freeze or protect
already evolved functionalities. Thus we propose a hard-to-pass benchmark and
make a strong statement for self-complexifying and generative approaches in
evolutionary computation. We anticipate that defining such a 'simplest task to
fail' is a valuable benchmark for promoting future development in the field of
artificial intelligence, evolutionary robotics and artificial life.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers physical layer security and the design of secure coset
codes for wiretap channels, where information is not to be leaked to an
eavesdropper having a degraded channel. The eavesdropper's bounds for correct
decoding probability and information are first revisited, and a new variant of
the information bound is derived. The new bound is valid for a general channel
with any fading and Gaussian noise. From these bounds, it is explicit that both
the information and probability are upper bounded by the average flatness
factor, i.e., the expected theta function of the faded lattice related to the
eavesdropper. Taking the minimization of the average flatness factor as a
design criterion, simple geometric heuristics to minimize it in the low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime in Gaussian and Rayleigh fast fading
channels are motivated. It is concluded that in the Gaussian channel, the
security boils down to the sphere packing density of the eavesdropper's
lattice, whereas in the Rayleigh fading channel a full-diversity well-rounded
lattice with a dense sphere packing will provide the best secrecy. The proposed
criteria are backed up by extensive numerical experiments.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we examine learning methods combining the Random Neural
Network, a biologically inspired neural network and the Extreme Learning
Machine that achieve state of the art classification performance while
requiring much shorter training time. The Random Neural Network is a integrate
and fire computational model of a neural network whose mathematical structure
permits the efficient analysis of large ensembles of neurons. An activation
function is derived from the RNN and used in an Extreme Learning Machine. We
compare the performance of this combination against the ELM with various
activation functions, we reduce the input dimensionality via PCA and compare
its performance vs. autoencoder based versions of the RNN-ELM.

 <dc:description>  Conventional approaches to image de-fencing use multiple adjacent frames for
segmentation of fences in the reference image and are limited to restoring
images of static scenes only. In this paper, we propose a de-fencing algorithm
for images of dynamic scenes using an occlusion-aware optical flow method. We
divide the problem of image de-fencing into the tasks of automated fence
segmentation from a single image, motion estimation under known occlusions and
fusion of data from multiple frames of a captured video of the scene.
Specifically, we use a pre-trained convolutional neural network to segment
fence pixels from a single image. The knowledge of spatial locations of fences
is used to subsequently estimate optical flow in the occluded frames of the
video for the final data fusion step. We cast the fence removal problem in an
optimization framework by modeling the formation of the degraded observations.
The inverse problem is solved using fast iterative shrinkage thresholding
algorithm (FISTA). Experimental results show the effectiveness of proposed
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Neural machine translation (NMT) heavily relies on word-level modelling to
learn semantic representations of input sentences. However, for languages
without natural word delimiters (e.g., Chinese) where input sentences have to
be tokenized first, conventional NMT is confronted with two issues: 1) it is
difficult to find an optimal tokenization granularity for source sentence
modelling, and 2) errors in 1-best tokenizations may propagate to the encoder
of NMT. To handle these issues, we propose word-lattice based Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) encoders for NMT, which generalize the standard RNN to word
lattice topology. The proposed encoders take as input a word lattice that
compactly encodes multiple tokenizations, and learn to generate new hidden
states from arbitrarily many inputs and hidden states in preceding time steps.
As such, the word-lattice based encoders not only alleviate the negative impact
of tokenization errors but also are more expressive and flexible to embed input
sentences. Experiment results on Chinese-English translation demonstrate the
superiorities of the proposed encoders over the conventional encoder.

 <dc:description>  We apply Stone duality and model theory to study the structure theory of free
pro-aperiodic monoids. Stone duality implies that elements of the free
pro-aperiodic monoid may be viewed as elementary equivalence classes of
pseudofinite words. Model theory provides us with saturated words in each such
class, i.e., words in which all possible factorizations are realized. We give
several applications of this new approach, including a solution to the word
problem for $\omega$-terms that avoids using McCammond's normal forms, as well
as new proofs and extensions of other structural results concerning free
pro-aperiodic monoids.

 <dc:description>  Automatic estimation of skinning transformations is a popular way to deform a
single reference shape into a new pose by providing a small number of control
parameters. We generalize this approach by efficiently enabling the use of
multiple exemplar shapes. Using a small set of representative natural poses, we
propose to express an unseen appearance by a low-dimensional linear subspace,
specified by a redundant dictionary of weighted vertex positions. Minimizing a
nonlinear functional that regulates the example manifold, the suggested
approach supports local-rigid deformations of articulated objects, as well as
nearly isometric embeddings of smooth shapes. A real-time non-rigid deformation
system is demonstrated, and a shape completion and partial registration
framework is introduced. These applications can recover a target pose and
implicit inverse kinematics from a small number of examples and just a few
vertex positions. The result reconstruction is more accurate compared to
state-of-the-art reduced deformable models.

 <dc:description>  Implementing an accurate and fast activation function with low cost is a
crucial aspect to the implementation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on FPGAs.
We propose a high-accuracy approximation approach for the hyperbolic tangent
activation function of artificial neurons in DNNs. It is based on the Discrete
Cosine Transform Interpolation Filter (DCTIF). The proposed architecture
combines simple arithmetic operations on stored samples of the hyperbolic
tangent function and on input data. The proposed DCTIF implementation achieves
two orders of magnitude greater precision than previous work while using the
same or fewer computational resources. Various combinations of DCTIF parameters
can be chosen to tradeoff the accuracy and complexity of the hyperbolic tangent
function. In one case, the proposed architecture approximates the hyperbolic
tangent activation function with 10E-5 maximum error while requiring only 1.52
Kbits memory and 57 LUTs of a Virtex-7 FPGA. We also discuss how the activation
function accuracy affects the performance of DNNs in terms of their training
and testing accuracies. We show that a high accuracy approximation can be
necessary in order to maintain the same DNN training and testing performances
realized by the exact function.

 <dc:description>  We present a factorized compositional distributional semantics model for the
representation of transitive verb constructions. Our model first produces
(subject, verb) and (verb, object) vector representations based on the
similarity of the nouns in the construction to each of the nouns in the
vocabulary and the tendency of these nouns to take the subject and object roles
of the verb. These vectors are then combined into a final (subject,verb,object)
representation through simple vector operations. On two established tasks for
the transitive verb construction our model outperforms recent previous work.

 <dc:description>  Given $n$ intervals on a line $\ell$, we consider the problem of moving these
intervals on $\ell$ such that no two intervals overlap and the maximum moving
distance of the intervals is minimized. The difficulty for solving the problem
lies in determining the order of the intervals in an optimal solution. By
interesting observations, we show that it is sufficient to consider at most $n$
&quot;candidate&quot; lists of ordered intervals. Further, although explicitly
maintaining these lists takes $\Omega(n^2)$ time and space, by more
observations and a pruning technique, we present an algorithm that can compute
an optimal solution in $O(n\log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space. We also prove an
$\Omega(n\log n)$ time lower bound for solving the problem, which implies the
optimality of our algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address a rain removal problem from a single image, even in
the presence of heavy rain and rain streak accumulation. Our core ideas lie in
the new rain image models and a novel deep learning architecture. We first
modify an existing model comprising a rain streak layer and a background layer,
by adding a binary map that locates rain streak regions. Second, we create a
new model consisting of a component representing rain streak accumulation
(where individual streaks cannot be seen, and thus visually similar to mist or
fog), and another component representing various shapes and directions of
overlapping rain streaks, which usually happen in heavy rain. Based on the
first model, we develop a multi-task deep learning architecture that learns the
binary rain streak map, the appearance of rain streaks, and the clean
background, which is our ultimate output. The additional binary map is
critically beneficial, since its loss function can provide additional strong
information to the network. To handle rain streak accumulation (again, a
phenomenon visually similar to mist or fog) and various shapes and directions
of overlapping rain streaks, we propose a recurrent rain detection and removal
network that removes rain streaks and clears up the rain accumulation
iteratively and progressively. In each recurrence of our method, a new
contextualized dilated network is developed to exploit regional contextual

 <dc:description>  The challenge in engaging malware activities involves the correct
identification and classification of different malware variants. Various
malwares incorporate code obfuscation methods that alters their code signatures
effectively countering antimalware detection techniques utilizing static
methods and signature database. In this study, we utilized an approach of
converting a malware binary into an image and use Random Forest to classify
various malware families. The resulting accuracy of 0.9562 exhibits the
effectivess of the method in detecting malware

 <dc:title>Commonsense reasoning, commonsense knowledge, and the SP theory of
  intelligence</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wolff, J Gerard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes how the &quot;SP theory of intelligence&quot;, outlined in an
Appendix, may throw light on aspects of commonsense reasoning (CSR) and
commonsense knowledge (CSK) (together shortened to CSRK), as discussed in
another paper by Ernest Davis and Gary Marcus (DM). The SP system has the
generality needed for CSRK: Turing equivalence; the generality of information
compression as the foundation for the SP system both in the representation of
knowledge and in concepts of prediction and probability; the versatility of the
SP system in the representation of knowledge and in aspects of intelligence
including forms of reasoning; and the potential of the system for the seamless
integration of diverse forms of knowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence.
Several examples discussed by DM, and how they may be processed in the SP
system, are discussed. Also discussed are current successes in CSR (taxonomic
reasoning, temporal reasoning, action and change, and qualitative reasoning),
how the SP system may promote seamless integration across these areas, and how
insights gained from the SP programme of research may yield some potentially
useful new ways of approaching these topics. The paper considers how the SP
system may help overcome several challenges in the automation of CSR described
by DM, and how it meets several of the objectives for research in CSRK that
they have described.

 <dc:description>  Suppose $\mathcal{F}$ is a finite family of graphs. We consider the following
meta-problem, called $\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion: given a graph $G$ and
integer $k$, decide whether the deletion of at most $k$ edges of $G$ can result
in a graph that does not contain any graph from $\mathcal{F}$ as an immersion.
This problem is a close relative of the $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion problem
studied by Fomin et al. [FOCS 2012], where one deletes vertices in order to
remove all minor models of graphs from $\mathcal{F}$.
  We prove that whenever all graphs from $\mathcal{F}$ are connected and at
least one graph of $\mathcal{F}$ is planar and subcubic, then the
$\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion problem admits: a constant-factor
approximation algorithm running in time $O(m^3 \cdot n^3 \cdot \log m)$; a
linear kernel that can be computed in time $O(m^4 \cdot n^3 \cdot \log m)$; and
a $O(2^{O(k)} + m^4 \cdot n^3 \cdot \log m)$-time fixed-parameter algorithm,
where $n,m$ count the vertices and edges of the input graph.
  These results mirror the findings of Fomin et al. [FOCS 2012], who obtained a
similar set of algorithmic results for $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion, under the
assumption that at least one graph from $\mathcal{F}$ is planar. An important
difference is that we are able to obtain a linear kernel for
$\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion, while the exponent of the kernel of Fomin et
al. for $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion depends heavily on the family
$\mathcal{F}$. In fact, this dependence is unavoidable under plausible
complexity assumptions, as proven by Giannopoulou et al. [ICALP 2015]. This
reveals that the kernelization complexity of $\mathcal{F}$-Immersion Deletion
is quite different than that of $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Deletion.

 <dc:title>Unidirectional Quorum-based Cycle Planning for Efficient Resource
  Utilization and Fault-Tolerance</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kleinheksel, Cory J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Somani, Arun K.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a greedy cycle direction heuristic to improve the
generalized $\mathbf{R}$ redundancy quorum cycle technique. When applied using
only single cycles rather than the standard paired cycles, the generalized
$\mathbf{R}$ redundancy technique has been shown to almost halve the necessary
light-trail resources in the network. Our greedy heuristic improves this
cycle-based routing technique's fault-tolerance and dependability.
  For efficiency and distributed control, it is common in distributed systems
and algorithms to group nodes into intersecting sets referred to as quorum
sets. Optimal communication quorum sets forming optical cycles based on
light-trails have been shown to flexibly and efficiently route both
point-to-point and multipoint-to-multipoint traffic requests. Commonly cycle
routing techniques will use pairs of cycles to achieve both routing and
fault-tolerance, which uses substantial resources and creates the potential for
underutilization. Instead, we use a single cycle and intentionally utilize
$\mathbf{R}$ redundancy within the quorum cycles such that every point-to-point
communication pairs occur in at least $\mathbf{R}$ cycles. Without the paired
cycles the direction of the quorum cycles becomes critical to the fault
tolerance performance. For this we developed a greedy cycle direction heuristic
and our single fault network simulations show a reduction of missing pairs by
greater than 30%, which translates to significant improvements in fault
coverage.

 <dc:description>  We present new quantum algorithms for Triangle Finding improving its best
previously known quantum query complexities for both dense and spare
instances.For dense graphs on $n$ vertices, we get a query complexity of
$O(n^{5/4})$ without any of the extra logarithmic factors present in the
previous algorithm of Le Gall [FOCS'14]. For sparse graphs with $m\geq n^{5/4}$
edges, we get a query complexity of $O(n^{11/12}m^{1/6}\sqrt{\log n})$, which
is better than the one obtained by Le Gall and Nakajima [ISAAC'15] when $m \geq
n^{3/2}$. We also obtain an algorithm with query complexity ${O}(n^{5/6}(m\log
n)^{1/6}+d_2\sqrt{n})$ where $d_2$ is the variance of the degree distribution.
Our algorithms are designed and analyzed in a new model of learning graphs that
we call extended learning graphs. In addition, we present a framework in order
to easily combine and analyze them. As a consequence we get much simpler
algorithms and analyses than previous algorithms of Le Gall {\it et al} based
on the MNRS quantum walk framework [SICOMP'11].

 <dc:title>Error Correction Coding Meets Cyber-Physical Systems: Message-Passing
  Analysis of Self-Healing Interdependent Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Behfarnia, Ali</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Coupling cyber and physical systems gives rise to numerous engineering
challenges and opportunities. An important challenge is the contagion of
failure from one system to another, which can lead to large-scale cascading
failures. However, the self-healing ability emerges as a valuable opportunity
where the overlaying cyber network can cure failures in the underlying physical
network. To capture both self-healing and contagion, this paper considers a
graphical model representation of an interdependent cyber-physical system, in
which nodes represent various cyber or physical functionalities, and edges
capture the interactions between the nodes. A message-passing algorithm is
proposed for this representation to study the dynamics of failure propagation
and healing. By conducting a density evolution analysis for this algorithm,
network reaction to initial disruptions is investigated. It is proved that as
the number of message-passing iterations increases, the network reaches a
steady-state condition that would be either a complete healing or a complete
collapse. Then, a sufficient condition is derived to select the network
parameters to guarantee the complete healing of the system. The result of the
density evolution analysis is further employed to jointly optimize the design
of cyber and physical networks for maximum resiliency. This analytical
framework is then extended to the cases where propagation of failures in the
physical network is faster than the healing responses of the cyber network.
Such scenarios are of interest in many real-life applications such as smart
grid. Finally, extensive numerical results are presented to verify the analysis
and investigate the impact of the network parameters on the resiliency of the
network.

 <dc:title>The Exact Rate-Memory Tradeoff for Caching with Uncoded Prefetching</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yu, Qian</dc:creator>

 <dc:creator>Avestimehr, A. Salman</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a basic cache network, in which a single server is connected to
multiple users via a shared bottleneck link. The server has a database of files
(content). Each user has an isolated memory that can be used to cache content
in a prefetching phase. In a following delivery phase, each user requests a
file from the database, and the server needs to deliver users' demands as
efficiently as possible by taking into account their cache contents. We focus
on an important and commonly used class of prefetching schemes, where the
caches are filled with uncoded data. We provide the exact characterization of
the rate-memory tradeoff for this problem, by deriving both the minimum average
rate (for a uniform file popularity) and the minimum peak rate required on the
bottleneck link for a given cache size available at each user. In particular,
we propose a novel caching scheme, which strictly improves the state of the art
by exploiting commonality among user demands. We then demonstrate the exact
optimality of our proposed scheme through a matching converse, by dividing the
set of all demands into types, and showing that the placement phase in the
proposed caching scheme is universally optimal for all types. Using these
techniques, we also fully characterize the rate-memory tradeoff for a
decentralized setting, in which users fill out their cache content without any
coordination.

 <dc:description>  Since the early days of computers and programs, the process and outcomes of
software development has been a minefield plagued with problems and failures,
as much as the complexity and complication of software and its development has
increased by a thousandfold in half a century. Over the years, a number of
theories, laws, best practices, manifestos and methodologies have emerged, with
varied degrees of (un)success. Our experience as software engineers of complex
and large-scale systems shows that those guidelines are bound to previously
defined and often narrow scopes. Enough is enough. Nowadays, nearly every
company is in the software and services business and everything is - or is
managed by - software. It is about time, then, that the laws that govern our
universe ought to be redefined. In this context, we discuss and present a set
of universal laws that leads us to propose the first commandment of software
engineering for all varieties of information systems.

 <dc:title>Optimizations and Heuristics to improve Compression in Columnar Database
  Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jayanth, Jayanth</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In-memory columnar databases have become mainstream over the last decade and
have vastly improved the fast processing of large volumes of data through
multi-core parallelism and in-memory compression thereby eliminating the usual
bottlenecks associated with disk-based databases. For scenarios, where the data
volume grows into terabytes and petabytes, keeping all the data in memory is
exorbitantly expensive. Hence, the data is compressed efficiently using
different algorithms to exploit the multi-core parallelization technologies for
query processing. Several compression methods are studied for compressing the
column array, post Dictionary Encoding. In this paper, we will present two
novel optimizations in compression techniques - Block Size Optimized Cluster
Encoding and Block Size Optimized Indirect Encoding - which perform better than
their predecessors. In the end, we also propose heuristics to choose the best
encoding amongst common compression schemes.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new multi-view RGB-D dataset of nine kitchen scenes,
each containing several objects in realistic cluttered environments including a
subset of objects from the BigBird dataset. The viewpoints of the scenes are
densely sampled and objects in the scenes are annotated with bounding boxes and
in the 3D point cloud. Also, an approach for detection and recognition is
presented, which is comprised of two parts: i) a new multi-view 3D proposal
generation method and ii) the development of several recognition baselines
using AlexNet to score our proposals, which is trained either on crops of the
dataset or on synthetically composited training images. Finally, we compare the
performance of the object proposals and a detection baseline to the Washington
RGB-D Scenes (WRGB-D) dataset and demonstrate that our Kitchen scenes dataset
is more challenging for object detection and recognition. The dataset is

 <dc:description>  Logical Probability (LP) is strictly distinguished from Statistical
Probability (SP). To measure semantic information or confirm hypotheses, we
need to use sampling distribution (conditional SP function) to test or confirm
fuzzy truth function (conditional LP function). The Semantic Information
Measure (SIM) proposed is compatible with Shannon's information theory and
Fisher's likelihood method. It can ensure that the less the LP of a predicate
is and the larger the true value of the proposition is, the more information
there is. So the SIM can be used as Popper's information criterion for
falsification or test. The SIM also allows us to optimize the true-value of
counterexamples or degrees of disbelief in a hypothesis to get the optimized
degree of belief, i. e. Degree of Confirmation (DOC). To explain confirmation,
this paper 1) provides the calculation method of the DOC of universal
hypotheses; 2) discusses how to resolve Raven Paradox with new DOC and its
increment; 3) derives the DOC of rapid HIV tests: DOC of
test-positive=1-(1-specificity)/sensitivity, which is similar to Likelihood
Ratio (=sensitivity/(1-specificity)) but has the upper limit 1; 4) discusses
negative DOC for excessive affirmations, wrong hypotheses, or lies; and 5)
discusses the DOC of general hypotheses with GPS as example.

 <dc:description>  Wireless networks with the consideration of social relationships among
network nodes are highly appealing for lots of important data communication
services. Ensuring the security of such networks is of great importance to
facilitate their applications in supporting future social-based services with
strong security guarantee. This paper explores the physical layer
security-based secure communication in a finite Poisson network with social
friendships among nodes, for which a social friendship-based cooperative
jamming scheme is proposed. The jamming scheme consists of a Local Friendship
Circle (LFC) and a Long-range Friendship Annulus (LFA), where all legitimate
nodes in the LFC serve as jammers, but the legitimate nodes in the LFA are
selected as jammers through three location-based policies. To understand both
the security and reliability performance of the proposed jamming scheme, we
first model the sum interference at any location in the network by deriving its
Laplace transform under two typical path loss scenarios. With the help of the
interference Laplace transform results, we then derive the exact expression for
the transmission outage probability (TOP) and determine both the upper and
lower bounds on the secrecy outage probability (SOP), such that the overall
outage performances of the proposed jamming scheme can be depicted. Finally, we
present extensive numerical results to validate the theoretical analysis of TOP
and SOP and also to illustrate the impacts of the friendship-based cooperative
jamming on the network performances.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider finite flag-transitive affine planes with a
solvable automorphism group. Under a mild number-theoretic condition involving
the order and dimension of the plane, the translation complement must contain a
linear cyclic subgroup that either is transitive or has two equal-sized orbits
on the line at infinity. We develop a new approach to the study of such planes
by associating them with planar functions and permutation polynomials in the
odd order and even order case respectively. In the odd order case, we
characterize the Kantor-Suetake family by using Menichetti's classification of
generalized twisted fields and Blokhuis, Lavrauw and Ball's classifcation of
rank two commutative semifields. In the even order case, we develop a technique
to study permutation polynomials of DO type by quadratic forms and characterize
such planes that have dimensions up to four over their kernels.

 <dc:description>  Micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) are strongly limited in their payload and power
capacity. In order to implement autonomous navigation, algorithms are therefore
desirable that use sensory equipment that is as small, low-weight, and
low-power consuming as possible. In this paper, we propose a method for
autonomous MAV navigation and exploration using a low-cost consumer-grade
quadrocopter equipped with a monocular camera. Our vision-based navigation
system builds on LSD-SLAM which estimates the MAV trajectory and a semi-dense
reconstruction of the environment in real-time. Since LSD-SLAM only determines
depth at high gradient pixels, texture-less areas are not directly observed so
that previous exploration methods that assume dense map information cannot
directly be applied. We propose an obstacle mapping and exploration approach
that takes the properties of our semi-dense monocular SLAM system into account.
In experiments, we demonstrate our vision-based autonomous navigation and
exploration system with a Parrot Bebop MAV.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we analyse the coverage probability and the area spectral
efficiency (ASE) for the uplink (UL) of dense small cell networks (SCNs)
considering a practical path loss model incorporating both line-of-sight (LoS)
and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmissions. Compared with the existing work, we
adopt the following novel approaches in our study: (i) we assume a practical
user association strategy (UAS) based on the smallest path loss, or
equivalently the strongest received signal strength; (ii) we model the
positions of both base stations (BSs) and the user equipments (UEs) as two
independent Homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPPs); and (iii) the
correlation of BSs' and UEs' positions is considered, thus making our
analytical results more accurate. The performance impact of LoS and NLoS
transmissions on the ASE for the UL of dense SCNs is shown to be significant,
both quantitatively and qualitatively, compared with existing work that does
not differentiate LoS and NLoS transmissions. In particular, existing work
predicted that a larger UL power compensation factor would always result in a
better ASE in the practical range of BS density, i.e., 10^1-10^3 BSs/km^2.
However, our results show that a smaller UL power compensation factor can
greatly boost the ASE in the UL of dense SCNs, i.e., 10^2-10^3 BSs/km^2, while
a larger UL power compensation factor is more suitable for sparse SCNs, i.e.,
10^1-10^2 BSs/km^2.

 <dc:description>  Recent neural network sequence models with softmax classifiers have achieved
their best language modeling performance only with very large hidden states and
large vocabularies. Even then they struggle to predict rare or unseen words
even if the context makes the prediction unambiguous. We introduce the pointer
sentinel mixture architecture for neural sequence models which has the ability
to either reproduce a word from the recent context or produce a word from a
standard softmax classifier. Our pointer sentinel-LSTM model achieves state of
the art language modeling performance on the Penn Treebank (70.9 perplexity)
while using far fewer parameters than a standard softmax LSTM. In order to
evaluate how well language models can exploit longer contexts and deal with
more realistic vocabularies and larger corpora we also introduce the freely
available WikiText corpus.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Finding feasible, collision-free paths for multiagent systems can be
challenging, particularly in non-communicating scenarios where each agent's
intent (e.g. goal) is unobservable to the others. In particular, finding time
efficient paths often requires anticipating interaction with neighboring
agents, the process of which can be computationally prohibitive. This work
presents a decentralized multiagent collision avoidance algorithm based on a
novel application of deep reinforcement learning, which effectively offloads
the online computation (for predicting interaction patterns) to an offline
learning procedure. Specifically, the proposed approach develops a value
network that encodes the estimated time to the goal given an agent's joint
configuration (positions and velocities) with its neighbors. Use of the value
network not only admits efficient (i.e., real-time implementable) queries for
finding a collision-free velocity vector, but also considers the uncertainty in
the other agents' motion. Simulation results show more than 26 percent
improvement in paths quality (i.e., time to reach the goal) when compared with
optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA), a state-of-the-art collision
avoidance strategy.

 <dc:description>  While the daily user of digital, Internet-enabled devices has some explicit

offering options, and presenting material are using increasingly sophisticated
real-time algorithms that tune and target content for the particular user. They
redefine the historical relationships between tellers and users, providing a

elements of improvisation and audience interaction. The general accessibility
of algorithmically driven content delivery techniques suggests significant
untapped potential for new approaches to narrative beyond advertising and

 <dc:description>  For intelligent robots to interact in meaningful ways with their environment,
they must understand both the geometric and semantic properties of the scene
surrounding them. The majority of research to date has addressed these mapping
challenges separately, focusing on either geometric or semantic mapping. In
this paper we address the problem of building environmental maps that include
both semantically meaningful, object-level entities and point- or mesh-based
geometrical representations. We simultaneously build geometric point cloud
models of previously unseen instances of known object classes and create a map
that contains these object models as central entities. Our system leverages
sparse, feature-based RGB-D SLAM, image-based deep-learning object detection
and 3D unsupervised segmentation.

images given a fashion item. Defining similarity among arbitrary
fashion-products is still remains a challenging problem, even there is no exact
ground-truth. To resolve this problem, we define more than 90 fashion-related
attributes, and combination of these attributes can represent thousands of
unique fashion-styles. The fashion-attributes are one of the ingredients to
define semantic similarity among fashion-product images. To build our system at
scale, these fashion-attributes are again used to build an inverted indexing
scheme. In addition to these fashion-attributes for semantic similarity, we
extract colour and appearance features in a region-of-interest (ROI) of a
fashion item for visual similarity. By sharing our approach, we expect active
discussion on that how to apply current computer vision research into the
e-commerce industry.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we discuss a stochastic decision problem of optimally
selecting the order in which to try $n$ opportunities that may yield an
uncertain reward in the future. The motivation came out from pure curiosity,
after an informal conversation about what could be the best way to date
friends. The problem structure turned out to be suitable also for other
situations, such as the problem of optimally selecting the order of submission
of a paper to journals. Despite the seemingly combinatorial nature of the
problem, we show that optimal-tradeoff solutions can be found by simply
ordering a sequence of $n$ real numbers.

be a finite non-chain ring, where $u^m=u$ and $p$ is a prime congruent to $1$
modulo $(m-1)$. In this paper we study quadratic residue codes over the ring
$\mathcal{R}$ and their extensions. A gray map from $\mathcal{R}$ to
$\mathbb{F}_{p}^m$ is defined which preserves self duality of linear codes. As
a consequence self dual, formally self dual and self orthogonal codes are
constructed. To illustrate this several examples of self-dual, self orthogonal
and formally self-dual codes are given. Among others a [9,3,6] linear code over
$\mathbb{F}_{7}$ is constructed which is self-orthogonal as well as nearly MDS.
The best known linear code with these parameters (ref. Magma) is not self
orthogonal.

 <dc:description>  The emergence of interference alignment (IA) as a degrees-of-freedom optimal
strategy motivates the need to investigate whether IA can be leveraged to aid
conventional network optimization algorithms that are only capable of finding
locally optimal solutions. To test the usefulness of IA in this context, this
paper proposes a two-stage optimization framework for the downlink of a
$G$-cell multi-antenna network with $K$ users/cell. The first stage of the
proposed framework focuses on nulling interference from a set of dominant
interferers using IA, while the second stage optimizes transmit and receive
beamformers to maximize a network-wide utility using the IA solution as the
initial condition. Further, this paper establishes a set of new feasibility
results for partial IA that can be used to guide the number of dominant
interferers to be nulled in the first stage. Through simulations on specific
topologies of a cluster of base-stations, it is observed that the impact of IA
depends on the choice of the utility function and the presence of
out-of-cluster interference. In the absence of out-of-cluster interference, the
proposed framework outperforms straightforward optimization when maximizing the
minimum rate, while providing marginal gains when maximizing sum-rate. However,
the benefit of IA is greatly diminished in the presence of significant
out-of-cluster interference.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of recognizing video sequences of fingerspelled letters
in American Sign Language (ASL). Fingerspelling comprises a significant but
relatively understudied part of ASL. Recognizing fingerspelling is challenging
for a number of reasons: It involves quick, small motions that are often highly
coarticulated; it exhibits significant variation between signers; and there has
been a dearth of continuous fingerspelling data collected. In this work we
collect and annotate a new data set of continuous fingerspelling videos,
compare several types of recognizers, and explore the problem of signer
variation. Our best-performing models are segmental (semi-Markov) conditional
random fields using deep neural network-based features. In the signer-dependent
setting, our recognizers achieve up to about 92% letter accuracy. The
multi-signer setting is much more challenging, but with neural network
adaptation we achieve up to 83% letter accuracies in this setting.

 <dc:title>Linear Support Tensor Machine: Pedestrian Detection in Thermal Infrared
  Images</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Biswas, Sujoy Kumar</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Pedestrian detection in thermal infrared images poses unique challenges
because of the low resolution and noisy nature of the image. Here we propose a
mid-level attribute in the form of multidimensional template, or tensor, using
Local Steering Kernel (LSK) as low-level descriptors for detecting pedestrians
in far infrared images. LSK is specifically designed to deal with intrinsic
image noise and pixel level uncertainty by capturing local image geometry
succinctly instead of collecting local orientation statistics (e.g., histograms
in HOG). Our second contribution is the introduction of a new image similarity
kernel in the popular maximum margin framework of support vector machines that
results in a relatively short and simple training phase for building a rigid
pedestrian detector. Our third contribution is to replace the sluggish but de
facto sliding window based detection methodology with multichannel discrete
Fourier transform, facilitating very fast and efficient pedestrian
localization. The experimental studies on publicly available thermal infrared
images justify our proposals and model assumptions. In addition, the proposed
work also involves the release of our in-house annotations of pedestrians in
more than 17000 frames of OSU Color Thermal database for the purpose of sharing
with the research community.

 <dc:description>  This paper exhibits a series of semantic characterisations of sublinear
nondeterministic complexity classes. These results fall into the general domain
of logic-based approaches to complexity theory and so-called implicit
computational complexity (ICC), i.e. descriptions of complexity classes without
reference to specific machine models. In particular, it relates strongly to ICC
results based on linear logic since the semantic framework considered stems
from work on the latter. Moreover, the obtained characterisations are of a
geometric nature: each class is characterised by a specific action of a group
by measure-preserving maps.

 <dc:title>Using an innovative assessment approach on a real-world group based

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Currently, there is a lack of practical, real-world projects on Computer
Science (CS) courses at Maynooth University. Generally CS undergraduate modules
are composed of 24 hours of lectures and 24 hours of labs where students learn
theoretical concepts in the lectures and apply their understanding to practical
lab-based exercises. The problem with this approach is that students do not
gain any awareness of, or learn how to solve tasks that they are likely to
encounter in a real-world industrial setting; nor do they gain experience of
working as part of a team even though most software development positions
involve team-based work.
  This paper reports on a web-based development module that incorporated a
real-world group based project was re-designed and delivered. The module went
well; however, assessing the work fairly was found to be difficult, especially
where team members contributed at considerably varying levels was a challenge.
Of particular concern was that some hard-working students were penalised by
other students poor work and lazy students were rewarded because of more
hard-working students work.
  This action research project will attempt to re-address how to assess this
group-based work with a cohort of students. The goal of the research is to
implement an innovative assessment structure, using peer-, self-, and
co-assessment, for a group based real-world project, that is deemed fair and
reasonable and provided a good learning environment.

 <dc:title>On the Solution of Large-Scale Robust Transmission Network Expansion
  Planning under Uncertain Demand and Generation Capacity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Two-stage robust optimization has emerged as a relevant approach to deal with
uncertain demand and generation capacity in the transmission network expansion
planning problem. Unfortunately, available solution methodologies for the
resulting trilevel robust counterpart are unsuitable for large-scale problems.
In order to overcome this shortcoming, this paper presents an alternative
column-and-constraint generation algorithm wherein the max-min problem
associated with the second stage is solved by a novel coordinate descent
method. As a major salient feature, the proposed approach does not rely on the
transformation of the second-stage problem to a single-level equivalent. As a
consequence, bilinear terms involving dual variables or Lagrange multipliers do
not arise, thereby precluding the use of computationally expensive big-M-based
linearization schemes. Thus, not only is the computational effort reduced, but
also the typically overlooked non-trivial tuning of bounding parameters for
dual variables or Lagrange multipliers is avoided. The practical applicability
of the proposed methodology is confirmed by numerical testing on several
benchmarks including a case based on the Polish 2383-bus system, which is well
beyond the capability of the robust methods available in the literature.

 <dc:description>  We compare the performance of short-length linear binary codes on the binary
erasure channel and the binary-input Gaussian channel. We use a universal
decoder that can decode any linear binary block code: Gaussian-elimination
based Maximum-Likelihood decoder on the erasure channel and probabilistic
Ordered Statistics Decoder on the Gaussian channel. As such we compare codes
and not decoders. The word error rate versus the channel parameter is found for
LDPC, Reed-Muller, Polar, and BCH codes at length 256 bits. BCH codes
outperform other codes in absence of cyclic redundancy check. Under joint
decoding, the concatenation of a cyclic redundancy check makes all codes
perform very close to optimal lower bounds.

 <dc:description>  Learning from demonstration for motion planning is an ongoing research topic.
In this paper we present a model that is able to learn the complex mapping from
raw 2D-laser range findings and a target position to the required steering
commands for the robot. To our best knowledge, this work presents the first
approach that learns a target-oriented end-to-end navigation model for a
robotic platform. Furthermore, the supervised model training is based on expert
demonstrations generated in simulation with an existing motion planner. We
demonstrate that the learned navigation model is directly transferable to
previously unseen virtual and, more interestingly, real-world environments. It
can safely navigate the robot through obstacle-cluttered environments to reach
the desired targets. We present an extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluation of the neural network-based motion planner, and compare it to a
grid-based global approach, both in simulation and in real-world experiments.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a theoretical model for the adoption process of
Information System Security innovations in organisations. The model stemmed
from the Diffusion of Innovation theory (DOI), the Technology Acceptance Model
(TAM), the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the
Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) framework. The model portrays
Information System Security adoption process progressing in a sequence of
stages. The study considers the adoption process from the initiation stage
until the acquisition of innovation as an organisational level judgement while
the process of innovation assimilation and integration is assessed in terms of
the user behaviour within the organisation. The model also introduces several
factors that influence the Information System Security innovation adoption. By
merging the organisational adoption and user acceptance of innovation in a
single depiction, this research contributes to IS security literature a more
comprehensive model for IS security adoption in organisation, compare to any of
the past representations.

 <dc:description>  We propose a highly structured neural network architecture for semantic
segmentation with an extremely small model size, suitable for low-power
embedded and mobile platforms. Specifically, our architecture combines i) a
Haar wavelet-based tree-like convolutional neural network (CNN), ii) a random
layer realizing a radial basis function kernel approximation, and iii) a linear
classifier. While stages i) and ii) are completely pre-specified, only the
linear classifier is learned from data. We apply the proposed architecture to
outdoor scene and aerial image semantic segmentation and show that the accuracy
of our architecture is competitive with conventional pixel classification CNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture is data efficient in
the sense of matching the accuracy of pixel classification CNNs when trained on
a much smaller data set.

 <dc:description>  We consider a distributed system of a type which is encountered in the study
of diffusion processes with memory and in viscoelasticity. The key feature of
such system is the persistence in the future of the past actions due the memory
described via a certain relaxation kernel, see below.
  The parameters of the kernel have to be inferred from experimental
measurements. Our main result in this paper is that by using two boundary
measurements the identification of a relaxation kernel which is linear
combination of Abel kernels (as often assumed in applications) can be reduced
to the solution of a (linear) deconvolution problem.

 <dc:title>Function Computation through a Bidirectional Relay</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ravi, Jithin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Dey, Bikash Kumar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a function computation problem in a three node wireless network.
Nodes A and B observe two correlated sources $X$ and $Y$ respectively, and want
to compute a function $f(X,Y)$. To achieve this, nodes A and B send messages to
a relay node C at rates $R_A$ and $R_B$ respectively. The relay C then
broadcasts a message to A and B at rate $R_C$. We allow block coding, and study
the achievable region of rate triples under both zero-error and
$\epsilon$-error. As a preparation, we first consider a broadcast network from
the relay to A and B. A and B have side information $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
The relay node C observes both $X$ and $Y$ and broadcasts an encoded message to
A and B. We want to obtain the optimal broadcast rate such that A and B can
recover the function $f(X,Y)$ from the received message and their individual
side information $X$ and $Y$ respectively. For a special case of $f(X,Y) = X
\oplus Y$, we show equivalence between $\epsilon$-error and zero-error
computations-- this gives a rate characterization for zero-error XOR
computation in the broadcast network. As a corollary, this also gives a rate
characterization for zero-error in the relay network when the support set of
$p_{XY}$ is full. For the relay network, the zero-error rate region for
arbitrary functions is characterized in terms of graph coloring of some
suitably defined probabilistic graphs. We then give a single-letter inner bound
to this rate region. Further, we extend the graph theoretic ideas to address
the $\epsilon$-error problem and obtain a single-letter inner bound.

 <dc:description>  Robots and Humans have to share the same environment more and more often. In
the aim of steering robots in a safe and convenient manner among humans it is
required to understand how humans interact with them. This work focuses on
collision avoidance between a human and a robot during locomotion. Having in
mind previous results on human obstacle avoidance, as well as the description
of the main principles which guide collision avoidance strategies, we observe
how humans adapt a goal-directed locomotion task when they have to interfere
with a mobile robot. Our results show differences in the strategy set by humans
to avoid a robot in comparison with avoiding another human. Humans prefer to
give the way to the robot even when they are likely to pass first at the
beginning of the interaction.

 <dc:description>  We introduce multiplicative LSTM (mLSTM), a recurrent neural network
architecture for sequence modelling that combines the long short-term memory
(LSTM) and multiplicative recurrent neural network architectures. mLSTM is
characterised by its ability to have different recurrent transition functions
for each possible input, which we argue makes it more expressive for
autoregressive density estimation. We demonstrate empirically that mLSTM
outperforms standard LSTM and its deep variants for a range of character level
language modelling tasks. In this version of the paper, we regularise mLSTM to
achieve 1.27 bits/char on text8 and 1.24 bits/char on Hutter Prize. We also
apply a purely byte-level mLSTM on the WikiText-2 dataset to achieve a
character level entropy of 1.26 bits/char, corresponding to a word level
perplexity of 88.8, which is comparable to word level LSTMs regularised in
similar ways on the same task.

 <dc:description>  The k-regret query aims to return a size-k subset of the entire database such
that, for any query user that selects a data object in this size-k subset
rather than in the entire database, her regret ratio is minimized. Here, the
regret ratio is modeled by the level of difference in the optimality between
the optimal object in the size-k subset returned and the optimal object in the
entire database. The optimality of a data object in turn is usually modeled by
a utility function of the query user. Compared with traditional top-k queries,
k-regret queries have the advantage of not requiring users to specify their
utility functions. They can discover a size-k subset that minimizes the regret
ratio for a whole family of utility functions without knowing any particular of
them. Previous studies have answered k-regret queries with additive utility
functions such as the linear summation function. However, no existing result
has been reported to answer k-regret queries with multiplicative utility
functions, which are an important family of utility functions.
  In this study, we break the barrier of multiplicative utility functions. We
present an algorithm that can produce answers with a bounded regret ratio to
k-regret queries with multiplicative utility functions. As a case study we
apply this algorithm to process a special type of multiplicative utility
functions, the Cobb-Douglas function, and a closely related function, the
Constant Elasticity of Substitution function. We perform extensive experiments
on the proposed algorithm. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm can
answer k-regret queries with multiplicative utility functions efficiently with
a constantly small regret ratio.

 <dc:description>  Algebraic characterizations of the computational aspects of functions defined
over the real numbers provide very effective tool to understand what
computability and complexity over the reals, and generally over continuous
spaces, mean. This is relevant for both communities of computer scientists and
mathematical analysts, particularly the latter who do not understand (and/or
like) the language of machines and string encodings. Recursive analysis can be
considered the most standard framework of computation over continuous spaces,
it is however defined in a very machine specific way which does not leave much
to intuitiveness. Recently several characterizations, in the form of function
algebras, of recursively computable functions and some sub-recursive classes
were introduced. These characterizations shed light on the hidden behavior of
recursive analysis as they convert complex computational operations on
sequences of real objects to &quot;simple&quot; intuitive mathematical operations such as
integration or taking limits. The authors previously presented a framework for
obtaining algebraic characterizations at the complexity level over compact
domains. The current paper presents a comprehensive extension to that
framework. Though we focus our attention in this paper on functions defined
over the whole real line, the framework, and accordingly the obtained results,
can be easily extended to functions defined over arbitrary domains.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the joint antenna selection (AS) problem for a classical
two-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network where both the base
station and users are equipped with multiple antennas. Since the
exhaustive-search-based optimal AS scheme is computationally prohibitive when
the number of antennas is large, two computationally efficient joint AS
algorithms, namely max-min-max AS (AIA-AS) and max-max-max AS (A$^3$-AS), are
proposed to maximize the system sum-rate. The asymptotic closed-form
expressions for the average sum-rates for both AIA-AS and A$^3$-AS are derived
in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, respectively. Numerical results
demonstrate that both AIA-AS and A$^3$-AS can yield significant performance
gains over comparable schemes. Furthermore, AIA-AS can provide better user
fairness, while the A$^3$-AS scheme can achieve the near-optimal sum-rate
performance.

 <dc:description>  In this paper the application of uncertainty modeling to convolutional neural
networks is evaluated. A novel method for adjusting the network's predictions
based on uncertainty information is introduced. This allows the network to be
either optimistic or pessimistic in its prediction scores. The proposed method
builds on the idea of applying dropout at test time and sampling a predictive
mean and variance from the network's output. Besides the methodological
aspects, implementation details allowing for a fast evaluation are presented.
Furthermore, a multilabel network architecture is introduced that strongly
benefits from the presented approach. In the evaluation it will be shown that
modeling uncertainty allows for improving the performance of a given model
purely at test time without any further training steps. The evaluation
considers several applications in the field of computer vision, including
object classification and detection as well as scene attribute recognition.

 <dc:description>  Mining of spatial data is an enabling technology for mobile services,
Internet-connected cars, and the Internet of Things. But the very
distinctiveness of spatial data that drives utility, comes at the cost of user
privacy. In this work, we continue the tradition of privacy-preserving spatial
analytics, focusing not on point or path data, but on planar spatial regions.
Such data represents the area of a user's most frequent visitation - such as
&quot;around home and nearby shops&quot;. Specifically we consider the
differentially-private release of data structures that support range queries
for counting users' spatial regions. Counting planar regions leads to unique
challenges not faced in existing work. A user's spatial region that straddles
multiple data structure cells can lead to duplicate counting at query time. We
provably avoid this pitfall by leveraging the Euler characteristic. To address
the increased sensitivity of range queries to spatial region data, we calibrate
privacy-preserving noise using bounded user region size and a constrained
inference that uses robust least absolute deviations. Our novel constrained
inference reduces noise and introduces covertness by (privately) imposing
consistency. We provide a full end-to-end theoretical analysis of both
differential privacy and high-probability utility for our approach using
concentration bounds. A comprehensive experimental study on several real-world
datasets establishes practical validity.

 <dc:description>  A new resolution enhancement method is presented for multispectral and
multi-resolution images, such as these provided by the Sentinel-2 satellites.
Starting from the highest resolution bands, band-dependent information
(reflectance) is separated from information that is common to all bands
(geometry of scene elements). This model is then applied to unmix
low-resolution bands, preserving their reflectance, while propagating
band-independent information to preserve the sub-pixel details. A reference
implementation is provided, with an application example for super-resolving
Sentinel-2 data.

 <dc:description>  Analysis and modeling of networked objects are fundamental pieces of modern
data mining. Most real-world networks, from biological to social ones, are
known to have common structural properties. These properties allow us to model
the growth processes of networks and to develop useful algorithms. One
remarkable example is the fractality of networks, which suggests the
self-similar organization of global network structure. To determine the
fractality of a network, we need to solve the so-called box-covering problem,
where preceding algorithms are not feasible for large-scale networks. The lack
of an efficient algorithm prevents us from investigating the fractal nature of
large-scale networks. To overcome this issue, we propose a new box-covering
algorithm based on recently emerging sketching techniques. We theoretically
show that it works in near-linear time with a guarantee of solution accuracy.
In experiments, we have confirmed that the algorithm enables us to study the
fractality of million-scale networks for the first time. We have observed that
its outputs are sufficiently accurate and that its time and space requirements
are orders of magnitude smaller than those of previous algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We consider a Markovian single server queue in which customers are
preemptively scheduled by exogenously assigned priority levels. The novelty in
our model is that the priority levels are randomly assigned from a continuous
probability measure rather than a discrete one. Because the priority levels are
drawn from a continuum, the queue is modeled by a measure-valued stochastic
process. We analyze the steady state behavior of this process and provide
several results. We derive a measure that describes the average distribution of
customer priority levels in the system; we provide a formula for the expected
sojourn time of a customer as a function of his priority level; and we provide
a formula for the expected waiting time of a customer as a function of his
priority level. We interpret these quantitative results and give a qualitative
understanding of how the priority levels affect individual customers as well as
how they affect the system as a whole. The theoretical analysis is verified by
simulation. We also discuss some directions of future work.

 <dc:description>  Soybean is one of the ten greatest crops in the world, answering for
billion-dollar businesses every year. This crop suffers from insect herbivory
that costs millions from producers. Hence, constant monitoring of the crop
foliar damage is necessary to guide the application of insecticides. However,
current methods to measure foliar damage are expensive and dependent on
laboratory facilities, in some cases, depending on complex devices. To cope
with these shortcomings, we introduce an image processing methodology to
measure the foliar damage in soybean leaves. We developed a non-destructive
imaging method based on two techniques, Otsu segmentation and Bezier curves, to
estimate the foliar loss in leaves with or without border damage. We
instantiate our methodology in a mobile application named BioLeaf, which is
freely distributed for smartphone users. We experimented with real-world leaves
collected from a soybean crop in Brazil. Our results demonstrated that BioLeaf
achieves foliar damage quantification with precision comparable to that of
human specialists. With these results, our proposal might assist soybean
producers, reducing the time to measure foliar damage, reducing analytical
costs, and defining a commodity application that is applicable not only to soy,
but also to different crops such as cotton, bean, potato, coffee, and
vegetables.

 <dc:description>  Artificial object perception usually relies on a priori defined models and
feature extraction algorithms. We study how the concept of object can be
grounded in the sensorimotor experience of a naive agent. Without any knowledge
about itself or the world it is immersed in, the agent explores its
sensorimotor space and identifies objects as consistent networks of
sensorimotor transitions, independent from their context. A fundamental drive
for prediction is assumed to explain the emergence of such networks from a
developmental standpoint. An algorithm is proposed and tested to illustrate the
approach.

 <dc:description>  Dropout, a simple and effective way to train deep neural networks, has led to
a number of impressive empirical successes and spawned many recent theoretical
investigations. However, the gap between dropout's training and inference
phases, introduced due to tractability considerations, has largely remained
under-appreciated. In this work, we first formulate dropout as a tractable
approximation of some latent variable model, leading to a clean view of
parameter sharing and enabling further theoretical analysis. Then, we introduce
(approximate) expectation-linear dropout neural networks, whose inference gap
we are able to formally characterize. Algorithmically, we show that our
proposed measure of the inference gap can be used to regularize the standard
dropout training objective, resulting in an \emph{explicit} control of the gap.
Our method is as simple and efficient as standard dropout. We further prove the
upper bounds on the loss in accuracy due to expectation-linearization, describe
classes of input distributions that expectation-linearize easily. Experiments
on three image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that reducing the
inference gap can indeed improve the performance consistently.

 <dc:description>  Single cell responses are shaped by the geometry of signaling kinetic
trajectories carved in a multidimensional space spanned by signaling protein
abundances. It is however challenging to assay large number (&gt;3) of signaling
species in live-cell imaging which makes it difficult to probe single cell
signaling kinetic trajectories in large dimensions. Flow and mass cytometry
techniques can measure a large number (4 - &gt;40) of signaling species but are
unable to track single cells. Thus cytometry experiments provide detailed time
stamped snapshots of single cell signaling kinetics. Is it possible to use the
time stamped cytometry data to reconstruct single cell signaling trajectories?
Borrowing concepts of conserved and slow variables from non-equilibrium
statistical physics we develop an approach to reconstruct signaling
trajectories using snapshot data by creating new variables that remain
invariant or vary slowly during the signaling kinetics. We apply this approach
to reconstruct trajectories using snapshot data obtained from in silico
simulations and live-cell imaging measurements. The use of invariants and slow
variables to reconstruct trajectories provides a radically different way to
track object using snapshot data. The approach is likely to have implications
for solving matching problems in a wide range of disciplines.

 <dc:description>  A number of important applied problems in engineering, finance and medicine
can be formulated as a problem of anomaly detection. A classical approach to
the problem is to describe a normal state using a one-class support vector
machine. Then to detect anomalies we quantify a distance from a new observation
to the constructed description of the normal class. In this paper we present a
new approach to the one-class classification. We formulate a new problem
statement and a corresponding algorithm that allow taking into account a
privileged information during the training phase. We evaluate performance of
the proposed approach using a synthetic dataset, as well as the publicly
available Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset.

 <dc:description>  The delivery and display of 360-degree videos on Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs)
presents many technical challenges. 360-degree videos are ultra high resolution
spherical videos, which contain an omnidirectional view of the scene. However
only a portion of this scene is displayed on the HMD. Moreover, HMD need to
respond in 10 ms to head movements, which prevents the server to send only the
displayed video part based on client feedback. To reduce the bandwidth waste,
while still providing an immersive experience, a viewport-adaptive 360-degree
video streaming system is proposed. The server prepares multiple video
representations, which differ not only by their bit-rate, but also by the
qualities of different scene regions. The client chooses a representation for
the next segment such that its bit-rate fits the available throughput and a
full quality region matches its viewing. We investigate the impact of various
spherical-to-plane projections and quality arrangements on the video quality
displayed to the user, showing that the cube map layout offers the best quality
for the given bit-rate budget. An evaluation with a dataset of users navigating
360-degree videos demonstrates that segments need to be short enough to enable
frequent view switches.

 <dc:description>  We propose a compressed sampling and dictionary learning framework for
fiber-optic sensing using wavelength-tunable lasers. A redundant dictionary is
generated from a model for the reflected sensor signal. Imperfect prior
knowledge is considered in terms of uncertain local and global parameters. To
estimate a sparse representation and the dictionary parameters, we present an
alternating minimization algorithm that is equipped with a pre-processing
routine to handle dictionary coherence. The support of the obtained sparse
signal indicates the reflection delays, which can be used to measure
impairments along the sensing fiber. The performance is evaluated by
simulations and experimental data for a fiber sensor system with common core
architecture.

 <dc:description>  [Background]: Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has become an important
software engineering research method but costs tremendous efforts. [Aim]: This
paper proposes an approach to leverage on empirically evolved ontology to
support automating key SLR activities. [Method]: First, we propose an ontology,
SLRONT, built on SLR experiences and best practices as a groundwork to capture
common terminologies and their relationships during SLR processes; second, we
present an extended version of SLRONT, the COSONT and instantiate it with the
knowledge and concepts extracted from structured abstracts. Case studies
illustrate the details of applying it for supporting SLR steps. [Results]:
Results show that through using COSONT, we acquire the same conclusion compared
with sheer manual works, but the efforts involved is significantly reduced.
[Conclusions]: The approach of using ontology could effectively and efficiently
support the conducting of systematic literature review.

 <dc:description>  The outcomes of this paper are twofold. Implicit complexity.
  We provide an implicit characterization of polynomial time computation in
terms of ordinary differential equations: we characterize the class PTIME of
languages computable in polynomial time in terms of differential equations with
polynomial right-hand side. This result gives a purely continuous elegant and
simple characterization of PTIME. We believe it is the first time complexity
classes are characterized using only ordinary differential equations. Our
characterization extends to functions computable in polynomial time over the
reals in the sense of computable analysis. Our results may provide a new
perspective on classical complexity, by giving a way to define complexity
classes, like PTIME, in a very simple way, without any reference to a notion of
(discrete) machine. This may also provide ways to state classical questions
about computational complexity via ordinary differential equations.
  Continuous-Time Models of Computation.
  Our results can also be interpreted in terms of analog computers or analog
models of computation: As a side effect, we get that the 1941 General Purpose
Analog Computer (GPAC) of Claude Shannon is provably equivalent to Turing
machines both in terms of computability and complexity, a fact that has never
been established before. This result provides arguments in favour of a
generalised form of the Church-Turing Hypothesis, which states that any
physically realistic (macroscopic) computer is equivalent to Turing machines
both in terms of computability and complexity.

 <dc:description>  Providing flexibility and user-interpretability in nonlinear system
identification can be achieved by means of block-oriented methods. One of such
block-oriented system structures is the parallel Wiener-Hammerstein system,
which is a sum of Wiener-Hammerstein branches, consisting of static
nonlinearities sandwiched between linear dynamical blocks. Parallel
Wiener-Hammerstein models have more descriptive power than their single-branch
counterparts, but their identification is a non-trivial task that requires
tailored system identification methods. In this work, we will tackle the
identification problem by performing a tensor decomposition of the Volterra
kernels obtained from the nonlinear system. We illustrate how the parallel
Wiener-Hammerstein block-structure gives rise to a joint tensor decomposition
of the Volterra kernels with block-circulant structured factors. The
combination of Volterra kernels and tensor methods is a fruitful way to tackle
the parallel Wiener-Hammerstein system identification task. In simulation
experiments, we were able to reconstruct very accurately the underlying blocks
under noisy conditions.

 <dc:description>  Given a finite directed graph with $n$ vertices, we define a metric $d_G$ on
$\mathbb{F}_q^n$, where $\mathbb{F}_q$ is the finite field with $q$ elements.
The weight of a word is defined as the number of vertices that can be reached
by a directed path starting at the support of the vector. Two canonical forms,
which do not affect the metric, are given to each graph. Based on these forms
we characterize each such metric. We further use these forms to prove that two
graphs with different canonical forms yield different metrics. Efficient
algorithms to check if a set of metric weights define a metric based on a graph
are given. We provide tight bounds on the number of metric weights required to
reconstruct the metric. Furthermore, we give a complete description of the
group of linear isometries of the graph metrics and a characterization of the
graphs for which every linear code admits a $G$-canonical decomposition.
Considering those graphs, we are able to derive an expression of the packing
radius of linear codes in such metric spaces. Finally, given a directed graph
which determines a hierarchical poset, we present sufficient and necessary
conditions to ensure the validity of the MacWilliams Identity and the
MacWilliams Extension Property.

 <dc:title>S-MART: Novel Tree-based Structured Learning Algorithms Applied to Tweet

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Non-linear models recently receive a lot of attention as people are starting
to discover the power of statistical and embedding features. However,
tree-based models are seldom studied in the context of structured learning
despite their recent success on various classification and ranking tasks. In
this paper, we propose S-MART, a tree-based structured learning framework based
on multiple additive regression trees. S-MART is especially suitable for
handling tasks with dense features, and can be used to learn many different
structures under various loss functions.
  We apply S-MART to the task of tweet entity linking --- a core component of
tweet information extraction, which aims to identify and link name mentions to
entities in a knowledge base. A novel inference algorithm is proposed to handle
the special structure of the task. The experimental results show that S-MART
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tweet entity linking systems.

 <dc:title>Robust Regression For Image Binarization Under Heavy Noises and
  Nonuniform Background</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a robust regression approach for image binarization under
significant background variations and observation noises. The work is motivated
by the need of identifying foreground regions in noisy microscopic image or
degraded document images, where significant background variation and severe
noise make an image binarization challenging. The proposed method first
estimates the background of an input image, subtracts the estimated background
from the input image, and apply a global thresholding to the subtracted outcome
for achieving a binary image of foregrounds. A robust regression approach was
proposed to estimate the background intensity surface with minimal effects of
foreground intensities and noises, and a global threshold selector was proposed
on the basis of a model selection criterion in a sparse regression. The
proposed approach was validated using 26 test images and the corresponding
ground truths, and the outcomes of the proposed work were compared with those
from nine existing image binarization methods. The approach was also combined
with three state-of-the-art morphological segmentation methods to show how the
proposed approach can improve their image segmentation outcomes.

 <dc:description>  A panoramic image mosaic is an attractive visualization for viewing many
overlapping photos, but its images must be both captured and processed
correctly to produce an acceptable composite. We propose Swipe Mosaics, an
interactive visualization that places the individual video frames on a 2D
planar map that represents the layout of the physical scene. Compared to
traditional panoramic mosaics, our capture is easier because the user can both
translate the camera center and film moving subjects. Processing and display
degrade gracefully if the footage lacks distinct, overlapping, non-repeating
texture. Our proposed visual odometry algorithm produces a distribution over
(x,y) translations for image pairs. Inferring a distribution of possible camera
motions allows us to better cope with parallax, lack of texture, dynamic
scenes, and other phenomena that hurt deterministic reconstruction techniques.
Robustness is obtained by training on synthetic scenes with known camera
motions. We show that Swipe Mosaics are easy to generate, support a wide range
of difficult scenes, and are useful for documenting a scene for closer
inspection.

 <dc:description>  User preference integration is of great importance in multi-objective
optimization, in particular in many objective optimization. Preferences have
long been considered in traditional multicriteria decision making (MCDM) which
is based on mathematical programming. Recently, it is integrated in
multi-objective metaheuristics (MOMH), resulting in focus on preferred parts of
the Pareto front instead of the whole Pareto front. The number of publications
on preference-based multi-objective metaheuristics has increased rapidly over
the past decades. There already exist various preference handling methods and
MOMH methods, which have been combined in diverse ways. This article proposes
to use the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to model and systematize the results
developed in this field. A review of the existing work is provided, based on
which an ontology is built and instantiated with state-of-the-art results. The
OWL ontology is made public and open to future extension. Moreover, the usage
of the ontology is exemplified for different use-cases, including querying for
methods that match an engineering application, bibliometric analysis, checking
existence of combinations of preference models and MOMH techniques, and
discovering opportunities for new research and open research questions.

 <dc:description>  Entity linking is the task of identifying mentions of entities in text, and
linking them to entries in a knowledge base. This task is especially difficult
in microblogs, as there is little additional text to provide disambiguating
context; rather, authors rely on an implicit common ground of shared knowledge
with their readers. In this paper, we attempt to capture some of this implicit
context by exploiting the social network structure in microblogs. We build on
the theory of homophily, which implies that socially linked individuals share
interests, and are therefore likely to mention the same sorts of entities. We
implement this idea by encoding authors, mentions, and entities in a continuous
vector space, which is constructed so that socially-connected authors have
similar vector representations. These vectors are incorporated into a neural
structured prediction model, which captures structural constraints that are
inherent in the entity linking task. Together, these design decisions yield F1
improvements of 1%-5% on benchmark datasets, as compared to the previous
state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  Making cities smarter help improve city services and increase citizens'
quality of life. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are
fundamental for progressing towards smarter city environments. Smart City
software platforms potentially support the development and integration of Smart
City applications. However, the ICT community must overcome current significant
technological and scientific challenges before these platforms can be widely
used. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in software platforms for Smart
Cities. We analyzed 23 projects with respect to the most used enabling
technologies, as well as functional and non-functional requirements,
classifying them into four categories: Cyber-Physical Systems, Internet of
Things, Big Data, and Cloud Computing. Based on these results, we derived a
reference architecture to guide the development of next-generation software
platforms for Smart Cities. Finally, we enumerated the most frequently cited
open research challenges, and discussed future opportunities. This survey gives
important references for helping application developers, city managers, system
operators, end-users, and Smart City researchers to make project, investment,
and research decisions.

 <dc:title>How much does a treedepth modulator help to obtain polynomial kernels

 <dc:description>  In the last years, kernelization with structural parameters has been an
active area of research within the field of parameterized complexity. As a
relevant example, Gajarsk{\`y} et al. [ESA 2013] proved that every graph
problem satisfying a property called finite integer index admits a linear
kernel on graphs of bounded expansion and an almost linear kernel on nowhere
dense graphs, parameterized by the size of a $c$-treedepth modulator, which is
a vertex set whose removal results in a graph of treedepth at most $c$, where
$c \geq 1$ is a fixed integer. The authors left as further research to
investigate this parameter on general graphs, and in particular to find
problems that, while admitting polynomial kernels on sparse graphs, behave
differently on general graphs.
  In this article we answer this question by finding two very natural such
problems: we prove that Vertex Cover admits a polynomial kernel on general
graphs for any integer $c \geq 1$, and that Dominating Set does not for any
integer $c \geq 2$ even on degenerate graphs, unless $\text{NP} \subseteq
\text{coNP}/\text{poly}$. For the positive result, we build on the techniques
of Jansen and Bodlaender [STACS 2011], and for the negative result we use a
polynomial parameter transformation for $c\geq 3$ and an OR-cross-composition
for $c = 2$. As existing results imply that Dominating Set admits a polynomial
kernel on degenerate graphs for $c = 1$, our result provides a dichotomy about
the existence of polynomial kernels for Dominating Set on degenerate graphs
with this parameter.

 <dc:description>  A common model for question answering (QA) is that a good answer is one that
is closely related to the question, where relatedness is often determined using
general-purpose lexical models such as word embeddings. We argue that a better
approach is to look for answers that are related to the question in a relevant
way, according to the information need of the question, which may be determined
through task-specific embeddings. With causality as a use case, we implement
this insight in three steps. First, we generate causal embeddings
cost-effectively by bootstrapping cause-effect pairs extracted from free text
using a small set of seed patterns. Second, we train dedicated embeddings over
this data, by using task-specific contexts, i.e., the context of a cause is its
effect. Finally, we extend a state-of-the-art reranking approach for QA to
incorporate these causal embeddings. We evaluate the causal embedding models
both directly with a casual implication task, and indirectly, in a downstream
causal QA task using data from Yahoo! Answers. We show that explicitly modeling
causality improves performance in both tasks. In the QA task our best model
achieves 37.3% P@1, significantly outperforming a strong baseline by 7.7%
(relative).

 <dc:title>Solving Batched Linear Programs on GPU and Multicore CPU</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Linear Programs (LPs) appear in a large number of applications and offloading
them to the GPU is viable to gain performance. Existing work on offloading and
solving an LP on GPU suggests that performance is gained from large sized LPs
(typically 500 constraints, 500 variables and above). In order to gain
performance from GPU for applications involving small to medium sized LPs, we
propose batched solving of a large number of LPs in parallel. In this paper, we
present the design and CUDA implementation of our batched LP solver library,
keeping memory coalescent access, reduced CPU-GPU memory transfer latency and
load balancing as the goals. The performance of the batched LP solver is
compared against sequential solving in the CPU using an open source solver GLPK
(GNU Linear Programming Kit). The performance is evaluated for three types of
LPs. The first type is the initial basic solution as feasible, the second type
is the initial basic solution as infeasible and the third type is the feasible
region as a Hyperbox. For the first type, we show a maximum speedup of
$18.3\times$ when running a batch of $50k$ LPs of size $100$ ($100$ variables,
$100$ constraints). For the second type, a maximum speedup of $12\times$ is
obtained with a batch of $10k$ LPs of size $200$. For the third type, we show a
significant speedup of $63\times$ in solving a batch of nearly $4$ million LPs
of size 5 and $34\times$ in solving 6 million LPs of size $28$. In addition, we
show that the open source library for solving linear programs-GLPK, can be
easily extended to solve many LPs in parallel with multi-threading. The thread
parallel GLPK implementation runs $9.6\times$ faster in solving a batch of
$1e5$ LPs of size $100$, on a $12$-core Intel Xeon processor. We demonstrate
the application of our batched LP solver in the domain of state-space
exploration of mathematical models of control systems design.

 <dc:title>Predictive Positioning and Quality Of Service Ridesharing for Campus
  Mobility On Demand Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Autonomous Mobility On Demand (MOD) systems can utilize fleet management
strategies in order to provide a high customer quality of service (QoS).
Previous works on autonomous MOD systems have developed methods for rebalancing
single capacity vehicles, where QoS is maintained through large fleet sizing.
This work focuses on MOD systems utilizing a small number of vehicles, such as
those found on a campus, where additional vehicles cannot be introduced as
demand for rides increases. A predictive positioning method is presented for
improving customer QoS by identifying key locations to position the fleet in
order to minimize expected customer wait time. Ridesharing is introduced as a
means for improving customer QoS as arrival rates increase. However, with
ridesharing perceived QoS is dependent on an often unknown customer preference.
To address this challenge, a customer ratings model, which learns customer
preference from a 5-star rating, is developed and incorporated directly into a
ridesharing algorithm. The predictive positioning and ridesharing methods are
applied to simulation of a real-world campus MOD system.A combined predictive
positioning and ridesharing approach is shown to reduce customer service times
by up to 29% and the customer ratings model is shown to provide the best
overall MOD fleet management performance over a range of customer preferences.

 <dc:description>  We study a communication framework for nonlinear multibus DC MicroGrids based
on a deliberate modification of the parameters of the primary control and
termed power talk. We assess the case in which the information is modulated in
the deviations of reference voltages of the primary control loops and show that
the outputs of the power talk communication channels can be approximated
through linear combinations of the respective inputs. We show that the
coefficients of the linear combinations, representing equivalent channel gains,
depend on the virtual resistances of the primary control loops, implying that
they can be modified such that effective received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
is increased. On the other hand, we investigate the constraints that power talk
incurs on the supplied power deviations. We show that these constraints
translate into constraints on the reference voltages and virtual resistances
that are imposed on all units in the system. In this regard, we develop an
optimization approach to find the set of controllable virtual resistances that
maximize SNR under the constraints on the supplied power deviations.

 <dc:description>  Learning a joint language-visual embedding has a number of very appealing
properties and can result in variety of practical application, including
natural language image/video annotation and search. In this work, we study
three different joint language-visual neural network model architectures. We
evaluate our models on large scale LSMDC16 movie dataset for two tasks: 1)
Standard Ranking for video annotation and retrieval 2) Our proposed movie
multiple-choice test. This test facilitate automatic evaluation of
visual-language models for natural language video annotation based on human
activities. In addition to original Audio Description (AD) captions, provided
as part of LSMDC16, we collected and will make available a) manually generated
re-phrasings of those captions obtained using Amazon MTurk b) automatically
generated human activity elements in &quot;Predicate + Object&quot; (PO) phrases based on
&quot;Knowlywood&quot;, an activity knowledge mining model. Our best model archives
Recall@10 of 19.2% on annotation and 18.9% on video retrieval tasks for subset
of 1000 samples. For multiple-choice test, our best model achieve accuracy
58.11% over whole LSMDC16 public test-set.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers 1-string representations of planar graphs that are
order-preserving in the sense that the order of crossings along the curve
representing vertex $v$ is the same as the order of edges in the clockwise
order around $v$ in the planar embedding. We show that this does not exist for
all planar graphs (not even for all planar 3-trees), but show existence for
some subclasses of planar partial 3-trees. In particular, for outer-planar
graphs it can be order-preserving and outer-string in the sense that all ends
of strings are on the outside of the representation.

 <dc:description>  We characterize the statistics of nearest-neighbor and contact distance
distributions for Thomas cluster process (TCP), which is a special case of
Poisson cluster process. In particular, we derive the cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of the distance to the nearest point of TCP from a reference
point for three different cases: (i) reference point is not a part of the point
process, (ii) it is chosen uniformly at random from the TCP, and (iii) it is a
randomly chosen point from a cluster chosen uniformly at random from the TCP.
While the first corresponds to the contact distance distribution, the other two
provide two different viewpoints for the nearest-neighbor distance
distribution.

 <dc:title>The Capacity of Private Information Retrieval from Coded Databases</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of private information retrieval (PIR) over a
distributed storage system. The storage system consists of $N$ non-colluding
databases, each storing a coded version of $M$ messages. In the PIR problem,
the user wishes to retrieve one of the available messages without revealing the
message identity to any individual database. We derive the
information-theoretic capacity of this problem, which is defined as the maximum
number of bits of the desired message that can be privately retrieved per one
bit of downloaded information. We show that the PIR capacity in this case is
$C=\left(1+\frac{K}{N}+\frac{K^2}{N^2}+\cdots+\frac{K^{M-1}}{N^{M-1}}\right)^{-1}=(1+R_c+R_c^2+\cdots+R_c^{M-1})^{-1}=\frac{1-R_c}{1-R_c^M}$,
where $R_c$ is the rate of the $(N,K)$ code used. The capacity is a function of
the code rate and the number of messages only regardless of the explicit
structure of the storage code. The result implies a fundamental tradeoff
between the optimal retrieval cost and the storage cost. The result generalizes
the achievability and converse results for the classical PIR with replicating
databases to the case of coded databases.

 <dc:description>  For many low-resource languages, spoken language resources are more likely to
be annotated with translations than with transcriptions. Translated speech data
is potentially valuable for documenting endangered languages or for training
speech translation systems. A first step towards making use of such data would
be to automatically align spoken words with their translations. We present a
model that combines Dyer et al.'s reparameterization of IBM Model 2
(fast-align) and k-means clustering using Dynamic Time Warping as a distance
metric. The two components are trained jointly using expectation-maximization.
In an extremely low-resource scenario, our model performs significantly better
than both a neural model and a strong baseline.

 <dc:title>On-Demand Routing Algorithm with Mobility Prediction in the Mobile

 <dc:creator>Vu, Trung Kien</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kwon, Sungoh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing
algorithm for mobile ad-hoc networks taking into account node mobility.
Changeable topology of such mobile ad-hoc networks provokes overhead messages
in order to search available routes and maintain found routes. The overhead
messages impede data delivery from sources to destination and deteriorate
network performance. To overcome such a challenge, our proposed algorithm
estimates link duration based neighboring node mobility and chooses the most
reliable route. The proposed algorithm also applies the estimate for route
maintenance to lessen the number of overhead messages. Via simulations, the
proposed algorithm is verified in various mobile environments. In the low
mobility environment, by reducing route maintenance messages, the proposed
algorithm significantly improves network performance such as packet data rate
and end-to-end delay. In the high mobility environment, the reduction of route
discovery message enhances network performance since the proposed algorithm
provides more reliable routes.

 <dc:description>  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for
automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of
conventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are
known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation
inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues
have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both
accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's
Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these
issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder
layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and
therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom
layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final
translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference
computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited
set of common sub-word units (&quot;wordpieces&quot;) for both input and output. This
method provides a good balance between the flexibility of &quot;character&quot;-delimited
models and the efficiency of &quot;word&quot;-delimited models, naturally handles
translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the
system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and
uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that
is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14
English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive
results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of
isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60%
compared to Google's phrase-based production system.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes new nonnegative (shallow and multi-layer) autoencoders by
combining the spiking Random Neural Network (RNN) model, the network
architecture typical used in deep-learning area and the training technique
inspired from nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The shallow autoencoder
is a simplified RNN model, which is then stacked into a multi-layer
architecture. The learning algorithm is based on the weight update rules in
NMF, subject to the nonnegative probability constraints of the RNN. The
autoencoders equipped with this learning algorithm are tested on typical image
datasets including the MNIST, Yale face and CIFAR-10 datasets, and also using
16 real-world datasets from different areas. The results obtained through these
tests yield the desired high learning and recognition accuracy. Also, numerical
simulations of the stochastic spiking behavior of this RNN auto encoder, show
that it can be implemented in a highly-distributed manner.

 <dc:description>  In this work, the dynamics of dephasing (without relaxation) in the presence
of a chaotic oscillator is theoretically investigated. The time-dependent
density functional theory (TDDFT) framework was employed in tandem with the
Lindblad master equation approach for modeling the dissipation dynamics. By
employing the Kohn-Sham (K-S) scheme under certain approximations, the exact
model system for the potentials was acquired. In addition, a space-fractional
K-S scheme is developed (using the modified Riemann-Liouville operator) for
modeling the dephasing phenomenon. Extensive analyses and comparative studies
were then done on the results obtained using the space-fractional K-S system
and the conventional K-S system.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  New challenges have emerged from the integration of renewable energy sources
within the conventional electrical grid which powers base stations (BS).
Energy-aware traffic offloading brings a promising solution to maintain the
user performance while reducing the carbon footprint. Focusing on downlink
cellular networks consisting of on-grid, off-grid and hybrid BSs, we propose a
novel power-aware biased cell association where each user independently
partitions BSs into two sets and applies different association biases for each,
depending on the type of power, renewable or not, that can be requested for
service. The gain provided by such strategy regarding the probability of power
outage and the average grid power consumption is investigated. To capture their
dual nature, the bias applied for association with a hybrid BS is not constant
among users nor over time, and is dynamically tailored to the fluctuations of
the BS battery level, the user power requirement and the estimated power
consumed to serve other users potentially associated with the same BS. Such
approach allows to efficiently share the available energy among BSs and turns
high heterogeneity in the BS powering into advantage.

 <dc:description>  Previous attacks that link the sender and receiver of traffic in the Tor
network (&quot;correlation attacks&quot;) have generally relied on analyzing traffic from
TCP connections. The TCP connections of a typical client application, however,
are often accompanied by DNS requests and responses. This additional traffic
presents more opportunities for correlation attacks. This paper quantifies how
DNS traffic can make Tor users more vulnerable to correlation attacks. We
investigate how incorporating DNS traffic can make existing correlation attacks
more powerful and how DNS lookups can leak information to third parties about
anonymous communication. We (i) develop a method to identify the DNS resolvers
of Tor exit relays; (ii) develop a new set of correlation attacks (DefecTor
attacks) that incorporate DNS traffic to improve precision; (iii) analyze the
Internet-scale effects of these new attacks on Tor users; and (iv) develop
improved methods to evaluate correlation attacks. First, we find that there
exist adversaries who can mount DefecTor attacks: for example, Google's DNS
resolver observes almost 40% of all DNS requests exiting the Tor network. We
also find that DNS requests often traverse ASes that the corresponding TCP
connections do not transit, enabling additional ASes to gain information about
Tor users' traffic. We then show that an adversary who can mount a DefecTor
attack can often determine the website that a Tor user is visiting with perfect
precision, particularly for less popular websites where the set of DNS names
associated with that website may be unique to the site. We also use the Tor
Path Simulator (TorPS) in combination with traceroute data from vantage points
co-located with Tor exit relays to estimate the power of AS-level adversaries
who might mount DefecTor attacks in practice.

 <dc:description>  In next generation wireless communication system, wireless transceivers
should be able to handle wideband input signals compromising of multiple
communication standards.Such multi-standard wireless communication receivers
(MWCRs) need filter bank to extract the desired signal of interest from
wideband input spectrum and bring it to the baseband for further signal
processing tasks such as spectrum sensing, modulation
classification,demodulation etc.In MWCRs,rather any wireless receivers,
modulated filter banks, such as Discrete Fourier Transform Filter Banks
(DFTFB), are preferred due to their advantages such as lower area, delay and
power requirements. To support multi-standard operation, reconfigurable DFTFB
(RDFTFB) was proposed by integrating DFTFB with the coefficient decimation
method. In this paper, an efficient high speed implementation of RDFTFB on
Virtex-7 field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) has been proposed.The proposed
approach minimizes the critical path delay between clocked registers thereby
leading to significant improvement in the maximum operating frequency of the
RDFTFB. Numerically, the proposed implementation leads to 89.7% improvement in
the maximum frequency at which RDFTFB can be clocked.Furthermore,proposed
implementation leads to 18.5% reduction in the dynamic power consumption.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an online neural sequence to sequence model that learns to
alternate between encoding and decoding segments of the input as it is read. By
independently tracking the encoding and decoding representations our algorithm
permits exact polynomial marginalization of the latent segmentation during
training, and during decoding beam search is employed to find the best
alignment path together with the predicted output sequence. Our model tackles
the bottleneck of vanilla encoder-decoders that have to read and memorize the
entire input sequence in their fixed-length hidden states before producing any
output. It is different from previous attentive models in that, instead of
treating the attention weights as output of a deterministic function, our model
assigns attention weights to a sequential latent variable which can be
marginalized out and permits online generation. Experiments on abstractive
sentence summarization and morphological inflection show significant
performance gains over the baseline encoder-decoders.

 <dc:title>Generalized Line Spectral Estimation via Convex Optimization</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Line spectral estimation is the problem of recovering the frequencies and
amplitudes of a mixture of a few sinusoids from equispaced samples. However, in
a variety of signal processing problems arising in imaging, radar, and
localization we do not have access directly to such equispaced samples. Rather
we only observe a severely undersampled version of these observations through
linear measurements. This paper is about such generalized line spectral
estimation problems. We reformulate these problems as sparse signal recovery
problems over a continuously indexed dictionary which can be solved via a
convex program. We prove that the frequencies and amplitudes of the components
of the mixture can be recovered perfectly from a near-minimal number of
observations via this convex program. This result holds provided the
frequencies are sufficiently separated, and the linear measurements obey
natural conditions that are satisfied in a variety of applications.

 <dc:title>Robust Time-Series Retrieval Using Probabilistic Adaptive Segmental

 <dc:description>  Traditional pairwise sequence alignment is based on matching individual
samples from two sequences, under time monotonicity constraints. However, in
many application settings matching subsequences (segments) instead of
individual samples may bring in additional robustness to noise or local
non-causal perturbations. This paper presents an approach to segmental sequence
alignment that jointly segments and aligns two sequences, generalizing the
traditional per-sample alignment. To accomplish this task, we introduce a
distance metric between segments based on average pairwise distances and then
present a modified pair-HMM (PHMM) that incorporates the proposed distance
metric to solve the joint segmentation and alignment task. We also propose a
relaxation to our model that improves the computational efficiency of the
generic segmental PHMM. Our results demonstrate that this new measure of
sequence similarity can lead to improved classification performance, while
being resilient to noise, on a variety of sequence retrieval problems, from EEG
to motion sequence classification.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are extensively used for time-series
modeling and prediction. We propose an approach for automatic construction of a
binary classifier based on Long Short-Term Memory RNNs (LSTM-RNNs) for
detection of a vehicle passage through a checkpoint. As an input to the
classifier we use multidimensional signals of various sensors that are
installed on the checkpoint. Obtained results demonstrate that the previous
approach to handcrafting a classifier, consisting of a set of deterministic
rules, can be successfully replaced by an automatic RNN training on an
appropriately labelled data.

 <dc:description>  In multilingual question answering, either the question needs to be
translated into the document language, or vice versa. In addition to direction,
there are multiple methods to perform the translation, four of which we explore
in this paper: word-based, 10-best, context-based, and grammar-based. We build
a feature for each combination of translation direction and method, and train a
model that learns optimal feature weights. On a large forum dataset consisting
of posts in English, Arabic, and Chinese, our novel learn-to-translate approach
was more effective than a strong baseline (p&lt;0.05): translating all text into
English, then training a classifier based only on English (original or
translated) text.

 <dc:description>  Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) is a structured learning model where a team
leader is appointed to facilitate collaborative problem solving among students
for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) courses. This paper
presents an informed HMM-based speaker diarization system. The minimum duration
of short conversationalturns and number of participating students were fed as
side information to the HMM system. A modified form of Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) was used for iterative merging and re-segmentation. Finally, we
used the diarization output to compute a novel dominance score based on
unsupervised acoustic analysis.

 <dc:description>  We propose an algorithm to uncover the intrinsic low-rank component of a
high-dimensional, graph-smooth and grossly-corrupted dataset, under the
situations that the underlying graph is unknown. Based on a model with a
low-rank component plus a sparse perturbation, and an initial graph estimation,
our proposed algorithm simultaneously learns the low-rank component and refines
the graph. Our evaluations using synthetic and real brain imaging data in
unsupervised and supervised classification tasks demonstrate encouraging
performance.

 <dc:description>  Reduction of end-to-end network delays is an optimization task with
applications in multiple domains. Low delays enable improved information flow
in social networks, quick spread of ideas in collaboration networks, low travel
times for vehicles on road networks and increased rate of packets in the case
of communication networks. Delay reduction can be achieved by both improving
the propagation capabilities of individual nodes and adding additional edges in
the network. One of the main challenges in such design problems is that the
effects of local changes are not independent, and as a consequence, there is a
combinatorial search-space of possible improvements. Thus, minimizing the
cumulative propagation delay requires novel scalable and data-driven
approaches.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of network delay minimization via node
upgrades. Although the problem is NP-hard, we show that probabilistic
approximation for a restricted version can be obtained. We design scalable and
high-quality techniques for the general setting based on sampling and targeted
to different models of delay distribution. Our methods scale almost linearly
with the graph size and consistently outperform competitors in quality.

 <dc:description>  Aligning coordinated text streams from multiple sources and multiple
languages has opened many new research venues on cross-lingual knowledge
discovery. In this paper we aim to advance state-of-the-art by: (1). extending
coarse-grained topic-level knowledge mining to fine-grained information units
such as entities and events; (2). following a novel
Data-to-Network-to-Knowledge (D2N2K) paradigm to construct and utilize network
structures to capture and propagate reliable evidence. We introduce a novel
Burst Information Network (BINet) representation that can display the most
important information and illustrate the connections among bursty entities,
events and keywords in the corpus. We propose an effective approach to
construct and decipher BINets, incorporating novel criteria based on
multi-dimensional clues from pronunciation, translation, burst, neighbor and
graph topological structure. The experimental results on Chinese and English
coordinated text streams show that our approach can accurately decipher the
nodes with high confidence in the BINets and that the algorithm can be
efficiently run in parallel, which makes it possible to apply it to huge
amounts of streaming data for never-ending language and information
decipherment.

phenomenon by focusing on #YaMeCanse, the most active protest hashtag in the
history of Twitter in Mexico. Accounts using the hashtag are classified using
the BotOrNot bot detection tool. Our preliminary analysis suggests that bots
played a critical role in disrupting online communication about the protest
movement.

 <dc:description>  We present a new algorithm for spectral clustering based on a column-pivoted
QR factorization that may be directly used for cluster assignment or to provide
an initial guess for k-means. Our algorithm is simple to implement, direct, and
requires no initial guess. Furthermore, it scales linearly in the number of
nodes of the graph and a randomized variant provides significant computational
gains. Provided the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors used for clustering
contains a basis that resembles the set of indicator vectors on the clusters,
we prove that both our deterministic and randomized algorithms recover a basis
close to the indicators in Frobenius norm. We also experimentally demonstrate
that the performance of our algorithm tracks recent information theoretic
bounds for exact recovery in the stochastic block model. Finally, we explore
the performance of our algorithm when applied to a real world graph.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we prove results on the relationship between the complexity of
the group and color isomorphism problems. The difficulty of color isomorphism
problems is known to be closely linked to the the composition factors of the
permutation group involved. Previous works are primarily concerned with
applying color isomorphism to bou nded degree graph isomorphism, and have
therefore focused on the alternating composit ion factors, since those are the
bottleneck in the case of graph isomorphism.
  We consider the color isomorphism problem with composition factors restricted
to those other than the alternating group, show that group isomorphism reduces
in n^(O(log log n)) time to this problem, and, conversely, that a special case
of this color isomorphism problem reduces to a slight generalization of group
isomorphism. We then sharpen our results by identifying the projective special
linear group as the main obstacle to faster algorithms for group isomorphism
and prove that the aforementioned reduc tion from group isomorphism to color
isomorphism in fact produces only cyclic and projective special linear factors.
Our results demonstrate that, just as the alternatin g group was a barrier to
faster algorithms for graph isomorphism for three decades, the projective
special linear group is an obstacle to faster algorithms for group isomorphism.

 <dc:description>  We present an improved orderly algorithm for constructing all unlabelled
lattices up to a given size, that is, an algorithm that constructs the minimal
element of each isomorphism class relative to some total order.
  Our algorithm employs a stabiliser chain approach for cutting branches of the
search space that cannot contain a minimal lattice; to make this work, we grow
lattices by adding a new layer at a time, as opposed to adding one new element
at a time, and we use a total order that is compatible with this modified
strategy.
  The gain in speed is about two orders of magnitude. As an application, we
compute the number of unlabelled lattices on 20 elements.

 <dc:description>  Recommender systems play an increasingly important role in online
applications to help users find what they need or prefer. Collaborative
filtering algorithms that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item
rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. To alleviate this
problem, this paper proposes a simple recommendation algorithm that fully
exploits the similarity information among users and items and intrinsic
structural information of the user-item matrix. The proposed method constructs
a new representation which preserves affinity and structure information in the
user-item rating matrix and then performs recommendation task. To capture
proximity information about users and items, two graphs are constructed.
Manifold learning idea is used to constrain the new representation to be smooth
on these graphs, so as to enforce users and item proximities. Our model is
formulated as a convex optimization problem, for which we need to solve the
well-known Sylvester equation only. We carry out extensive empirical
evaluations on six benchmark datasets to show the effectiveness of this
approach.

 <dc:description>  We consider linear codes associated to Schubert varieties in Grassmannians. A
formula for the minimum distance of these codes was conjectured in 2000 and
after having been established in various special cases, it was proved in 2008
by Xiang. We give an alternative proof of this formula. Further, we propose a
characterization of the minimum weight codewords of Schubert codes by
introducing the notion of Schubert decomposable elements of certain exterior
powers. It is shown that codewords corresponding to Schubert decomposable
elements are of minimum weight and also that the converse is true in many
cases. A lower bound, and in some cases, an exact formula, for the number of
minimum weight codewords of Schubert codes is also given. From a geometric
point of view, these results correspond to determining the maximum number of
$\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points that can lie on a hyperplane section of a
Schubert variety in a Grassmannian with its nondegenerate embedding in a
projective subspace of the Pl\&quot;ucker projective space, and also the number of
hyperplanes for which the maximum is attained.

 <dc:description>  Recently, graphs have been widely used to represent many different kinds of
real world data or observations such as social networks, protein-protein
networks, road networks, and so on. In many cases, each node in a graph is
associated with a set of its attributes and it is critical to not only consider
the link structure of a graph but also use the attribute information to achieve
more meaningful results in various graph mining tasks. Most previous works with
attributed graphs take into ac- count attribute relationships only between
individually connected nodes. However, it should be greatly valuable to find
out which sets of attributes are associated with each other and whether they
are statistically significant or not. Mining such significant associations, we
can uncover novel relationships among the sets of attributes in the graph. We
propose an algorithm that can find those attribute associations efficiently and
effectively, and show experimental results that confirm the high applicability
of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Creating 3D maps on robots and other mobile devices has become a reality in
recent years. Online 3D reconstruction enables many exciting applications in
robotics and AR/VR gaming. However, the reconstructions are noisy and generally
incomplete. Moreover, during onine reconstruction, the surface changes with
every newly integrated depth image which poses a significant challenge for
physics engines and path planning algorithms. This paper presents a novel, fast
and robust method for obtaining and using information about planar surfaces,
such as walls, floors, and ceilings as a stage in 3D reconstruction based on
Signed Distance Fields. Our algorithm recovers clean and accurate surfaces,
reduces the movement of individual mesh vertices caused by noise during online
reconstruction and fills in the occluded and unobserved regions. We implemented
and evaluated two different strategies to generate plane candidates and two
strategies for merging them. Our implementation is optimized to run in
real-time on mobile devices such as the Tango tablet. In an extensive set of
experiments, we validated that our approach works well in a large number of
natural environments despite the presence of significant amount of occlusion,
clutter and noise, which occur frequently. We further show that plane fitting
enables in many cases a meaningful semantic segmentation of real-world scenes.

 <dc:description>  The optimum off-line energy management scheme for multi-user multi-relay
networks employing energy harvesting and wireless energy transfer is studied.
Specifically, the users are capable of harvesting and transferring energy to
each other over consecutive transmissions, though they have no fixed energy
supplies. Meanwhile, network coding for the users' messages is conducted at the
relays to enable cooperative transmission with source nodes in independent but
not necessarily identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) Nakagami-$m$ fading
channels. Therefore, a simultaneous two level cooperation, i.e.,
information-level and energy-level cooperation is conducted. The problem of
energy efficiency (EE) maximization under constraints of the energy causality
and a predefined outage probability threshold is formulated and shown to be
non-convex. By exploiting fractional and geometric programming, a convex
form-based iterative algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently.
Close-to-optimal power allocation and energy cooperation policies across
consecutive transmissions are found. Moreover, the effects of relay locations
and wireless energy transmission efficiency are investigated and the
performance comparison with the current state of solutions demonstrates that
the proposed policies can manage the harvested energy more efficiently.

 <dc:title>An Efficient Method for Robust Projection Matrix Design</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hong, Tao</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhu, Zhihui</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Our objective is to efficiently design a robust projection matrix $\Phi$ for
the Compressive Sensing (CS) systems when applied to the signals that are not
exactly sparse. The optimal projection matrix is obtained by mainly minimizing
the average coherence of the equivalent dictionary. In order to drop the
requirement of the sparse representation error (SRE) for a set of training data
as in [15] [16], we introduce a novel penalty function independent of a
particular SRE matrix. Without requiring of training data, we can efficiently
design the robust projection matrix and apply it for most of CS systems, like a
CS system for image processing with a conventional wavelet dictionary in which
the SRE matrix is generally not available. Simulation results demonstrate the
efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the
state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate with
natural images that under similar compression rate, a CS system with a learned
dictionary in high dimensions outperforms the one in low dimensions in terms of
reconstruction accuracy. This together with the fact that our proposed method
can efficiently work in high dimension suggests that a CS system can be
potentially implemented beyond the small patches in sparsity-based image
processing.

 <dc:description>  Numerous studies have attempted to model the effect of mass media on the
transmission of diseases such as influenza, however quantitative data on media
engagement has until recently been difficult to obtain. With the recent
explosion of &quot;big data&quot; coming from online social media and the like, large
volumes of data on a population's engagement with mass media during an epidemic
are becoming available to researchers. In this study we combine an online data
set comprising millions of shared messages relating to influenza with
traditional surveillance data on flu activity to suggest a functional form for
the relationship between the two. Using this data we present a simple
deterministic model for influenza dynamics incorporating media effects, and
show that such a model helps explain the dynamics of historical influenza
outbreaks. Furthermore, through model selection we show that the proposed media
function fits historical data better than other media functions proposed in
earlier studies.

 <dc:description>  In the era of big data, it is becoming common to have data with multiple
modalities or coming from multiple sources, known as &quot;multi-view data&quot;.
Multi-view data are usually unlabeled and come from high-dimensional spaces
(such as language vocabularies), unsupervised multi-view feature selection is
crucial to many applications. However, it is nontrivial due to the following
challenges. First, there are too many instances or the feature dimensionality
is too large. Thus, the data may not fit in memory. How to select useful
features with limited memory space? Second, how to select features from
streaming data and handles the concept drift? Third, how to leverage the
consistent and complementary information from different views to improve the
feature selection in the situation when the data are too big or come in as
streams? To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous works can solve all
the challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an Online unsupervised
Multi-View Feature Selection, OMVFS, which deals with large-scale/streaming
multi-view data in an online fashion. OMVFS embeds unsupervised feature
selection into a clustering algorithm via NMF with sparse learning. It further
incorporates the graph regularization to preserve the local structure
information and help select discriminative features. Instead of storing all the
historical data, OMVFS processes the multi-view data chunk by chunk and
aggregates all the necessary information into several small matrices. By using
the buffering technique, the proposed OMVFS can reduce the computational and
storage cost while taking advantage of the structure information. Furthermore,
OMVFS can capture the concept drifts in the data streams. Extensive experiments
on four real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed OMVFS method. More importantly, OMVFS is about 100 times faster than
the off-line methods.

 <dc:description>  Recently, the Fisher vector representation of local features has attracted
much attention because of its effectiveness in both image classification and
image retrieval. Another trend in the area of image retrieval is the use of
binary features such as ORB, FREAK, and BRISK. Considering the significant
performance improvement for accuracy in both image classification and retrieval
by the Fisher vector of continuous feature descriptors, if the Fisher vector
were also to be applied to binary features, we would receive similar benefits
in binary feature based image retrieval and classification. In this paper, we
derive the closed-form approximation of the Fisher vector of binary features
modeled by the Bernoulli mixture model. We also propose accelerating the Fisher
vector by using the approximate value of posterior probability. Experiments
show that the Fisher vector representation significantly improves the accuracy
of image retrieval compared with a bag of binary words approach.

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on the problem of separately modulating and jointly
estimating two independent continuous-valued parameters sent over a Gaussian
multiple-access channel (MAC) under the mean square error (MSE) criterion. To
this end, we first improve an existing lower bound on the MSE that is obtained
using the parameter modulation-estimation techniques for the single-user
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. As for the main contribution of
this work, this improved modulation-estimation analysis is generalized to the
model of the two-user Gaussian MAC, which will likely become an important
mathematical framework for the analysis of remote sensing problems in wireless
networks. We present outer bounds to the achievable region in the plane of the
MSEs of the two user parameters, which provides a trade-off between the MSEs,
in addition to the upper bounds on the achievable region of the MSE exponents,
namely, the exponential decay rates of these MSEs in the asymptotic regime of
long blocks.

 <dc:description>  The feature-selection problem is formulated from an information-theoretic
perspective. We show that the problem can be efficiently solved by an extension
of the recently proposed info-clustering paradigm. This reveals the fundamental
duality between feature selection and data clustering,which is a consequence of
the more general duality between the principal partition and the principal
lattice of partitions in combinatorial optimization.

 <dc:description>  We present an unsupervised method for co-segmentation of a set of 3D shapes
from the same class with the aim of segmenting the input shapes into consistent
semantic parts and establishing their correspondence across the set. Starting
from meaningful pre-segmentation of all given shapes individually, we construct
the correspondence between same candidate parts and obtain the labels via
functional maps. And then, we use these labels to mark the input shapes and
obtain results of co-segmentation. The core of our algorithm is to seek for an
optimal correspondence between semantically similar parts through functional
maps and mark such shape parts. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets
show the efficiency of this method and comparable accuracy to the
state-of-the-art algorithms.

 <dc:description>  With the fast development of deep learning, it has become common to learn big
neural networks using massive training data. Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient
Descent (ASGD) is widely adopted to fulfill this task for its efficiency, which
is, however, known to suffer from the problem of delayed gradients. That is,
when a local worker adds its gradient to the global model, the global model may
have been updated by other workers and this gradient becomes &quot;delayed&quot;. We
propose a novel technology to compensate this delay, so as to make the
optimization behavior of ASGD closer to that of sequential SGD. This is
achieved by leveraging Taylor expansion of the gradient function and efficient
approximation to the Hessian matrix of the loss function. We call the new
algorithm Delay Compensated ASGD (DC-ASGD). We evaluated the proposed algorithm
on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate
that DC-ASGD outperforms both synchronous SGD and asynchronous SGD, and nearly
approaches the performance of sequential SGD.

 <dc:title>Secret Key Generation over Noisy Channels with Common Randomness</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the problem of secret key generation over a wiretap
channel when the terminals observe correlated sources. These sources may or may
not be independent of the main channel and the users overhear them before the
transmission takes place. A novel achievable scheme for the case of independent
sources is proposed, and it is shown to be optimal under certain less noisy
conditions. This result improves upon the existing literature where the more
stringent condition of degradedness was needed. For the situation where the
sources are correlated with the main channel, a second achievable scheme based
on joint source-channel coding is introduced, for which special cases of binary
and Gaussian channels are studied. Some optimality results are derived,
however, these are much less general than for the first setup.

 <dc:title>Bounds on Traceability Schemes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gu, Yujie</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Miao, Ying</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Stinson-Wei traceability scheme (known as traceability scheme) was
proposed for broadcast encryption as a generalization of the Chor-Fiat-Naor
traceability scheme (known as traceability code). Cover-free family was
introduced by Kautz and Singleton in the context of binary superimposed code.
In this paper, we find a new relationship between a traceability scheme and a
cover-free family, which strengthens the anti-collusion strength from $t$ to
$t^2$, that is, a $t$-traceability scheme is a $t^2$-cover-free family. Based
on this interesting discovery, we derive new upper bounds for traceability
schemes. By using combinatorial structures, we construct several infinite
families of optimal traceability schemes which attain our new upper bounds. We
also provide a constructive lower bound for traceability schemes, the size of
which has the same order with our general upper bound. Meanwhile, we consider
parent-identifying set system, an anti-collusion key-distributing scheme
requiring weaker conditions than traceability scheme but stronger conditions
than cover-free family. A new upper bound is also given for parent-identifying
set systems.

 <dc:description>  Research on multilingual speech recognition remains attractive yet
challenging. Recent studies focus on learning shared structures under the
multi-task paradigm, in particular a feature sharing structure. This approach
has been found effective to improve performance on each individual language.
However, this approach is only useful when the deployed system supports just
one language. In a true multilingual scenario where multiple languages are
allowed, performance will be significantly reduced due to the competition among
languages in the decoding space. This paper presents a multi-task recurrent
model that involves a multilingual speech recognition (ASR) component and a
language recognition (LR) component, and the ASR component is informed of the
language information by the LR component, leading to a language-aware
recognition. We tested the approach on an English-Chinese bilingual recognition
task. The results show that the proposed multi-task recurrent model can improve
performance of multilingual recognition systems.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The application of psychophysiological measures in human-computer interaction
is a growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised
systems. Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of
physiological signals and analysis techniques. An important aspect in measuring
psychophysiological variables in real-world settings is the invasiveness of the
measurement setup. Video is a signal which can be captured from a distance
without interrupting the subject. Furthermore, the advancements in camera
technologies enable detecting a growing variety of psychophysiological
phenomena from a video signal with an increasing accuracy. This paper aims to
serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid familiarisation with the
latest core concepts. We put special emphasis on everyday human-computer
interface applications to distinguish from the more common clinical or sports
uses of psychophysiology.

 <dc:description>  The number of methods available for classification of multi-label data has
increased rapidly over recent years, yet relatively few links have been made
with the related task of classification of sequential data. If labels indices
are considered as time indices, the problems can often be seen as equivalent.
In this paper we detect and elaborate on connections between multi-label
methods and Markovian models, and study the suitability of multi-label methods
for prediction in sequential data. From this study we draw upon the most
suitable techniques from the area and develop two novel competitive approaches
which can be applied to either kind of data. We carry out an empirical
evaluation investigating performance on real-world sequential-prediction tasks:
electricity demand, and route prediction. As well as showing that several
popular multi-label algorithms are in fact easily applicable to sequencing
tasks, our novel approaches, which benefit from a unified view of these areas,
prove very competitive against established methods.

 <dc:description>  Many real-world networks exhibit a high degeneracy at few eigenvalues. We
show that a simple transformation of the network's adjacency matrix provides an
understanding of the origins of occurrence of high multiplicities in the
networks spectra. We find that the eigenvectors associated with the degenerate
eigenvalues shed light on the structures contributing to the degeneracy. Since
these degeneracies are rarely observed in model graphs, we present results for
various cancer networks. This approach gives an opportunity to search for
structures contributing to degeneracy which might have an important role in a
network.

 <dc:description>  Many current natural language processing applications for social media rely
on representation learning and utilize pre-trained word embeddings. There
currently exist several publicly-available, pre-trained sets of word
embeddings, but they contain few or no emoji representations even as emoji
usage in social media has increased. In this paper we release emoji2vec,
pre-trained embeddings for all Unicode emoji which are learned from their
description in the Unicode emoji standard. The resulting emoji embeddings can
be readily used in downstream social natural language processing applications
alongside word2vec. We demonstrate, for the downstream task of sentiment
analysis, that emoji embeddings learned from short descriptions outperforms a
skip-gram model trained on a large collection of tweets, while avoiding the
need for contexts in which emoji need to appear frequently in order to estimate
a representation.

 <dc:description>  The theory of quantum games permits players to choose strategies that prepare
and measure quantum states. Whereas conventional game theory provides
guarantees for fixed-point stability in non-cooperative games, so-called Nash
equilibria, we find this guarantee is not provided for quantum games. In
particular, we show the conditions for Glickberg's fixed-point theorem do not
apply to pure quantum games when the payoff is a physical observable. We
further show that Nash equilibrium can be guaranteed when the payoff is defined
with respect to state preparation.

 <dc:description>  The main objective of this project is to segment different breast ultrasound
images to find out lesion area by discarding the low contrast regions as well
as the inherent speckle noise. The proposed method consists of three stages
(removing noise, segmentation, classification) in order to extract the correct
lesion. We used normalized cuts approach to segment ultrasound images into
regions of interest where we can possibly finds the lesion, and then K-means
classifier is applied to decide finally the location of the lesion. For every
original image, an annotated ground-truth image is given to perform comparison
with the obtained experimental results, providing accurate evaluation measures.

 <dc:description>  Streams, or infinite sequences, are infinite objects of a very simple type,
yet they have a rich theory partly due to their ubiquity in mathematics and
computer science. Stream differential equations are a coinductive method for
specifying streams and stream operations, and their theory has been developed
in many papers over the past two decades. In this paper we present a survey of
the many results in this area. Our focus is on the classification of different
formats of stream differential equations, their solution methods, and the
classes of streams they can define. Moreover, we describe in detail the
connection between the so-called syntactic solution method and abstract GSOS.

 <dc:description>  The rate at which nodes in evolving social networks acquire links (friends,
citations) shows complex temporal dynamics. Preferential attachment and link
copying models, while enabling elegant analysis, only capture rich-gets-richer
effects, not aging and decline. Recent aging models are complex and heavily
parameterized; most involve estimating 1-3 parameters per node. These
parameters are intrinsic: they explain decline in terms of events in the past
of the same node, and do not explain, using the network, where the linking
attention might go instead. We argue that traditional characterization of
linking dynamics are insufficient to judge the faithfulness of models. We
propose a new temporal sketch of an evolving graph, and introduce several new
characterizations of a network's temporal dynamics. Then we propose a new
family of frugal aging models with no per-node parameters and only two global
parameters. Our model is based on a surprising inversion or undoing of triangle
completion, where an old node relays a citation to a younger follower in its
immediate vicinity. Despite very few parameters, the new family of models shows
remarkably better fit with real data. Before concluding, we analyze temporal
signatures for various research communities yielding further insights into
their comparative dynamics. To facilitate reproducible research, we shall soon
make all the codes and the processed dataset available in the public domain.

 <dc:description>  The trade-off between coarse- and fine-grained locking is a well understood
issue in operating systems. Coarse-grained locking provides lower overhead
under low contention, fine-grained locking provides higher scalability under
contention, though at the expense of implementation complexity and re- duced
best-case performance.
  We revisit this trade-off in the context of microkernels and tightly-coupled
cores with shared caches and low inter-core migration latencies. We evaluate
performance on two architectures: x86 and ARM MPCore, in the former case also
utilising transactional memory (Intel TSX). Our thesis is that on such
hardware, a well-designed microkernel, with short system calls, can take
advantage of coarse-grained locking on modern hardware, avoid the run-time and
complexity cost of multiple locks, enable formal verification, and still
achieve scalability comparable to fine-grained locking.

 <dc:description>  The society has a multi-layered structure, where the layers represent the
different contexts. To model this structure we begin with a single-layer
weighted social network (WSN) model showing the Granovetterian structure. We
find that when merging such WSN models, a sufficient amount of inter-layer
correlation is needed to maintain the relationship between topology and link
weights, while these correlations destroy the enhancement in the community
overlap due to multiple layers. To resolve this, we devise a geographic
multi-layer WSN model, where the indirect inter-layer correlations due to the
geographic constraints of individuals enhance the overlaps between the
communities and, at the same time, the Granovetterian structure is preserved.
Furthermore, the network of social interactions can be considered as a
multiplex from another point of view too: each layer corresponds to one
communication channel and the aggregate of all them constitutes the entire
social network. However, usually one has information only about one of the
channels, which should be considered as a sample of the whole. Here we show by
simulations and analytical methods that this sampling may lead to bias. For
example, while it is expected that the degree distribution of the whole social
network has a maximum at a value larger than one, we get with reasonable
assumptions about the sampling process a monotonously decreasing distribution
as observed in empirical studies of single channel data. We analyse the
far-reaching consequences of our findings.

 <dc:description>  Second order total variation (SOTV) models have advantages for image
reconstruction over their first order counterparts including their ability to
remove the staircase artefact in the reconstructed image, but they tend to blur
the reconstructed image. To overcome this drawback, we introduce a new Tensor
Weighted Second Order (TWSO) model for image reconstruction. Specifically, we
develop a novel regulariser for the SOTV model that uses the Frobenius norm of
the product of the SOTV Hessian matrix and the anisotropic tensor. We then
adapt the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the
proposed model by breaking down the original problem into several subproblems.
All the subproblems have closed-forms and can thus be solved efficiently. The
proposed method is compared with a range of state-of-the-art approaches such as
tensor-based anisotropic diffusion, total generalised variation, Euler's
elastica, etc. Numerical experimental results of the method on both synthetic
and real images from the Berkeley database BSDS500 demonstrate that the
proposed method eliminates both the staircase and blurring effects and
outperforms the existing approaches for image inpainting and denoising
applications.

into different uniform color plans. The practical application is dedicated to
administrative documents segmentation. In these documents, like in many other

performed on the much bigger set as a batch. Our experiments show very

 <dc:description>  New methods for solving the college admissions problem with indifference are
presented and characterised with a Monte Carlo simulation in a variety of
simple scenarios. Based on a qualifier defined as the average rank, it is found
that these methods are more efficient than the Boston and Deferred Acceptance

 <dc:description>  Many model based scientific and engineering methodologies, such as system
identification, sensitivity analysis, optimization and control, require a large
number of model evaluations. In particular, model based real-time control of
urban water infrastructures and online flood alarm systems require fast
prediction of the network response at different actuation and/or parameter
values. General purpose urban drainage simulators are too slow for this
application. Fast surrogate models, so-called emulators, provide a solution to
this efficiency demand. Emulators are attractive, because they sacrifice
unneeded accuracy in favor of speed. However, they have to be fine-tuned to
predict the system behavior satisfactorily. Also, some emulators fail to
extrapolate the system behavior beyond the training set. Although, there are
many strategies for developing emulators, up until now the selection of the
emulation strategy remains subjective. In this paper, we therefore compare the
performance of two families of emulators for open channel flows in the context
of urban drainage simulators. We compare emulators that explicitly use
knowledge of the simulator's equations, i.e. mechanistic emulators based on
Gaussian Processes, with purely data-driven emulators using matrix
factorization. Our results suggest that in many urban applications, naive
data-driven emulation outperforms mechanistic emulation. Nevertheless, we
discuss scenarios in which we think that mechanistic emulation might be
favorable for i) extrapolation in time and ii) dealing with sparse and unevenly
sampled data. We also provide many references to advances in the field of
Machine Learning that have not yet permeated into the Bayesian environmental
science community.

 <dc:description>  Many machine learning tasks can be formulated as Regularized Empirical Risk
Minimization (R-ERM), and solved by optimization algorithms such as gradient
descent (GD), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and stochastic variance
reduction (SVRG). Conventional analysis on these optimization algorithms
focuses on their convergence rates during the training process, however, people
in the machine learning community may care more about the generalization
performance of the learned model on unseen test data. In this paper, we
investigate on this issue, by using stability as a tool. In particular, we
decompose the generalization error for R-ERM, and derive its upper bound for
both convex and non-convex cases. In convex cases, we prove that the
generalization error can be bounded by the convergence rate of the optimization
algorithm and the stability of the R-ERM process, both in expectation (in the
order of $\mathcal{O}((1/n)+\mathbb{E}\rho(T))$, where $\rho(T)$ is the
convergence error and $T$ is the number of iterations) and in high probability
(in the order of
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log{1/\delta}}{\sqrt{n}}+\rho(T)\right)$ with
probability $1-\delta$). For non-convex cases, we can also obtain a similar
expected generalization error bound. Our theorems indicate that 1) along with
the training process, the generalization error will decrease for all the
optimization algorithms under our investigation; 2) Comparatively speaking,
SVRG has better generalization ability than GD and SGD. We have conducted
experiments on both convex and non-convex problems, and the experimental
results verify our theoretical findings.

 <dc:description>  -In cognitive radio networks, spectrum sensing aims to detect the unused
spectrum channels in order to use the radio spectrum more efficiently. Various
methods have been proposed in the past, such as energy, feature detection, and
matched filter. These methods are characterized by a sensing threshold, which
plays an important role in the sensing performance. Most of the existing
techniques used a static threshold. However, the noise is random, and, thus the
threshold should be dynamic. In this paper, we suggest an approach with an
estimated and dynamic sensing threshold to increase the efficiency of the
sensing detection. The matched filter method with dynamic threshold is
simulated and its results are compared to those of other existing techniques.
Keywords-cognitive radio networks; spectrum sensing; energy detection; matched
filter detection; autocorrelation based sensing; estimated dynamic threshold

 <dc:title>House price estimation from visual and textual features</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Most existing automatic house price estimation systems rely only on some
textual data like its neighborhood area and the number of rooms. The final
price is estimated by a human agent who visits the house and assesses it
visually. In this paper, we propose extracting visual features from house
photographs and combining them with the house's textual information. The
combined features are fed to a fully connected multilayer Neural Network (NN)
that estimates the house price as its single output. To train and evaluate our
network, we have collected the first houses dataset (to our knowledge) that
combines both images and textual attributes. The dataset is composed of 535
sample houses from the state of California, USA. Our experiments showed that
adding the visual features increased the R-value by a factor of 3 and decreased
the Mean Square Error (MSE) by one order of magnitude compared with
textual-only features. Additionally, when trained on the benchmark textual-only
features housing dataset, our proposed NN still outperformed the existing model
published results.

 <dc:title>Tight Hardness Results for Distance and Centrality Problems in Constant

 <dc:description>  Finding important nodes in a graph and measuring their importance is a
fundamental problem in the analysis of social networks, transportation
networks, biological systems, etc. Among popular such metrics are graph
centrality, betweenness centrality (BC), and reach centrality (RC). These
measures are also very related to classic notions like diameter and radius.
Roditty and Vassilevska Williams~[STOC'13] showed that no algorithm can compute
a (3/2-\delta)-approximation of the diameter in sparse and unweighted graphs
faster that n^{2-o(1)} time unless the widely believed strong exponential time
hypothesis (SETH) is false. Abboud et al.~[SODA'15] and [SODA'16] further
analyzed these problems under the recent line of research on hardness in P.
They showed that in sparse and unweighted graphs (weighted for BC) none of
these problems can be solved faster than n^{2-o(1)} unless some popular
conjecture is false. Furthermore they ruled out a (2-\delta)-approximation for
RC, a (3/2-\delta)-approximation for Radius and a (5/3-\delta)-approximation
for computing all eccentricities of a graph for any \delta &gt; 0. We extend these
results to the case of unweighted graphs with constant maximum degree. Through
new graph constructions we are able to obtain the same approximation and time
bounds as for sparse graphs even in unweighted bounded-degree graphs. We show
that no (3/2-\delta) approximation of Radius or Diameter,
(2-\delta)-approximation of RC, (5/3-\delta)-approximation of all
eccentricities or exact algorithm for BC exists in time n^{2-o(1)} for such
graphs and any \delta &gt; 0. This strengthens the result for BC of Abboud et
al.~[SODA'16] by showing a hardness result for unweighted graphs, and follows
in the footsteps of Abboud et al.~[SODA'16] and Abboud and Dahlgaard~[FOCS'16]
in showing conditional lower bounds for restricted but realistic graph classes.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work focuses on reliable detection of bird sound emissions as recorded
in the open field. Acoustic detection of avian sounds can be used for the
automatized monitoring of multiple bird taxa and querying in long-term
recordings for species of interest for researchers, conservation practitioners,
and decision makers. Recordings in the wild can be very noisy due to the
exposure of the microphones to a large number of audio sources originating from
all distances and directions, the number and identity of which cannot be known
a-priori. The co-existence of the target vocalizations with abiotic
interferences in an unconstrained environment is inefficiently treated by
current approaches of audio signal enhancement. A technique that would spot
only bird vocalization while ignoring other audio sources is of prime
importance. These difficulties are tackled in this work, presenting a deep
autoencoder that maps the audio spectrogram of bird vocalizations to its
corresponding binary mask that encircles the spectral blobs of vocalizations
while suppressing other audio sources. The procedure requires minimum human
attendance, it is very fast during execution, thus suitable to scan massive
volumes of data, in order to analyze them, evaluate insights and hypotheses,
identify patterns of bird activity that, hopefully, finally lead to design
policies on biodiversity issues.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by the need to automate medical information extraction from
free-text radiological reports, we present a bi-directional long short-term
memory (BiLSTM) neural network architecture for modelling radiological
language. The model has been used to address two NLP tasks: medical
named-entity recognition (NER) and negation detection. We investigate whether
learning several types of word embeddings improves BiLSTM's performance on
those tasks. Using a large dataset of chest x-ray reports, we compare the
proposed model to a baseline dictionary-based NER system and a negation
detection system that leverages the hand-crafted rules of the NegEx algorithm
and the grammatical relations obtained from the Stanford Dependency Parser.
Compared to these more traditional rule-based systems, we argue that BiLSTM
offers a strong alternative for both our tasks.

O-COCOSDA 2016. This database consists of 80 hours of speech signals recorded
from more than 1,400 speakers, where the utterances are in Chinese but each
involves one or several English words. Based on the database and another two
free data resources (THCHS30 and the CMU dictionary), a speech recognition

 <dc:description>  Collision avoidance systems can play a vital role in reducing the number of
accidents and saving human lives. In this paper, we introduce and validate a
novel method for vehicles reactive collision avoidance using evolutionary
neural networks (ENN). A single front-facing rangefinder sensor is the only
input required by our method. The training process and the proposed method
analysis and validation are carried out using simulation. Extensive experiments
are conducted to analyse the proposed method and evaluate its performance.
Firstly, we experiment the ability to learn collision avoidance in a static
free track. Secondly, we analyse the effect of the rangefinder sensor
resolution on the learning process. Thirdly, we experiment the ability of a
vehicle to individually and simultaneously learn collision avoidance. Finally,
we test the generality of the proposed method. We used a more realistic and
powerful simulation environment (CarMaker), a camera as an alternative input
sensor, and lane keeping as an extra feature to learn. The results are
encouraging; the proposed method successfully allows vehicles to learn
collision avoidance in different scenarios that are unseen during training. It
also generalizes well if any of the input sensor, the simulator, or the task to
be learned is changed.

 <dc:description>  In the machine learning problems, the performance measure is used to evaluate
the machine learning models. Recently, the number positive data points ranked
at the top positions (Pos@Top) has been a popular performance measure in the
machine learning community. In this paper, we propose to learn a convolutional
neural network (CNN) model to maximize the Pos@Top performance measure. The CNN
model is used to represent the multi-instance data point, and a classifier
function is used to predict the label from the its CNN representation. We
propose to minimize the loss function of Pos@Top over a training set to learn
the filters of CNN and the classifier parameter. The classifier parameter
vector is solved by the Lagrange multiplier method, and the filters are updated
by the gradient descent method alternately in an iterative algorithm.
Experiments over benchmark data sets show that the proposed method outperforms
the state-of-the-art Pos@Top maximization methods.

 <dc:description>  Decision making is an important component in a speaker verification system.
For the conventional GMM-UBM architecture, the decision is usually conducted
based on the log likelihood ratio of the test utterance against the GMM of the
claimed speaker and the UBM. This single-score decision is simple but tends to
be sensitive to the complex variations in speech signals (e.g. text content,
channel, speaking style, etc.). In this paper, we propose a decision making
approach based on multiple scores derived from a set of cohort GMMs (cohort
scores). Importantly, these cohort scores are not simply averaged as in
conventional cohort methods; instead, we employ a powerful discriminative model
as the decision maker. Experimental results show that the proposed method
delivers substantial performance improvement over the baseline system,
especially when a deep neural network (DNN) is used as the decision maker, and
the DNN input involves some statistical features derived from the cohort
scores.

 <dc:description>  In this article an optimal selection of tap positions for certain LFSR-based
encryption schemes is investigated from both design and cryptanalytic
perspective. Two novel algorithms towards an optimal selection of tap positions
are given which can be satisfactorily used to provide (sub)optimal resistance
to some generic cryptanalytic techniques applicable to these schemes. It is
demonstrated that certain real-life ciphers (e.g. SOBER-t32, SFINKS and
Grain-128), employing some standard criteria for tap selection such as the
concept of full difference set, are not fully optimized with respect to these
attacks. These standard design criteria are quite insufficient and the proposed
algorithms appear to be the only generic method for the purpose of (sub)optimal
selection of tap positions. We also extend the framework of a generic
cryptanalytic method called Generalized Filter State Guessing Attacks (GFSGA),
introduced in [26] as a generalization of the FSGA method, by applying a
variable sampling of the keystream bits in order to retrieve as much
information about the secret state bits as possible. Two different modes that
use a variable sampling of keystream blocks are presented and it is shown that
in many cases these modes may outperform the standard GFSGA mode. We also
demonstrate the possibility of employing GFSGA-like attacks to other design
strategies such as NFSR-based ciphers (Grain family for instance) and filter
generators outputting a single bit each time the cipher is clocked. In
particular, when the latter scenario is considered, the idea of combining GFSGA
technique and algebraic attacks appears to be a promising unified cryptanalytic
method against NFSR-based stream ciphers.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes several nonlinear control strategies for trajectory
tracking of a quadcopter system based on the property of differential flatness.
Its originality is twofold. Firstly, it provides a flat output for the
quadcopter dynamics capable of creating full flat parametrization of the states
and inputs. Moreover, B-splines characterizations of the flat output and their
properties allow for optimal trajectory generation subject to way-point
constraints. Secondly, several control strategies based on computed torque
control and feedback linearization are presented and compared. The advantages
of flatness within each control strategy are analyzed and detailed through
extensive simulation results.

 <dc:title>DESQ: Frequent Sequence Mining with Subsequence Constraints</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Beedkar, Kaustubh</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Frequent sequence mining methods often make use of constraints to control
which subsequences should be mined. A variety of such subsequence constraints
has been studied in the literature, including length, gap, span,
regular-expression, and hierarchy constraints. In this paper, we show that many
subsequence constraints---including and beyond those considered in the
literature---can be unified in a single framework. A unified treatment allows
researchers to study jointly many types of subsequence constraints (instead of
each one individually) and helps to improve usability of pattern mining systems
for practitioners. In more detail, we propose a set of simple and intuitive
&quot;pattern expressions&quot; to describe subsequence constraints and explore
algorithms for efficiently mining frequent subsequences under such general
constraints. Our algorithms translate pattern expressions to compressed finite
state transducers, which we use as computational model, and simulate these
transducers in a way suitable for frequent sequence mining. Our experimental
study on real-world datasets indicates that our algorithms---although more
general---are competitive to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

 <dc:description>  PLDA is a popular normalization approach for the i-vector model, and it has
delivered state-of-the-art performance in speaker verification. However, PLDA
training requires a large amount of labeled development data, which is highly
expensive in most cases. A possible approach to mitigate the problem is various
unsupervised adaptation methods, which use unlabeled data to adapt the PLDA
scattering matrices to the target domain.
  In this paper, we present a new `local training' approach that utilizes
inaccurate but much cheaper local labels to train the PLDA model. These local
labels discriminate speakers within a single conversion only, and so are much
easier to obtain compared to the normal `global labels'. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach can deliver significant performance improvement,
particularly with limited globally-labeled data.

 <dc:description>  Regularized empirical risk minimization (R-ERM) is an important branch of
machine learning, since it constrains the capacity of the hypothesis space and
guarantees the generalization ability of the learning algorithm. Two classic
proximal optimization algorithms, i.e., proximal stochastic gradient descent
(ProxSGD) and proximal stochastic coordinate descent (ProxSCD) have been widely
used to solve the R-ERM problem. Recently, variance reduction technique was
proposed to improve ProxSGD and ProxSCD, and the corresponding ProxSVRG and
ProxSVRCD have better convergence rate. These proximal algorithms with variance
reduction technique have also achieved great success in applications at small
and moderate scales. However, in order to solve large-scale R-ERM problems and
make more practical impacts, the parallel version of these algorithms are
sorely needed. In this paper, we propose asynchronous ProxSVRG (Async-ProxSVRG)
and asynchronous ProxSVRCD (Async-ProxSVRCD) algorithms, and prove that
Async-ProxSVRG can achieve near linear speedup when the training data is
sparse, while Async-ProxSVRCD can achieve near linear speedup regardless of the
sparse condition, as long as the number of block partitions are appropriately
set. We have conducted experiments on a regularized logistic regression task.
The results verified our theoretical findings and demonstrated the practical
efficiency of the asynchronous stochastic proximal algorithms with variance
reduction.

 <dc:description>  The detection of road and free space remains challenging for non-flat plane,
especially with the varying latitudinal and longitudinal slope or in the case
of multi-ground plane. In this paper, we propose a framework of the ground
plane detection with stereo vision. The main contribution of this paper is a
newly proposed descriptor which is implemented in the disparity image to obtain
a disparity texture image. The ground plane regions can be distinguished from
their surroundings effectively in the disparity texture image. Because the
descriptor is implemented in the local area of the image, it can address well
the problem of non-flat plane. And we also present a complete framework to
detect the ground plane regions base on the disparity texture image with
convolutional neural network architecture.

 <dc:title>Enhancing Big Data in the Social Sciences with Crowdsourcing: Data
  Augmentation Practices, Techniques, and Opportunities</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The importance of big data is a contested topic among social scientists.
Proponents claim it will fuel a research revolution, but skeptics challenge it
as unreliably measured and decontextualized, with limited utility for
accurately answering social science research questions. We argue that social
scientists need effective tools to quantify big data's measurement error and
expand the contextual information associated with it. Standard research efforts
in many fields already pursue these goals through data augmentation, the
systematic assessment of measurement against known quantities and expansion of
extant data by adding new information. Traditionally, these tasks are
accomplished using trained research assistants or specialized algorithms.
However, such approaches may not be scalable to big data or appease its
skeptics. We consider a third alternative that may increase the validity and
value of big data: data augmentation with online crowdsourcing. We present
three empirical cases to illustrate the strengths and limits of crowdsourcing
for academic research, with a particular eye to how they can be applied to data
augmentation tasks that will accelerate acceptance of big data among social
scientists. The cases use Amazon Mechanical Turk to 1. verify automated coding
of the academic discipline of dissertation committee members, 2. link online
product pages to a book database, and 3. gather data on mental health resources
at colleges. In light of these cases, we consider the costs and benefits of
augmenting big data with crowdsourcing marketplaces and provide guidelines on
best practices. We also offer a standardized reporting template that will
enhance reproducibility.

 <dc:title>Flows Generating Nonlinear Eigenfunctions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Nonlinear variational methods have become very powerful tools for many image
processing tasks. Recently a new line of research has emerged, dealing with
nonlinear eigenfunctions induced by convex functionals. This has provided new
insights and better theoretical understanding of convex regularization and
introduced new processing methods. However, the theory of nonlinear eigenvalue
problems is still at its infancy. We present a new flow that can generate
nonlinear eigenfunctions of the form $T(u)=\lambda u$, where $T(u)$ is a
nonlinear operator and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R} $ is the eigenvalue. We develop
the theory where $T(u)$ is a subgradient element of a regularizing
one-homogeneous functional, such as total-variation (TV) or
total-generalized-variation (TGV). We introduce two flows: a forward flow and
an inverse flow; for which the steady state solution is a nonlinear
eigenfunction. The forward flow monotonically smooths the solution (with
respect to the regularizer) and simultaneously increases the $L^2$ norm. The
inverse flow has the opposite characteristics. For both flows, the steady state
depends on the initial condition, thus different initial conditions yield
different eigenfunctions. This enables a deeper investigation into the space of
nonlinear eigenfunctions, allowing to produce numerically diverse examples,
which may be unknown yet. In addition we suggest an indicator to measure the
affinity of a function to an eigenfunction and relate it to
pseudo-eigenfunctions in the linear case.

 <dc:description>  Robotic code needs to be verified to ensure its safety and functional
correctness, especially when the robot is interacting with people. Testing real
code in simulation is a viable option. However, generating tests that cover
rare scenarios, as well as exercising most of the code, is a challenge
amplified by the complexity of the interactions between the environment and the
software. Model-based test generation methods can automate otherwise manual
processes and facilitate reaching rare scenarios during testing. In this paper,
we compare using Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents as models for test
generation with more conventional automata-based techniques that exploit model
checking, in terms of practicality, performance, transferability to different
scenarios, and exploration (`coverage'), through two case studies: a
cooperative manufacturing task, and a home care scenario. The results highlight
the advantages of using BDI agents for test generation. BDI agents naturally
emulate the agency present in Human-Robot Interactions (HRIs), and are thus
more expressive than automata. The performance of the BDI-based test generation
is at least as high, and the achieved coverage is higher or equivalent,
compared to test generation based on model checking automata.

 <dc:description>  PLDA is a popular normalization approach for the i-vector model, and it has
delivered state-of-the-art performance in speaker verification. However, PLDA
training requires a large amount of labelled development data, which is highly
expensive in most cases. We present a cheap PLDA training approach, which
assumes that speakers in the same session can be easily separated, and speakers
in different sessions are simply different. This results in `weak labels' which
are not fully accurate but cheap, leading to a weak PLDA training.
  Our experimental results on real-life large-scale telephony customer service
achieves demonstrated that the weak training can offer good performance when
human-labelled data are limited. More interestingly, the weak training can be
employed as a discriminative adaptation approach, which is more efficient than
the prevailing unsupervised method when human-labelled data are insufficient.

recognition simultaneously and altogether. The model is based on a multi-task
recurrent neural network where the output of one task is fed as the input of
the other, leading to a collaborative learning framework that can improve both
language and speaker recognition by borrowing information from each other. Our
experiments demonstrated that the multi-task model outperforms the
task-specific models on both tasks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce an informative path planning (IPP) framework for
active classification using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Our algorithm uses
a combination of global viewpoint selection and evolutionary optimization to
refine the planned trajectory in continuous 3D space while satisfying dynamic
constraints. Our approach is evaluated on the application of weed detection for
precision agriculture. We model the presence of weeds on farmland using an
occupancy grid and generate adaptive plans according to information-theoretic
objectives, enabling the UAV to gather data efficiently. We validate our
approach in simulation by comparing against existing methods, and study the
effects of different planning strategies. Our results show that the proposed
algorithm builds maps with over 50% lower entropy compared to traditional
&quot;lawnmower&quot; coverage in the same amount of time. We demonstrate the planning
scheme on a multirotor platform with different artificial farmland set-ups.

 <dc:description>  While the possibility of time travel in physics is still debated, the
explosive growth of virtual-reality simulations opens up new possibilities to
rigorously explore such time travel and its consequences in the digital domain.
Here we provide a computational model of time travel and a computer program
that allows exploring digital time travel. In order to explain our method we
formalize a simplified version of the famous grandfather paradox, show how the
system can allow the participant to go back in time, try to kill their
ancestors before they were born, and experience the consequences. The system
has even come up with scenarios that can be considered consistent &quot;solutions&quot;
of the grandfather paradox. We discuss the conditions for digital time travel,
which indicate that it has a large number of practical applications.

 <dc:description>  A semi-centralized joint cell muting and user scheduling scheme for
interference coordination in a multicell network is proposed under two
different temporal fairness criteria. The main principle behind the proposed
scheme is that a central entity selects a cell muting pattern out of a pattern
set at a decision instant, and subsequently the un-muted base stations
opportunistically schedule the users in the associated cells, both decisions
made on a temporal-fair basis. Although some pattern sets are easily obtainable
from static frequency reuse systems, we propose a more general pattern set
construction algorithm in this paper. As for the first fairness criterion, all
cells are assigned to receive the same temporal share with the ratio between
the temporal share of a cell center section and that of the cell edge section
is set to a fixed desired value for all cells. The second fairness criterion is
based on the max-min temporal fairness for which the temporal share of the
network-wide worst-case user is maximized. Numerical results are provided to
validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for both criteria. The impact
of choice of the cell muting pattern set is also studied through numerical
examples for various cellular topologies.

NP-hard Orienteering Problem (OP) asks to find a path from a source to a
destination maximizing the accumulated value while not exceeding a cost budget.
Variations of the OP and AOP have many practical applications such as mobile
crowdsourcing tasks (e.g., repairing and maintenance or dispatching field
workers), diverse logistics problems (e.g., crowd control or controlling
wildfires) as well as several tourist guidance problems (e.g., generating trip
recommendations or navigating through theme parks). In the proposed 2TD-AOP,
travel times and value functions are assumed to be time-dependent. The dynamic
values model, for instance, varying rewards in crowdsourcing tasks or varying
urgency levels in damage control tasks. We discuss this novel problem, prove
the benefit of time-dependence empirically and present an efficient
approximative solution, optimized for fast response systems. Our approach is
the first time-dependent variant of the AOP to be evaluated on a large scale,
fine-grained, real-world road network. We show that optimal solutions are
infeasible and solutions to the static problem are often invalid. We propose an
approximate dynamic programming solution which produces valid paths and is
orders of magnitude faster than any optimal solution.

 <dc:description>  Energy is often the most constrained resource for battery-powered wireless
devices and the lion's share of energy is often spent on transceiver usage
(sending/receiving packets), not on computation. In this paper we study the
energy complexity of LeaderElection and ApproximateCounting in several models
of wireless radio networks. It turns out that energy complexity is very
sensitive to whether the devices can generate random bits and their ability to
detect collisions. We consider four collision-detection models: Strong-CD (in
which transmitters and listeners detect collisions), Sender-CD and Receiver-CD
(in which only transmitters or only listeners detect collisions), and No-CD (in
which no one detects collisions.)
  The take-away message of our results is quite surprising. For randomized
LeaderElection algorithms, there is an exponential gap between the energy
complexity of Sender-CD and Receiver-CD, and for deterministic LeaderElection
algorithms there is another exponential gap, but in the reverse direction.
  In particular, the randomized energy complexity of LeaderElection is
$\Theta(\log^* n)$ in Sender-CD but $\Theta(\log(\log^* n))$ in Receiver-CD,
where $n$ is the (unknown) number of devices. Its deterministic complexity is
$\Theta(\log N)$ in Receiver-CD but $\Theta(\log\log N)$ in Sender-CD, where
$N$ is the (known) size of the devices' ID space.
  There is a tradeoff between time and energy. We give a new upper bound on the
time-energy tradeoff curve for randomized LeaderElection and
ApproximateCounting. A critical component of this algorithm is a new
deterministic LeaderElection algorithm for dense instances, when $n=\Theta(N)$,
with inverse-Ackermann-type ($O(\alpha(N))$) energy complexity.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes our system, dubbed WS4A (Web Services for All), that
participated in the fourth edition of the BioASQ challenge (2016). We used WS4A
to perform the Question and Answering (QA) task 4b, which consisted on the
retrieval of relevant concepts, documents, snippets, RDF triples, exact answers
and ideal answers for each given question. The novelty in our approach consists
on the maximum exploitation of existing web services in each step of WS4A, such
as the annotation of text, and the retrieval of metadata for each annotation.
The information retrieved included concept identifiers, ontologies, ancestors,
and most importantly, PubMed identifiers. The paper describes the WS4A pipeline
and also presents the precision, recall and f-measure values obtained in task
4b. Our system achieved two second places in two subtasks on one of the five
batches.

 <dc:description>  Inferring topics from the overwhelming amount of short texts becomes a
critical but challenging task for many content analysis tasks, such as content
charactering, user interest profiling, and emerging topic detecting. Existing
methods such as probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) and latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA) cannot solve this prob- lem very well since only
very limited word co-occurrence information is available in short texts. This
paper studies how to incorporate the external word correlation knowledge into
short texts to improve the coherence of topic modeling. Based on recent results
in word embeddings that learn se- mantically representations for words from a
large corpus, we introduce a novel method, Embedding-based Topic Model (ETM),
to learn latent topics from short texts. ETM not only solves the problem of
very limited word co-occurrence information by aggregating short texts into
long pseudo- texts, but also utilizes a Markov Random Field regularized model
that gives correlated words a better chance to be put into the same topic. The
experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our model
comparing with the state-of-the-art models.

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on cognitive radio (CR) internet- of-things (IoT) networks
where spectrum sensors are deployed for IoT CR devices, which do not have
enough hardware capability to identify an unoccupied spectrum by themselves. In
this sensor- enabled IoT CR network, the CR devices and the sensors are
separated. It induces that spectrum occupancies at locations of CR devices and
sensors could be different. To handle this difference, we investigate a
conditional interference distribution (CID) at the CR device for a given
measured interference at the sensor. We can observe a spatial correlation of
the aggregate interference distribution through the CID. Reflecting the CID, we
devise a cognitive random access scheme which adaptively adjusts transmission
probability with respect to the interference measurement of the sensor. Our
scheme improves area spectral efficiency (ASE) compared to a conventional ALOHA
and an adaptive transmission scheme which attempts to send data when the sensor
measurement is lower than an interference threshold.

 <dc:description>  We extend randomized jumplists introduced by Br\&quot;onnimann et al. (STACS 2003)
to choose jump-pointer targets as median of a small sample, and present
randomized algorithms with expected $O(\log n)$ time complexity that maintain
the probability distribution of jump pointers upon insertions and deletions. We
analyze the expected costs to search, insert and delete a random element. The
resulting data structure, randomized median-of-$k$ jumplists, is competitive to
other dictionary implementations and supports particularly efficient iteration
in sorted order and selection by rank. We further show that omitting jump
pointers in small sublists hardly affects search costs, but significantly
reduces the memory consumption. If space is tight and rank-select is needed,
median-of-$k$ jumplists are a promising option in practice.

 <dc:description>  Excess freedom in how computers are used creates problems that include: bit
rot, problems with big data, problems in the creation and debugging of
software, and problems with cyber security. To tame excess freedom, &quot;tough
love&quot; is needed in the form of a {\em universal framework for the
representation and processing of diverse kinds of knowledge} (UFK). The &quot;SP
machine&quot;, based on the &quot;SP theory of intelligence&quot;, has the potential to
provide that framework and to help solve the problems above. There is potential
to reduce the near-4000 different kinds of computer file to one, and to reduce
the hundreds of different computer languages to one.

 <dc:description>  Phaseless super-resolution refers to the problem of superresolving a signal
from only its low-frequency Fourier magnitude measurements. In this paper, we
consider the phaseless super-resolution problem of recovering a sum of sparse
Dirac delta functions which can be located anywhere in the continuous
time-domain. For such signals in the continuous domain, we propose a novel
Semidefinite Programming (SDP) based signal recovery method to achieve the
phaseless superresolution. This work extends the recent work of Jaganathan et
al. [1], which considered phaseless super-resolution for discrete signals on
the grid.

Specifically, we propose to use the Bash terminal as a simulator of the Ubuntu
environment for a learning-based agent and demonstrate the usefulness of
adopting reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for basic problem solving and
troubleshooting in this environment. We provide a plug-and-play interface to
the simulator as a python package where different types of agents can be

Finally, we show that the use of this data significantly improves the agent's

 <dc:description>  This paper uses a case study to evaluate empirically three formalisms of
different kinds for their suitability for the modelling and analysis of dynamic
reconfiguration of dependable systems. The requirements on an ideal formalism
for dynamic software reconfiguration are defined. The reconfiguration of an
office workflow for order processing is described, and the requirements on the
reconfiguration of the workflow are defined. The workflow is modelled using the
Vienna Development Method ($\mathrm{VDM}$), conditional partial order graphs
($\mathrm{CPOGs}$), and the basic Calculus of Communicating Systems for dynamic
process reconfiguration (basic $\mathrm{CCS^{dp}}$), and verification of the
reconfiguration requirements is attempted using the models. The formalisms are
evaluated according to their ability to model the reconfiguration of the
workflow, to verify the requirements on the workflow's reconfiguration, and to
meet the requirements on an ideal formalism.

 <dc:description>  The advent of mobile health technologies presents new challenges that
existing visualizations, interactive tools, and algorithms are not yet designed
to support. In dealing with uncertainty in sensor data and high-dimensional
physiological records, we must seek to improve current tools that make sense of
health data from traditional perspectives in event-based trend discovery. With
Chronodes, a system developed to help researchers collect, interpret, and model
mobile health (mHealth) data, we posit a series of interaction techniques that
enable new approaches to understanding and exploring event-based data. From
numerous and discontinuous mobile health data streams, Chronodes finds and
visualizes frequent event sequences that reveal common chronological patterns
across participants and days. By then promoting the sequences as interactive
elements, Chronodes presents opportunities for finding, defining, and comparing
cohorts of participants that exhibit particular behaviors. We applied Chronodes
to a real 40GB mHealth dataset capturing about 400 hours of data. Through our
pilot study with 20 behavioral and biomedical health experts, we gained
insights into Chronodes' efficacy, limitations, and potential applicability to
a wide range of healthcare scenarios.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we focus on activating only a few sensors, among many
available, to estimate the state of a stochastic process of interest. This
problem is important in applications such as target tracking and simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM). It is challenging since it involves stochastic
systems whose evolution is largely unknown, sensors with nonlinear
measurements, and limited operational resources that constrain the number of
active sensors at each measurement step. We provide an algorithm applicable to
general stochastic processes and nonlinear measurements whose time complexity
is linear in the planning horizon and whose performance is a multiplicative
factor 1/2 away from the optimal performance. This is notable because the
algorithm offers a significant computational advantage over the polynomial-time
algorithm that achieves the best approximation factor 1/e. In addition, for
important classes of Gaussian processes and nonlinear measurements corrupted
with Gaussian noise, our algorithm enjoys the same time complexity as even the
state-of-the-art algorithms for linear systems and measurements. We achieve our
results by proving two properties for the entropy of the batch state vector
conditioned on the measurements: a) it is supermodular in the choice of the
sensors; b) it has a sparsity pattern (involves block tri-diagonal matrices)
that facilitates its evaluation at each sensor set.

 <dc:description>  This work provides an architecture to enable robotic grasp planning via shape
completion. Shape completion is accomplished through the use of a 3D
convolutional neural network (CNN). The network is trained on our own new open
source dataset of over 440,000 3D exemplars captured from varying viewpoints.
At runtime, a 2.5D pointcloud captured from a single point of view is fed into
the CNN, which fills in the occluded regions of the scene, allowing grasps to
be planned and executed on the completed object. Runtime shape completion is
very rapid because most of the computational costs of shape completion are
borne during offline training. We explore how the quality of completions vary
based on several factors. These include whether or not the object being
completed existed in the training data and how many object models were used to
train the network. We also look at the ability of the network to generalize to
novel objects allowing the system to complete previously unseen objects at
runtime. Finally, experimentation is done both in simulation and on actual
robotic hardware to explore the relationship between completion quality and the
utility of the completed mesh model for grasping.

 <dc:description>  Table (database) / Relational database Classification for big/smart/fast data
machine learning is one of the most important tasks of predictive analytics and
extracting valuable information from data. It is core applied technique for
what now understood under data science and/or artificial intelligence. Widely
used Decision Tree (Random Forest) and rare used rule based PRISM , VFST, etc
classifiers are empirical substitutions of theoretically correct to use Boolean
functions minimization. Developing Minimization of Boolean functions algorithms
is started long time ago by Edward Veitch's 1952. Since it, big efforts by wide
scientific/industrial community was done to find feasible solution of Boolean
functions minimization. In this paper we propose consider table data
classification from mathematical point of view, as minimization of Boolean
functions. It is shown that data representation may be transformed to Boolean
functions form and how to use known algorithms. For simplicity, binary output
function is used for development, what opens doors for multivalued outputs
developments.

 <dc:description>  We study cheating strategies against a practical four-state quantum
bit-commitment protocol and its two-state variant when the underlying quantum
channels are noisy and the cheating party is constrained to using single-qubit
measurements only. We show that simply inferring the transmitted photons'
states by using the Breidbart basis, optimal for ambiguous (minimum-error)
state discrimination, does not directly produce an optimal cheating strategy
for this bit-commitment protocol. We introduce a new strategy, based on certain
post-measurement processes, and show it to have better chances at cheating than
the direct approach. We also study to what extent sending forged geographical
coordinates helps a dishonest party in breaking the binding security
requirement. Finally, we investigate the impact of imperfect single-photon
sources in the protocols. Our study shows that, in terms of the resources used,
the four-state protocol is advantageous over the two-state version. The
analysis performed can be straightforwardly generalised to any finite-qubit
measurement, with the same qualitative results.

 <dc:description>  Remote-memory-access models, also known as one-sided communication models,
are becoming an interesting alternative to traditional two-sided communication
models in the field of High Performance Computing. In this paper we extend
previous work on an MPI-based, locality-aware remote-memory-access model with a
asynchronous progress-engine for non-blocking communication operations. Most
previous related work suggests to drive progression on communication through an
additional thread within the application process. In contrast, our scheme uses
an arbitrary number of dedicated processes to drive asynchronous progression.
Further, we describe a prototypical library implementation of our concepts,
namely DART, which is used to quantitatively evaluate our design against a
MPI-3 baseline reference. The evaluation consists of micro-benchmark to measure
overlap of communication and computation and a scientific application kernel to
assess total performance impact on realistic use-cases. Our benchmarks shows,
that our asynchronous progression scheme can overlap computation and
communication efficiently and lead to substantially shorter communication cost
in real applications.

 <dc:description>  Small satellite systems enable whole new class of missions for navigation,
communications, remote sensing and scientific research for both civilian and
military purposes. As individual spacecraft are limited by the size, mass and
power constraints, mass-produced small satellites in large constellations or
clusters could be useful in many science missions such as gravity mapping,
tracking of forest fires, finding water resources, etc. Constellation of
satellites provide improved spatial and temporal resolution of the target.
Small satellite constellations contribute innovative applications by replacing
a single asset with several very capable spacecraft which opens the door to new
applications. With increasing levels of autonomy, there will be a need for
remote communication networks to enable communication between spacecraft. These
space based networks will need to configure and maintain dynamic routes, manage
intermediate nodes, and reconfigure themselves to achieve mission objectives.
Hence, inter-satellite communication is a key aspect when satellites fly in
formation. In this paper, we present the various researches being conducted in
the small satellite community for implementing inter-satellite communications
based on the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model. This paper also reviews
the various design parameters applicable to the first three layers of the OSI
model, i.e., physical, data link and network layer. Based on the survey, we
also present a comprehensive list of design parameters useful for achieving
inter-satellite communications for multiple small satellite missions. Specific
topics include proposed solutions for some of the challenges faced by small
satellite systems, enabling operations using a network of small satellites, and
some examples of small satellite missions involving formation flying aspects.

 <dc:title>Simple Algorithms for Scheduling Moldable Tasks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wu, Xiaohu</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Loiseau, Patrick</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Moldable tasks are a model of parallel processing that allows a choice of the
numbers of processors assigned to them, enabling efficient use of modern
parallel systems such as massively parallel processing systems and clusters. We
study the classical problem of scheduling a set T of n moldable tasks on m
processors. This problem has been extensively studied for the objective of
minimizing the makespan under the assumption of monotonic tasks, that is for
tasks whose workload increases when executed in parallel on multiple
processors; so far, the best result of interest is a
(3/2+\epsilon)-approximation algorithm with a complexity of
O(mnlog(n/\epsilon)). Motivated by recent observations in benchmark studies, we
consider the case where the speedup is linear for small parallelization.
Specifically, we introduce the following new assumption: the workload of a task
is constant when assigned no more than \delta processors (hence its execution
time decreases linearly); but when assigned $&gt;\delta$ processors the workload
increases and the execution time decreases non-linearly.
  In this paper, for an arbitrary value of \delta, we propose simple and
general procedures to separately optimize two scheduling objectives: (1)
minimizing the makespan, and (2) maximizing the sum of values of tasks
completed by a deadline. In particular, we propose a
1/\theta(\delta)*(1+\epsilon)-approximation algorithm with a complexity of
O(nlog(n/\epsilon)) for the first objective, and, a
\theta(\delta)-approximation algorithm with a complexity of O(n) for the second
objective. For example, \theta(5) and \theta(27) equals 3/4 and 7/8
approximately in the context of this paper. To the best of our knowledge, our
work is the first that considers the second objective for moldable tasks, while
it has been considered for other types of tasks.

 <dc:description>  Graph algorithms have wide applicablity to a variety of domains and are often
used on massive datasets. Recent standardization efforts such as the GraphBLAS
specify a set of key computational kernels that hardware and software
developers can adhere to. Graphulo is a processing framework that enables
GraphBLAS kernels in the Apache Accumulo database. In our previous work, we
have demonstrated a core Graphulo operation called \textit{TableMult} that
performs large-scale multiplication operations of database tables. In this
article, we present the results of scaling the Graphulo engine to larger
problems and scalablity when a greater number of resources is used.
Specifically, we present two experiments that demonstrate Graphulo scaling
performance is linear with the number of available resources. The first
experiment demonstrates cluster processing rates through Graphulo's TableMult
operator on two large graphs, scaled between $2^{17}$ and $2^{19}$ vertices.
The second experiment uses TableMult to extract a random set of rows from a
large graph ($2^{19}$ nodes) to simulate a cued graph analytic. These
benchmarking results are of relevance to Graphulo users who wish to apply
Graphulo to their graph problems.

$G$, the chromatic number of the square of $G$ satisfies $\chi(G^2) \le
(2-\varepsilon) \omega(G)^2$, where $\omega(G)$ is the clique number of $G$?
Erd\H{o}s and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il asked this question for the specific case of $G$
the line graph of a simple graph and this was answered in the affirmative by
Molloy and Reed. We show that the answer to the more general question is also

 <dc:description>  Uninterruptible power supply is the main motive of power utility companies
that motivate them for identifying and locating the different types of faults
as quickly as possible to protect the power system prevent complete power black
outs using intelligent techniques. Thus, the present research work presents a
novel method for detection of fault disturbances based on Wavelet Transform
(WT) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The voltage signal is taken
offline under fault conditions and is being processed through wavelet and ICA
for detection. The time-frequency resolution from WT transform detects the
fault initiation instant in the signal. Again, a performance index is
calculated from independent component analysis under fault condition which is
used to detect the fault disturbance in the voltage signal. The proposed
approach is tested to be robust enough under various operating scenarios like
without noise, with 20-dB noise and variation in frequency. Further, the
detection study is carried out using a performance index, energy content, by
applying the existing Fourier transform (FT), short time Fourier transform
(STFT) and the proposed wavelet transform. Fault disturbances are detected if
the energy calculated in each scenario is greater than the corresponding
threshold value. The fault detection study is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink for
a typical power system.

 <dc:description>  Conventional OFDM, adopted in LTE-A systems, cannot provide the quality of
service requirements sought in 5G systems because of extreme natural channel
impairments caused by higher Doppler spreads and unexpected artificial
impairments caused by multi-source transmission, to be brought by 5G, and by
synchronization relaxation for closed-loop signaling overhead reduction in some
5G applications. These severe impairments induce a strong loss of orthogonality
between subcarriers and OFDM symbols and, therefore, lead to a dramatic
increase in ICI and ISI. To be well armed against these dramatic impairments,
we, in the present paper, optimize the transmit/receive waveforms for FBMC
systems, with hexagonal time-frequency lattices, operating over severe doubly
dispersive channels, accounting for both natural and artificial impairments.
For this, we exploit the POPS paradigm, recently proposed for rectangular
time-frequency lattices, to design offline waveforms maximizing the SINR for
hexagonal time-frequency lattices. We show that FBMC, with hexagonal lattices,
offers a strong improvement in SIR with respect to conventional OFDM and an
improvement of 1dB with respect to POPS-FBMC, with classical rectangular
lattices. Furthermore, we show that the hexagonal POPS-FBMC brings more
robustness to frequency synchronization errors and offers a 10dB reduction in
OOB emissions with respect to rectangular POPS-FBMC.

 <dc:description>  The cost function used to train a generative model should fit the purpose of
the model. If the model is intended for tasks such as generating perceptually
correct samples, it is beneficial to maximise the likelihood of a sample drawn
from the model, Q, coming from the same distribution as the training data, P.
This is equivalent to minimising the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance, KL[Q||P].
However, if the model is intended for tasks such as retrieval or classification
it is beneficial to maximise the likelihood that a sample drawn from the
training data is captured by the model, equivalent to minimising KL[P||Q]. The
cost function used in adversarial training optimises the Jensen-Shannon entropy
which can be seen as an even interpolation between KL[Q||P] and KL[P||Q]. Here,
we propose an alternative adversarial cost function which allows easy tuning of
the model for either task. Our task specific cost function is evaluated on a
dataset of hand-written characters in the following tasks: Generation,
retrieval and one-shot learning.

 <dc:description>  Genomics are rapidly transforming medical practice and basic biomedical
research, providing insights into disease mechanisms and improving therapeutic
strategies, particularly in cancer. The ability to predict the future course of
a patient's disease from high-dimensional genomic profiling will be essential
in realizing the promise of genomic medicine, but presents significant
challenges for state-of-the-art survival analysis methods. In this abstract we
present an investigation in learning genomic representations with neural
networks to predict patient survival in cancer. We demonstrate the advantages
of this approach over existing survival analysis methods using brain tumor
data.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Coreference resolution systems are typically trained with heuristic loss
functions that require careful tuning. In this paper we instead apply
reinforcement learning to directly optimize a neural mention-ranking model for
coreference evaluation metrics. We experiment with two approaches: the
REINFORCE policy gradient algorithm and a reward-rescaled max-margin objective.
We find the latter to be more effective, resulting in significant improvements
over the current state-of-the-art on the English and Chinese portions of the
CoNLL 2012 Shared Task.

 <dc:description>  Transport based distances, such as the Wasserstein distance and earth mover's
distance, have been shown to be an effective tool in signal and image analysis.
The success of transport based distances is in part due to their Lagrangian
nature which allows it to capture the important variations in many signal
classes. However these distances require the signal to be nonnegative and
normalized. Furthermore, the signals are considered as measures and compared by
redistributing (transporting) them, which does not directly take into account
the signal intensity. Here we study a transport-based distance, called the
$TL^p$ distance, that combines Lagrangian and intensity modelling and is
directly applicable to general, non-positive and multi-channelled signals. The
framework allows the application of existing numerical methods. We give an
overview of the basic properties of this distance and applications to
classification, with multi-channelled, non-positive one and two-dimensional
signals, and color transfer.

 <dc:description>  Many recent advancements in Computer Vision are attributed to large datasets.
Open-source software packages for Machine Learning and inexpensive commodity
hardware have reduced the barrier of entry for exploring novel approaches at
scale. It is possible to train models over millions of examples within a few
days. Although large-scale datasets exist for image understanding, such as
ImageNet, there are no comparable size video classification datasets.
  In this paper, we introduce YouTube-8M, the largest multi-label video
classification dataset, composed of ~8 million videos (500K hours of video),
annotated with a vocabulary of 4800 visual entities. To get the videos and
their labels, we used a YouTube video annotation system, which labels videos
with their main topics. While the labels are machine-generated, they have
high-precision and are derived from a variety of human-based signals including
metadata and query click signals. We filtered the video labels (Knowledge Graph
entities) using both automated and manual curation strategies, including asking
human raters if the labels are visually recognizable. Then, we decoded each
video at one-frame-per-second, and used a Deep CNN pre-trained on ImageNet to
extract the hidden representation immediately prior to the classification
layer. Finally, we compressed the frame features and make both the features and
video-level labels available for download.
  We trained various (modest) classification models on the dataset, evaluated
them using popular evaluation metrics, and report them as baselines. Despite
the size of the dataset, some of our models train to convergence in less than a
day on a single machine using TensorFlow. We plan to release code for training
a TensorFlow model and for computing metrics.

 <dc:description>  Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) has been widely used for
recovering low-rank matrices in many data mining and machine learning problems.
It separates a data matrix into a low-rank part and a sparse part. The convex
approach has been well studied in the literature. However, state-of-the-art
algorithms for the convex approach usually have relatively high complexity due
to the need of solving (partial) singular value decompositions of large
matrices. A non-convex approach, AltProj, has also been proposed with lighter
complexity and better scalability. Given the true rank $r$ of the underlying
low rank matrix, AltProj has a complexity of $O(r^2dn)$, where $d\times n$ is
the size of data matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel factorization-based
model of RPCA, which has a complexity of $O(kdn)$, where $k$ is an upper bound
of the true rank. Our method does not need the precise value of the true rank.
From extensive experiments, we observe that AltProj can work only when $r$ is
precisely known in advance; however, when the needed rank parameter $r$ is
specified to a value different from the true rank, AltProj cannot fully
separate the two parts while our method succeeds. Even when both work, our
method is about 4 times faster than AltProj. Our method can be used as a
light-weight, scalable tool for RPCA in the absence of the precise value of the
true rank.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present quaternary and ternary routing tracks for FPGAs, and
their implementation in 28nm FDSOI technology. We discuss the transistor level
design of multi-valued repeaters, multiplexers and translators, and specific
features of FDSOI technology which make it possible. Next we compare the
multi-valued routing architectures with equivalent single driver two-valued
routing architectures. We show that for long tracks, it is possible to achieve
upto 3x reduction in dynamic switching energy, upto 2x reduction in routing
wire area and 10% reduction in area dedicated to routing resources. The
multi-valued tracks are slightly more susceptible to process variation. We
present a layout method for multivalued standard cells and determine the layout
overhead.We conclude with various usage scenarios of these tracks.

 <dc:description>  Interactions play a key role in understanding objects and scenes, for both
virtual and real world agents. We introduce a new general representation for
proximal interactions among physical objects that is agnostic to the type of
objects or interaction involved. The representation is based on tracking
particles on one of the participating objects and then observing them with
sensors appropriately placed in the interaction volume or on the interaction
surfaces. We show how to factorize these interaction descriptors and project
them into a particular participating object so as to obtain a new functional
descriptor for that object, its interaction landscape, capturing its observed
use in a spatio-temporal framework. Interaction landscapes are independent of
the particular interaction and capture subtle dynamic effects in how objects
move and behave when in functional use. Our method relates objects based on
their function, establishes correspondences between shapes based on functional
key points and regions, and retrieves peer and partner objects with respect to
an interaction.

 <dc:description>  Current large scale implementations of deep learning and data mining require
thousands of processors, massive amounts of off-chip memory, and consume
gigajoules of energy. Emerging memory technologies such as nanoscale
two-terminal resistive switching memory devices offer a compact, scalable and
low power alternative that permits on-chip co-located processing and memory in
fine-grain distributed parallel architecture. Here we report first use of
resistive switching memory devices for implementing and training a Restricted
Boltzmann Machine (RBM), a generative probabilistic graphical model as a key
component for unsupervised learning in deep networks. We experimentally
demonstrate a 45-synapse RBM realized with 90 resistive switching phase change
memory (PCM) elements trained with a bio-inspired variant of the Contrastive
Divergence (CD) algorithm, implementing Hebbian and anti-Hebbian weight
updates. The resistive PCM devices show a two-fold to ten-fold reduction in
error rate in a missing pixel pattern completion task trained over 30 epochs,
compared to untrained case. Measured programming energy consumption is 6.1 nJ
per epoch with the resistive switching PCM devices, a factor of ~150 times
lower than conventional processor-memory systems. We analyze and discuss the
dependence of learning performance on cycle-to-cycle variations as well as
number of gradual levels in the PCM analog memory devices.

 <dc:description>  Systems based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) have achieved
state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing tasks. Although
ANNs do not require manually engineered features, ANNs have many
hyperparameters to be optimized. The choice of hyperparameters significantly
impacts models' performances. However, the ANN hyperparameters are typically
chosen by manual, grid, or random search, which either requires expert
experiences or is computationally expensive. Recent approaches based on
Bayesian optimization using Gaussian processes (GPs) is a more systematic way
to automatically pinpoint optimal or near-optimal machine learning
hyperparameters. Using a previously published ANN model yielding
state-of-the-art results for dialog act classification, we demonstrate that
optimizing hyperparameters using GP further improves the results, and reduces
the computational time by a factor of 4 compared to a random search. Therefore
it is a useful technique for tuning ANN models to yield the best performances
for natural language processing tasks.

 <dc:description>  California is challenged by its worst drought in 600 years and faces future
water uncertainty. Pioneering new data infrastructure to integrate water use
data across California's more than a thousand water providers will support
water managers in ensuring water reliability. The California Data Collaborative
is a coalition of municipal water utilities serving ten percent of California's
population who are delivering on that promise by centralizing customer water
use data in a recently completed pilot project. This project overview describes
tools that have shown promising early results in improving water efficiency
programs and optimizing system operations. Longer term, these tools will help
navigate future uncertainty and support water managers in ensuring water
reliability no matter what the future holds. The uniquely publicly-owned data
infrastructure deployed in this project is envisioned to enable the world's
first &quot;marketplace of civic analytics&quot; to power the volume of water efficiency
measurements water managers require at a radically more cost effective price.
More broadly, this data-utility approach is adaptable to domains other than
water and shows specific potential for the broader universe of natural
resources.

 <dc:title>Access to Taxicabs for Unbanked Households: An Exploratory Analysis in
  New York City</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Saldarriaga, Juan Francisco</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Taxicabs are a critical aspect of the public transit system in New York City.
The yellow cabs that are ubiquitous in Manhattan are as iconic as the city's
subway system, and in recent years green taxicabs were introduced by the city
to improve taxi service in areas outside of the central business districts and
airports. Approximately 500,000 taxi trips are taken daily, carrying about
800,000 passengers, and not including other livery firms such as Uber, Lyft or
Carmel. Since 2008 yellow taxis have been able to process fare payments with
credit cards, and credits cards are a growing share of total fare payments.
However, the use of credit cards to pay for taxi fares varies widely across
neighborhoods, and there are strong correlations between cash payments for taxi
fares and the presence of unbanked or underbanked populations. These issues are
of concern for policymakers as approximately ten percent of households in the
city are unbanked, and in some neighborhoods the share of unbanked households
is over 50 percent. In this paper we use multiple datasets to explore taxicab
fare payments by neighborhood and examine how access to taxicab services is
associated with use of conventional banking services. There is a clear spatial
dimension to the propensity of riders to pay cash, and we find that both
immigrant status and being 'unbanked' are strong predictors of cash
transactions for taxicabs. These results have implications for local
regulations of the for-hire vehicle industry, particularly in the context of
the rapid growth of services that require credit cards. Without some type of
cash-based payment option taxi services will isolate certain neighborhoods. At
the very least, existing and new providers of transit services must consider
access to mainstream financial products as part of their equity analyses.

 <dc:description>  We study methods for finding the solution set of a generic system in a family
of polynomial systems with parametric coefficients. We present a framework for
describing monodromy based solvers in terms of decorated graphs. Under the
theoretical assumption that monodromy actions are generated uniformly, we show
that the expected number of homotopy paths tracked by an algorithm following
this framework is linear in the number of solutions. We demonstrate that our
software implementation is competitive with the existing state-of-the-art
methods implemented in other software packages.

 <dc:description>  The construction of cut trees (also known as Gomory-Hu trees) for a given
graph enables the minimum-cut size of the original graph to be obtained for any
pair of vertices. Cut trees are a powerful back-end for graph management and
mining, as they support various procedures related to the minimum cut, maximum
flow, and connectivity. However, the crucial drawback with cut trees is the
computational cost of their construction. In theory, a cut tree is built by
applying a maximum flow algorithm for $n$ times, where $n$ is the number of
vertices. Therefore, naive implementations of this approach result in cubic
time complexity, which is obviously too slow for today's large-scale graphs. To
address this issue, in the present study, we propose a new cut-tree
construction algorithm tailored to real-world networks. Using a series of
experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is several orders of
magnitude faster than previous algorithms and it can construct cut trees for
billion-scale graphs.

 <dc:description>  While traditional multimedia applications such as games and videos are still
popular, there has been a significant interest in the recent years towards new
3D media such as 3D immersion and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, especially
360 VR videos. 360 VR video is an immersive spherical video where the user can
look around during playback. Unfortunately, 360 VR videos are extremely
bandwidth intensive, and therefore are difficult to stream at acceptable
quality levels. In this paper, we propose an adaptive bandwidth-efficient 360
VR video streaming system using a divide and conquer approach. In our approach,
we propose a dynamic view-aware adaptation technique to tackle the huge
streaming bandwidth demands of 360 VR videos. We spatially divide the videos
into multiple tiles while encoding and packaging, use MPEG-DASH SRD to describe
the spatial relationship of tiles in the 360-degree space, and prioritize the
tiles in the Field of View (FoV). In order to describe such tiled
representations, we extend MPEG-DASH SRD to the 3D space of 360 VR videos. We
spatially partition the underlying 3D mesh, and construct an efficient 3D
geometry mesh called hexaface sphere to optimally represent a tiled 360 VR
video in the 3D space. Our initial evaluation results report up to 72%
bandwidth savings on 360 VR video streaming with minor negative quality impacts
compared to the baseline scenario when no adaptations is applied.

 <dc:description>  Change-impact analysis (CIA) is the task of determining the set of program
elements impacted by a program change. Precise CIA has great potential to avoid
expensive testing and code reviews for (parts of) changes that are refactorings
(semantics-preserving). Existing CIA is imprecise because it is coarse-grained,
deals with only few refactoring patterns, or is unaware of the change
semantics.
  We formalize the notion of change impact in terms of the trace semantics of
two program versions. We show how to leverage equivalence relations to make
dataflow-based CIA aware of the change semantics, thereby improving precision
in the presence of semantics-preserving changes. We propose an anytime
algorithm that allows applying costly equivalence relation inference
incrementally to refine the set of impacted statements. We have implemented a
prototype in SymDiff, and evaluated it on 322 real-world changes from
open-source projects and benchmark programs used by prior research. The
evaluation results show an average 35% improvement in the size of the set of
impacted statements compared to standard dataflow-based techniques.

 <dc:description>  In the Sparse Linear Regression (SLR) problem, given a $d \times n$ matrix
$M$ and a $d$-dimensional vector $q$, we want to compute a $k$-sparse vector
$\tau$ such that the error $||M \tau-q||$ is minimized. In this paper, we
present algorithms and conditional lower bounds for several variants of this
problem. In particular, we consider (i) the Affine SLR where we add the
constraint that $\sum_i \tau_i=1$ and (ii) the Convex SLR where we further add
the constraint that $\tau \geq 0$. Furthermore, we consider (i) the batched
(offline) setting, where the matrix $M$ and the vector $q$ are given as inputs
in advance, and (ii) the query(online) setting, where an algorithm preprocesses
the matrix $M$ to quickly answer such queries. All of the aforementioned
variants have been well-studied and have many applications in statistics,
machine learning and sparse recovery.
  We consider the approximate variants of these problems in the &quot;low sparsity
regime&quot; where the value of the sparsity bound $k$ is low. In particular, we
show that the online variant of all three problems can be solved with query
time $\tilde O(n^{k-1})$. This provides non-trivial improvements over the naive
algorithm that exhaustively searches all ${ n \choose k}$ subsets $B$. We also
show that solving the offline variant of all three problems, would require an
exponential dependence of the form $\tilde \Omega(n^{k/2}/e^{k})$, under a
natural complexity-theoretic conjecture. Improving this lower bound for the
case of $k=4$ would imply a nontrivial lower bound for the famous Hopcroft's
problem. Moreover, solving the offline variant of affine SLR in $o(n^{k-1})$
would imply an upper bound of $o(n^d)$ for the problem of testing whether a
given set of $n$ points in a $d$-dimensional space is degenerate. However, this
is conjectured to require $\Omega(n^d)$ time.

 <dc:description>  Hashing method maps similar data to binary hashcodes with smaller hamming
distance, and it has received a broad attention due to its low storage cost and
fast retrieval speed. However, the existing limitations make the present
algorithms difficult to deal with large-scale datasets: (1) discrete
constraints are involved in the learning of the hash function; (2) pairwise or
triplet similarity is adopted to generate efficient hashcodes, resulting both
time and space complexity are greater than O(n^2). To address these issues, we
propose a novel discrete supervised hash learning framework which can be
scalable to large-scale datasets. First, the discrete learning procedure is
decomposed into a binary classifier learning scheme and binary codes learning
scheme, which makes the learning procedure more efficient. Second, we adopt the
Asymmetric Low-rank Matrix Factorization and propose the Fast Clustering-based
Batch Coordinate Descent method, such that the time and space complexity is
reduced to O(n). The proposed framework also provides a flexible paradigm to
incorporate with arbitrary hash function, including deep neural networks and
kernel methods. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method is superior or comparable with state-of-the-art hashing
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The recent trend for acquiring big data assumes that possessing
quantitatively more and qualitatively finer data necessarily provides an
advantage that may be critical in competitive situations. Using a model complex
adaptive system where agents compete for a limited resource using information
coarse-grained to different levels, we show that agents having access to more
and better data can perform worse than others in certain situations. The
relation between information asymmetry and individual payoffs is seen to be
complex, depending on the composition of the population of competing agents.

identify mobility patterns of people in near real time, enabling to build
epidemiological models for understanding where epidemics might spread over
time. Based on previous research, we have built an operational tool fed with
telecom data which shows malaria risk flows in Zambia in near real time. It
provides insights on which areas should eradicate malaria first in order to
have a maximum impact on the overall country malaria flows, and it highlights
regions that should coordinate their eradication efforts together. Such
information is particularly relevant for countries like Zambia, which are
getting close to malaria elimination and need to prevent its re-introduction
into areas that are already malaria-free.

 <dc:description>  Finding reliable data to inform decisions about technology for global
development remains a challenge. Easily accessible &quot;Knowledge platforms&quot; are a
way to curate and standardize information about technology for development.
Three collaborators, Engineering for Change, the Global Alliance for Clean
Cookstoves and the Center for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology
(CAWST) are working together to create platforms to serve the global
development sector. Such platforms could be the first step in making decisions
about how to solve a problem that needs a technology-based solution. They could
motivate manufacturers to demonstrate compliance with quality standards, and
they could encourage independent research into each product's impact. Years of
development experience worldwide have yielded a set of best practices to
increase the life of a project. These platforms clarify those practices to
improve quality and reduce waste. As the platforms mature, mining them for data
could identify trends that influence the entire technology ecosystem. Those
could include decisions about performance targets, future innovation, pricing,
compliance with regulations, and funding priorities.

 <dc:description>  Bloomberg Philanthropies launched What Works Cities (WWC) in 2015 to help
cities better leverage data and evidence to drive decision-making and improve
residents' lives. Over three years, WWC will work with 100 American cities with
populations between 100,000 and 1,000,000 to measure their state of practice
and provide targeted technical assistance. This paper uses the data obtained
through the WWC discovery process to understand how 67 cities are currently
using data to deliver city services. Our analysis confirms that while cities
possess a strong desire to use data and evidence, government leaders are
constrained in their ability to apply these practices. We find that a city's
stated commitment to using data is the strongest predictor of overall
performance and that strong practice in almost any one specific technical area
of using data to inform decisions is an indicator of strong practices in other
areas. The exception is open data; we find larger cities are more adept at
adopting open data policies and programs, independent of their performance
using data overall. This paper seeks to develop a deeper understanding of the
issues underlying these findings and to continue the conversation on how to
best support cities' efforts in this work.

 <dc:description>  The link between data and governance are key to making public health supply
chains more integrated and responsive in order to get life-saving commodities
to those in need. In particular, considering its significant health challenges,
poor maternal and child health indicators, and major recent devolution in
political authority, Kenya represents a country in need of an innovative revamp
of their data management and governance. John Snow, Inc. (JSI) adapted various
elements of proven interventions to build a customized structure to support
routine data collection in order to drive decision making around supply chain
improvement.

 <dc:description>  Across all major industrial fishing sectors, overfishing due to overcapacity
and lack of compliance in fishery governance has led to a decline in biomass of
many global fish stocks. Overfishing threatens ocean biodiversity, global food
security, and the livelihoods of law abiding fishermen. To address this issue,
Global Fishing Watch (GFW) was created to bring transparency to global
fisheries using computer science and big data analytics. A product of a
partnership between Oceana, SkyTruth and Google, GFW uses the Automatic
Identification System, or AIS, to analyze the movement of vessels at sea. AIS
provides vessel location data, and GFW uses this information to track global
vessel movement and apply algorithms to classify vessel behavior as &quot;fishing&quot;
or &quot;non-fishing&quot; activity. Now publicly available, anyone with an internet
connection can monitor when and where trackable commercial fishing appears to
be occurring around the world. Hundreds of millions of people around the world
depend on our ocean for their livelihoods, and many more rely on it for food.
Collectively, the various applications of GFW will help reduce overfishing and
illegal fishing, restore the ocean's abundance, and ensure sustainability
through better monitoring and governance of our marine resources.

 <dc:title>A Functioning Beta Solution to the Challenge of Opening Transit Payment
  System Transaction Data</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The deployment of smart-card-based public transit fare payment systems
provides government the opportunity to create a valuable derivative data
product. Companies such as Urban Engines have demonstrated an ability to add
value to the data derived from transit fare transactions. The challenge for the
public sector is to, for the societal good, leverage private sector interest by
giving access to useful fare transaction data in a manner that protects
customer privacy. This challenge is particularly acute in California, where
privacy laws make sharing data in a manner that supports the public interest
difficult. This paper presents the Metropolitan Transportation Commission's
(MTC's) proposed solution to the problem. MTC operates the Clipper(r) transit
fare payment system for the San Francisco Bay Area. In an effort to share
usable data that protects customer privacy, MTC developed an anonymizing scheme
that is the subject of the present paper. We seek feedback on our approach from
the Data for Good Exchange community, asking: in seeking a balance between
customer privacy and usability, does the scheme go too far in either direction?
And, should we take a different anonymizing approach?

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a video summarization technique for an Internet video to
provide a quick way to overview its content. This is a challenging problem
because finding important or informative parts of the original video requires
to understand its content. Furthermore the content of Internet videos is very
diverse, ranging from home videos to documentaries, which makes video
summarization much more tough as prior knowledge is almost not available. To
tackle this problem, we propose to use deep video features that can encode
various levels of content semantics, including objects, actions, and scenes,
improving the efficiency of standard video summarization techniques. For this,
we design a deep neural network that maps videos as well as descriptions to a
common semantic space and jointly trained it with associated pairs of videos
and descriptions. To generate a video summary, we extract the deep features
from each segment of the original video and apply a clustering-based
summarization technique to them. We evaluate our video summaries using the
SumMe dataset as well as baseline approaches. The results demonstrated the
advantages of incorporating our deep semantic features in a video summarization
technique.

 <dc:title>Public Intervention Strategies for Distressed Communities</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>King, Lester O.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This research presents a methodology to comprehensively define Distressed
Communities. We further identify if there is a significant difference in public
investment between Distressed communities and Wealthy communities. One of the
key tools in sustainability planning is the use of sustainability indicators
(Sis). A considerable amount of scholarship has contributed to define and
develop SI programs for local level application (Elgert and Krueger, 2012).
Much of the focus of SI research is on developing the ideal indicator based on
defined criteria for each indicator (Hart, 1999; Innes and Booher 2000; Holman,
2009). Here we suggest a methodology beyond defining the ideal indicators to
demonstrating how indicators can be used for more in-depth analysis of complex
urban problems. In this analysis we reduce 34 development metrics to a smaller
number of factors that represent how the data can be classified into groups
based on similarities among 88 communities. Using the factor (group) that
contained measures identifying Distressed Communities, the communities were
alloted an index score and ranked. The top 10 communities were then compared to
the bottom 10 communities according to 14 place based variables related to
opportunities for local government led improvement.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we investigate the benefit of augmenting data with
synthetically created samples when training a machine learning classifier. Two
approaches for creating additional training samples are data warping, which
generates additional samples through transformations applied in the data-space,
and synthetic over-sampling, which creates additional samples in feature-space.
We experimentally evaluate the benefits of data augmentation for a
convolutional backpropagation-trained neural network, a convolutional support
vector machine and a convolutional extreme learning machine classifier, using
the standard MNIST handwritten digit dataset. We found that while it is
possible to perform generic augmentation in feature-space, if plausible
transforms for the data are known then augmentation in data-space provides a
greater benefit for improving performance and reducing overfitting.

 <dc:title>iRescU - Data for Social Good Saving Lives Bridging the Gaps in Sudden
  Cardiac Arrest Survival</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Levick, Nadine</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Currently every day in the USA 1000 people die of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)
outside of hospitals or ambulances - before emergency medical help arrives - in
the streets, workplaces, schools and homes of our cities, adults and children.
Brain death commences in 3 minutes, and often the ambulance just can't be there
in time. Citizen cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and automated external
defibrillator (AED) use can save precious minutes and lives. Using public
access AED's saves lives in SCA- however AEDs are used in &lt;2% of cardiac
arrests, though could save lives in 80% if available, findable, functioning,
and used. The systems problem to solve is that there is no comprehensive or
real time accessible database of the AED locations, and also it is not known
that they are actually being positioned where they are needed. The iRescU
project is designed to bridge this gap in SCA survival, by substantially
augmenting the AED database. Utilizing a combination of AED crowd sourcing and
geolocation integrated with existing 911 services and SCA events and projected
events based on machine learning data information to help make the nearest AED
accessible and available in the setting of a SCA emergency and to identify the
areas of greatest need for AEDs to be positioned in the community. Helping to
save lives and address preventable death with a social good approach and
applied big data.

 <dc:title>Data Accessibility as a Pathway to Genuine Equality for Atlanta's
  Westside Communities</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Data is a dominant force during the decision-making process. It can help
determine which roads to expand and the optimal location for a grocery store.
Data can also be used to influence which schools to open or to shutter and
&quot;appropriate&quot; city services to continue or discontinue. Considered fact-based,
objective, and impartial, data can trump emotional appeals during the final
evaluation of a project; thus creating a power imbalance between those with the
resources to access data and those without. Most often left behind are
communities already struggling to stay afloat due to years of disinvestment by
market forces and external decision-makers. For long ignored residents in
Atlanta's Westside neighborhoods, the burden of inaccessible data continuously
thwarts their opportunity for mobility. However, with the advent of the
internet and the global push for open data, access to information is no longer
solely in the hands of those with power, influence and money. Online tools,
like the Westside Communities Alliance (WCA) Data Dashboard, quickly
disseminate data to those most impacted by &quot;data driven decision-making,&quot; thus
creating the potential of a genuinely equitable society.
  Based out of the Georgia Institute of Technology, the WCA works to build and
sustain relationships among constituencies located in West Atlanta with the
goal to strengthen partnerships around issues of common concern. The creation
of the Data Dashboard stemmed from a recognized community desire for more
localized control and the need for improvements to the communities' overall
prosperity. Development of the site progressed through significant engagement
between the WCA, community groups, and local agencies. The Dashboard takes the
vast abundance of data and synthesizes it into a format that is both visually
and geographically user-friendly. Through different portals, users can access
neighborhood-level data around demographics, housing, education, and history
that is formatting in a way that is easily accessible and understandable. The
site includes qualitative research that goes beyond data and stats to give a
totality of the community. By allowing West Atlanta advocacy groups to easily
retrieve data, the WCA Data Dashboard empowers residents, nonprofits, and
neighborhood associations to be full participants in the decision-making
process.

 <dc:title>The Subset Assignment Problem for Data Placement in Caches</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ghandeharizadeh, Shahram</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Irani, Sandy</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lam, Jenny</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce the subset assignment problem in which items of varying sizes
are placed in a set of bins with limited capacity. Items can be replicated and
placed in any subset of the bins. Each (item, subset) pair has an associated
cost. Not assigning an item to any of the bins is not free in general and can
potentially be the most expensive option. The goal is to minimize the total
cost of assigning items to subsets without exceeding the bin capacities. This
problem is motivated by the design of caching systems composed of banks of
memory with varying cost/performance specifications. The ability to replicate a
data item in more than one memory bank can benefit the overall performance of
the system with a faster recovery time in the event of a memory failure. For
this setting, the number $n$ of data objects (items) is very large and the
number $d$ of memory banks (bins) is a small constant (on the order of $3$ or
$4$). Therefore, the goal is to determine an optimal assignment in time that
minimizes dependence on $n$. The integral version of this problem is NP-hard
since it is a generalization of the knapsack problem. We focus on an efficient
solution to the LP relaxation as the number of fractionally assigned items will
be at most $d$. If the data objects are small with respect to the size of the
memory banks, the effect of excluding the fractionally assigned data items from
the cache will be small. We give an algorithm that solves the LP relaxation and
runs in time $O({3^d \choose d+1} \text{poly}(d) n \log(n) \log(nC) \log(Z))$,
where $Z$ is the maximum item size and $C$ the maximum storage cost.

 <dc:title>Ignoring Extreme Opinions in Complex Networks: The Impact of

 <dc:description>  We consider a class of opinion dynamics on networks where at each time-step,
each node in the network disregards the opinions of a certain number of its
most extreme neighbors and updates its own opinion as a weighted average of the
remaining opinions. When all nodes disregard the same number of extreme
neighbors, previous work has shown that consensus will be reached if and only
if the network satisfies certain topological properties. In this paper, we
consider the implications of allowing each node to have a personal threshold
for the number of extreme neighbors to ignore. We provide graph conditions
under which consensus is guaranteed for such dynamics. We then study random
networks where each node's threshold is drawn from a certain distribution, and
provide conditions on that distribution, together with conditions on the edge
formation probability, that guarantee that consensus will be reached
asymptotically almost surely.

 <dc:title>Education Stats Made Visible: Helping School District Managers Write
  Better Three-Year Plans</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Problem: School district leaders in California are awash in a sea of data,
but are often unable to find it, query it, or relate it with other data.
Districts are islands, leaving district managers able to see only their own
data. A state education agency gathers and republishes districts' data, but
doesn't clean it. New laws now require them to plan in public, set goals,
assign resources, and project benefits for specific groups of kids. The
evidence base they need remains out of reach.
  Solution: Our team was commissioned by two county offices of education to
design a comparative methodology and data visualization environment to help
district managers write these three-year plans. Ten year of data spanning
finance, staffing, students, discipline, course offerings and assessments were
acquired, QA'd and integrated. A Tableau development team built 50+ pages of
leaderboards and scatterplots. A documentation team wrote training materials.
Each district in this county received a custom workbook which framed its
district's vital signs within a context of 15 districts whose students were
most like their own. This presentation shares the work and our evaluation.

emotions or &quot;feeling states&quot; in migration and settlement processes, and it is
often approached through closed-ended survey questions that superficially
assess feeling states. The evaluation of emotions in migration and settlement
has been largely left to qualitative researchers using in-depth, interpretive
methods like semi-structured interviewing. This approach also has major
limitations, namely small sample sizes that capture limited geographic
contexts, heavy time burdens analyzing data, and limits to analytic consistency
given the nuances of qualitative data coding. Information about migrant emotion
states, however, would be valuable to governments and NGOs to enable policy and
program development tailored to migrant challenges and frustrations, and would
thereby stimulate economic development through thriving migrant populations. In
this paper, we present an interdisciplinary pilot project that offers a way
through the methodological impasse by subjecting exhaustive qualitative
interviews of migrants to sentiment analysis using the Python NLTK toolkit. We
propose that data scientists can efficiently and accurately produce large-scale
assessments of migrant feeling states through collaboration with social
scientists.

from the sequence of characters in the color's name. Using large scale
color--name pairs obtained from an online color design forum, we evaluate our

 <dc:description>  A glaring reality of American industrialized society is that people spend a
tremendous amount of their waking life in their workplace and other interior
environments. Despite the amount of time that we spend in them, many of our
constructed environments that we inhabit are not designed for the people and
communities that rely on them. From a health and wellness perspective, there is
a growing body of research on the ways that our interior environments and lack
of exposure to natural elements systematically impacts our health and strains
our healthcare system. In short, the spaces in which we live and work are a
major public health issue and should be considered in this way. In this paper,
we lay out a vision for using the underleveraged social data-available through
social media-to inform the architecture, developer and real estate industries.
The goal is ultimately a public health initiative: to create spaces that are
healthier, more responsive, equitable and human-centric through social
data-supported design.

 <dc:description>  The U.S. has the highest rate of firearm-related deaths when compared to
other industrialized countries. Violence particularly affects low-income, urban
neighborhoods in cities like Chicago, which saw a 40% increase in firearm
violence from 2014 to 2015 to more than 3,000 shooting victims. While recent
studies have found that urban, gang-involved individuals curate a unique and
complex communication style within and between social media platforms,
organizations focused on reducing gang violence are struggling to keep up with
the growing complexity of social media platforms and the sheer volume of data
they present. In this paper, describe the Digital Urban Violence Analysis
Approach (DUVVA), a collaborative qualitative analysis method used in a
collaboration between data scientists and social work researchers to develop a
suite of systems for decoding the high- stress language of urban, gang-involved
youth. Our approach leverages principles of grounded theory when analyzing
approximately 800 tweets posted by Chicago gang members and participation of
youth from Chicago neighborhoods to create a language resource for natural
language processing (NLP) methods. In uncovering the unique language and
communication style, we developed automated tools with the potential to detect
aggressive language on social media and aid individuals and groups in
performing violence prevention and interruption.

 <dc:description>  The Quantified Community (QC)--a long-term neighborhood informatics research
initiative--is a network of instrumented urban neighborhoods that collect,
measure, and analyze data on physical and environmental conditions and human
behavior to better understand how neighborhoods and the built environment
affect individual and social well-being. This initiative is intended to create
a data-enabled research environment to rigorously study the complex
interactions in urban neighborhoods. The QC has initially launched in three
very distinct areas in New York City: at Hudson Yards, a ground-up
&quot;city-within-a-city&quot; of approximately 20 million square feet in Manhattan, in
collaboration with the Related Companies; in Lower Manhattan, a mixed-use
neighborhood that attracts residents, workers, and visitors, in collaboration
with the Alliance for Downtown NY; and in Red Hook, Brooklyn, an
economically-distressed community facing significant development and
demographic changes, in partnership with the Red Hook Initiative. This paper
describes our recent pilot project to deploy novel urban sensors in Red Hook to
collect and analyze quality-of-life measurements at high spatial and temporal
resolution. This effort is complemented by a citizen science initiative to
engage local residents in the data collection and problem-solving process to
drive evidenced-based community decision-making and improve local and city
governance.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel location-aware pilot assignment scheme to mitigate pilot
contamination in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks, where
the channels are subjected to Rician fading. Our proposed scheme utilizes the
location information of users as the input to conduct pilot assignment in the
network. Based on the location information, we first determine the line of
sight (LOS) interference between the intended signal and the interfering
signal. Our analysis reveals that the LOS interference converges to zero as the
number of antennas at the base station (BS) goes to infinity, whereas for
finite number of antennas at the BS the LOS interference indeed depends on
specific pilot allocation strategies. Following this revelation, we assign
pilot sequences to all the users in the massive MIMO network such that the LOS
interference is minimized for finite number of antennas at the BS. Our proposed
scheme outperforms the random pilot assignment in terms of achieving a much
higher uplink sum rate for reasonable values of the Rician K-factor. Moreover,
we propose a new performance metric, which measures the strength of the LOS
interference and demonstrate that it is a good metric to analyze the
performance of pilot assignment schemes. Theoretical analysis is provided and
verified through numerical simulations to support the proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown clear superiority in sequence
modeling, particularly the ones with gated units, such as long short-term
memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). However, the dynamic properties
behind the remarkable performance remain unclear in many applications, e.g.,
automatic speech recognition (ASR). This paper employs visualization techniques
to study the behavior of LSTM and GRU when performing speech recognition tasks.
Our experiments show some interesting patterns in the gated memory, and some of
them have inspired simple yet effective modifications on the network structure.
We report two of such modifications: (1) lazy cell update in LSTM, and (2)
shortcut connections for residual learning. Both modifications lead to more
comprehensible and powerful networks.

 <dc:title>On Notions of Distortion and an Almost Minimum Spanning Tree with

 <dc:description>  Minimum Spanning Trees of weighted graphs are fundamental objects in numerous
applications. In particular in distributed networks, the minimum spanning tree
of the network is often used to route messages between network nodes.
Unfortunately, while being most efficient in the total cost of connecting all
nodes, minimum spanning trees fail miserably in the desired property of
approximately preserving distances between pairs. While known lower bounds
exclude the possibility of the worst case distortion of a tree being small, it
was shown in [ABN15] that there exists a spanning tree with constant average
distortion. Yet, the weight of such a tree may be significantly larger than
that of the MST. In this paper, we show that any weighted undirected graph
admits a spanning tree whose weight is at most (1+\rho) times that of the MST,
providing constant average distortion O(1/\rho).
  The constant average distortion bound is implied by a stronger property of
scaling distortion, i.e., improved distortion for smaller fractions of the
pairs. The result is achieved by first showing the existence of a low weight
spanner with small prioritized distortion, a property allowing to prioritize
the nodes whose associated distortions will be improved. We show that
prioritized distortion is essentially equivalent to coarse scaling distortion
via a general transformation, which has further implications and may be of
independent interest. In particular, we obtain an embedding for arbitrary
metrics into Euclidean space with optimal prioritized distortion.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We address the problem of integrating textual and visual information in
vector space models for word meaning representation. We first present the
Residual CCA (R-CCA) method, that complements the standard CCA method by
representing, for each modality, the difference between the original signal and
the signal projected to the shared, max correlation, space. We then show that
constructing visual and textual representations and then post-processing them
through composition of common modeling motifs such as PCA, CCA, R-CCA and
linear interpolation (a.k.a sequential modeling) yields high quality models. On
five standard semantic benchmarks our sequential models outperform recent
multimodal representation learning alternatives, including ones that rely on
joint representation learning. For two of these benchmarks our R-CCA method is
part of the Best configuration our algorithm yields.

 <dc:description>  Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) will unlock their true potential once they can
operate in groups. To this end, it is essential for them to estimate on-board
the relative location of their neighbors. The challenge lies in limiting the
mass and processing burden needed to enable this. We developed a relative
localization method that only requires the MAVs to communicate via their
wireless transceiver. Communication allows the exchange of on-board states
(velocity, height, and orientation), while the signal-strength provides range
data. These quantities are fused to provide a full relative location estimate.
We used our method to tackle the problem of collision avoidance in tight areas.
The system was tested with a team of AR.Drones flying in a 4mx4m area and with
miniature drones of ~50g in a 2mx2m area. The MAVs were able to track their
relative positions and fly several minutes without collisions. Our
implementation used Bluetooth to communicate between the drones. This featured
significant noise and disturbances in signal-strength, which worsened as more
drones were added. Simulation analysis suggests that results can improve with a
more suitable transceiver module.

 <dc:title>Reduced-Complexity SCL Decoding of Multi-CRC-Aided Polar Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chiu, Mao-Ching</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) aided polar codes are capable of achieving
better performance than low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes under the
successive cancelation list (SCL) decoding scheme. However, the SCL decoding
scheme suffers from very high space and time complexities. Especially, the high
space complexity is a major concern for adopting polar codes in modern mobile
communication standards. In this paper, we propose a novel reduced-complexity
successive cancelation list (R-SCL) decoding scheme which is effective to
reduce the space complexity. Simulation results show that, with a (2048, 1024)
CRC-aided polar code, the R-SCL decoders with 25% reduction of space complexity
and 8% reduction of time complexity can still achieve almost the same
performance levels as those decoded by SCL decoders. To further reduce the
complexity, we propose a multi-CRC coding scheme for polar codes. Simulation
results show that, with a (16384, 8192) multi-CRC-aided polar code, a R-SCL
decoder with about 85% reduction of space complexity and 20% reduction of time
complexity results in a worst performance loss of only 0.04dB.

 <dc:description>  The graph translation operator has been defined with good spectral properties
in mind, and in particular with the end goal of being an isometric operator.
Unfortunately, the resulting definitions do not provide good intuitions on a
vertex-domain interpretation. In this paper, we show that this operator does
have a vertex-domain interpretation as a diffusion operator using a polynomial
approximation. We show that its impulse response exhibit an exponential decay
of the energy way from the impulse, demonstrating localization preservation.
Additionally, we formalize several techniques that can be used to study other
graph signal operators.

 <dc:description>  Identifying mathematical relations expressed in text is essential to
understanding a broad range of natural language text from election reports, to
financial news, to sport commentaries to mathematical word problems. This paper
focuses on identifying and understanding mathematical relations described
within a single sentence. We introduce the problem of Equation Parsing -- given
a sentence, identify noun phrases which represent variables, and generate the
mathematical equation expressing the relation described in the sentence. We
introduce the notion of projective equation parsing and provide an efficient
algorithm to parse text to projective equations. Our system makes use of a high
precision lexicon of mathematical expressions and a pipeline of structured
predictors, and generates correct equations in $70\%$ of the cases. In $60\%$
of the time, it also identifies the correct noun phrase $\rightarrow$ variables
mapping, significantly outperforming baselines. We also release a new annotated
dataset for task evaluation.

 <dc:description>  The discovery of patterns that accurately discriminate one class label from
another remains a challenging data mining task. Subgroup discovery (SD) is one
of the frameworks that enables to elicit such interesting hypotheses from
labeled data. A question remains fairly open: How to select an accurate
heuristic search technique when exhaustive enumeration of the pattern space is
infeasible? Existing approaches make use of beam-search, sampling and genetic
algorithms for discovering a pattern set that is non-redundant and of high
quality w.r.t. a pattern quality measure. We argue that such approaches produce
pattern sets that lack of diversity: Only few patterns of high quality, and
different enough, are discovered. Our main contribution is then to formally
define pattern mining as a game and to solve it with Monte Carlo tree search
(MCTS). It can be seen as an exhaustive search guided by random simulations
which can be stopped early (limited budget) by virtue of its best-first search
property. We show through a comprehensive set of experiments how MCTS enables
the anytime discovery of a diverse pattern set of high quality. It outperforms
other approaches when dealing with a large pattern search space and for
different quality measures. Thanks to its genericity, our MCTS settings can be
used for SD but also for many other pattern mining tasks.

 <dc:description>  Recently, end-to-end memory networks have shown promising results on Question
Answering task, which encode the past facts into an explicit memory and perform
reasoning ability by making multiple computational steps on the memory.
However, memory networks conduct the reasoning on sentence-level memory to
output coarse semantic vectors and do not further take any attention mechanism
to focus on words, which may lead to the model lose some detail information,
especially when the answers are rare or unknown words. In this paper, we
propose a novel Hierarchical Memory Networks, dubbed HMN. First, we encode the
past facts into sentence-level memory and word-level memory respectively. Then,
(k)-max pooling is exploited following reasoning module on the sentence-level
memory to sample the (k) most relevant sentences to a question and feed these
sentences into attention mechanism on the word-level memory to focus the words
in the selected sentences. Finally, the prediction is jointly learned over the
outputs of the sentence-level reasoning module and the word-level attention
mechanism. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully
conducts answer selection on unknown words and achieves a better performance
than memory networks.

 <dc:title>On Shared Rate Time Series for Mobile Users in Poisson Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on modeling and analysis of the temporal performance
variations experienced by a mobile user in a wireless network and its impact on
system level design. We consider a simple stochastic geometry model: the
infrastructure nodes are Poisson distributed while the user's motion is the
simplest possible i.e., constant velocity on a straight line. We first
characterize variations in the SNR process, and associated downlink Shannon
rate, resulting from variations in the infrastructure geometry seen by the
mobile. Specifically, by making a connection between stochastic geometry and
queueing theory the level crossings of the SNR process are shown to form an
alternating renewal process whose distribution can be completely characterized.
For large or small SNR levels, and associated rare events, we further derive
simple distributional (exponential) models. We then characterize the second
major contributor to variation, associated with changes in the number of other
users sharing infrastructure. Combining these two effects, we study what are
the dominant factors (infrastructure geometry or sharing number) given mobile
experiences a very high or low shared rate. These results are then used to
evaluate and optimize the system-level Quality of Service (QoS) and
system-level capacity to support mobile users sharing wireless infrastructure,
including mobile devices streaming video which proactively buffer content to
prevent rebuffering and mobiles which are downloading large files. Finally, we
use simulation to assess the fidelity of this model and its robustness to
factors which are presently taken into account.

 <dc:description>  The direct kinematics analysis is the foundation of implementation of real
world application of parallel manipulators. For most parallel manipulators the
direct kinematics is challenging. In this paper, for the first time a fast and
efficient Homotopy Continuation Method, called the Ostrowski Homotopy
continuation method has been implemented to solve the direct and inverse
kinematics problem of the parallel manipulators. This method has advantage over
conventional numerical iteration methods, which is not rely on the initial
values and is more efficient than other continuation method and it can find all
solutions of equations without divergence just by changing auxiliary Homotopy
function. Numerical example and simulation was done to solve the direct
kinematic problem of the 3-UPU parallel manipulator that leads to 16 real
solutions. Results obviously reveal the fastness and effectiveness of this
method than the conventional Homotopy continuation methods such as Newton
Homotopy. The results shows that the Ostrowski-Homotopy reduces computation
time up to 80-97 % with more accuracy in solutions in comparison with the
Newton Homotopy.

 <dc:title>Towards the effectiveness of Deep Convolutional Neural Network based
  Fast Random Forest Classifier</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Deep Learning is considered to be a quite young in the area of machine
learning research, found its effectiveness in dealing complex yet high
dimensional dataset that includes but limited to images, text and speech etc.
with multiple levels of representation and abstraction. As there are a plethora
of research on these datasets by various researchers , a win over them needs
lots of attention. Careful setting of Deep learning parameters is of paramount
importance in order to avoid the overfitting unlike conventional methods with
limited parameter settings. Deep Convolutional neural network (DCNN) with
multiple layers of compositions and appropriate settings might be is an
efficient machine learning method that can outperform the conventional methods
in a great way. However, due to its slow adoption in learning, there are also
always a chance of overfitting during feature selection process, which can be
addressed by employing a regularization method called dropout. Fast Random
Forest (FRF) is a powerful ensemble classifier especially when the datasets are
noisy and when the number of attributes is large in comparison to the number of
instances, as is the case of Bioinformatics datasets. Several publicly
available Bioinformatics dataset, Handwritten digits recognition and Image
segmentation dataset are considered for evaluation of the proposed approach.
The excellent performance obtained by the proposed DCNN based feature selection
with FRF classifier on high dimensional datasets makes it a fast and accurate
classifier in comparison the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:title>Reliability of universal decoding based on vector-quantized codewords</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Merhav, Neri</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Motivated by applications of biometric identification and content
identification systems, we consider the problem of random coding for channels,
where each codeword undergoes lossy compression (vector quantization), and
where the decoder bases its decision only on the compressed codewords and the
channel output, which is in turn, the channel's response to the transmission of
an original codeword, before compression. For memoryless sources and memoryless
channels with finite alphabets, we propose a new universal decoder and analyze
its error exponent, which improves on an earlier result by Dasarathy and Draper
(2011), who used the classic maximum mutual information (MMI) universal
decoder. Further, we show that our universal decoder provides the same error
exponent as that of the optimal, maximum likelihood (ML) decoder, at least as
long as all single-letter transition probabilities of the channel are positive.
We conjecture that the same argument remains true even without this positivity
condition.

 <dc:title>Approachability of convex sets in generalized quitting games</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider Blackwell approachability, a very powerful and geometric tool in
game theory, used for example to design strategies of the uninformed player in
repeated games with incomplete information. We extend this theory to
&quot;generalized quitting games&quot; , a class of repeated stochastic games in which
each player may have quitting actions, such as the Big-Match. We provide three
simple geometric and strongly related conditions for the weak approachability
of a convex target set. The first is sufficient: it guarantees that, for any
fixed horizon, a player has a strategy ensuring that the expected time-average
payoff vector converges to the target set as horizon goes to infinity. The
third is necessary: if it is not satisfied, the opponent can weakly exclude the
target set. In the special case where only the approaching player can quit the
game (Big-Match of type I), the three conditions are equivalent and coincide
with Blackwell's condition. Consequently, we obtain a full characterization and
prove that the game is weakly determined-every convex set is either weakly
approachable or weakly excludable. In games where only the opponent can quit
(Big-Match of type II), none of our conditions is both sufficient and necessary
for weak approachability. We provide a continuous time sufficient condition
using techniques coming from differential games, and show its usefulness in
practice, in the spirit of Vieille's seminal work for weak
approachability.Finally, we study uniform approachability where the strategy
should not depend on the horizon and demonstrate that, in contrast with
classical Blackwell approacha-bility for convex sets, weak approachability does
not imply uniform approachability.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A signal machine is an abstract geometrical model for computation, proposed
as an extension to the one-dimensional cellular automata, in which discrete
time and space of cellular automata is replaced with continuous time and space
in signal machine. A signal machine is defined as a set of meta-signals and a
set of rules. A signal machine starts from an initial configuration which is a
set of moving signals. Signals are moving in space freely until a collision.
Rules of signal machine specify what happens after a collision, or in other
words, specify out-coming signals for each set of colliding signals. Originally
signal machine is defined by its rule as a deterministic machine. In this
paper, we introduce the concept of non-deterministic signal machine, which may
contain more than one defined rule for each set of colliding signals. We show
that for a specific class of nondeterministic signal machines, called
k-restricted nondeterministic signal machine, there is a deterministic signal
machine computing the same result as the nondeterministic one, on any given
initial configuration. k-restricted nondeterministic signal machine is a
nondeterministic signal machine which accepts an input iff produces a special
accepting signal, which have at most two nondeterministic rule for each
collision, and at most k collisions before any acceptance.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Consider a communication scenario over a noiseless channel where a sender is
required to broadcast messages to multiple receivers, each having side
information about some messages. In this scenario, the sender can leverage the
receivers' side information during the encoding of messages in order to reduce
the required transmissions. This type of encoding is called index coding. In
this paper, we study index coding with two cooperative senders, each with some
subset of messages, and multiple receivers, each requesting one unique message.
The index coding in this setup is called two-sender unicast index coding
(TSUIC). The main aim of TSUIC is to minimize the total number of transmissions
required by the two senders. Based on graph-theoretic approaches, we prove that
TSUIC is equivalent to single-sender unicast index coding (SSUIC) for some
special cases. Moreover, we extend the existing schemes for SSUIC, viz., the
cycle-cover scheme, the clique-cover scheme, and the local-chromatic scheme to
the corresponding schemes for TSUIC.

 <dc:description>  Finding maximum-cardinality matchings in undirected graphs is arguably one of
the most central graph primitives. For $m$-edge and $n$-vertex graphs, it is
well-known to be solvable in $O(m\sqrt{n})$ time; however, for several
applications this running time is still too slow. We investigate how
linear-time (and almost linear-time) data reduction (used as preprocessing) can
alleviate the situation. More specifically, we focus on (almost) linear-time
kernelization. We start a deeper and systematic study both for general graphs
and for bipartite graphs. Our data reduction algorithms easily comply (in form
of preprocessing) with every solution strategy (exact, approximate, heuristic),
thus making them attractive in various settings.

  Matching on cocomparability graphs is moved to another paper (title: &quot;A

 <dc:description>  We study user preference between allocentric and egocentric 3D manipulation
on mobile devices, in a configuration where the motion of the device is applied
to an object displayed on the device itself. We first evaluate this preference
for translations and for rotations alone, then for full 6-DOF manipulation. We
also investigate the role of contextual cues by performing this experiment in
different 3D scenes. Finally, we look at the specific influence of each
manipulation axis. Our results provide guidelines to help interface designers
select an appropriate default mapping in this locally coupled configuration.

 <dc:description>  Maintaining multiple wireless connections is a promising solution to boost
capacity in fifth-generation (5G) networks, where user equipment is able to
consume radio resources of several serving cells simultaneously and potentially
aggregate bandwidth across all of them. The emerging dual connectivity paradigm
can be regarded as an attractive access mechanism in dense heterogeneous 5G
networks, where bandwidth sharing and cooperative techniques are evolving to
meet the increased capacity requirements. Dual connectivity in the uplink
remained highly controversial, since the user device has a limited power budget
to share between two different access points, especially when located close to
the cell edge. On the other hand, in an attempt to enhance the uplink
communications performance, the concept of uplink and downlink decoupling has
recently been introduced. Leveraging these latest developments, our work
significantly advances prior art by proposing and investigating the concept of
flexible cell association in dual connectivity scenarios, where users are able
to aggregate resources from more than one serving cell. In this setup, the
preferred association policies for the uplink may differ from those for the
downlink, thereby allowing for a truly decoupled access. With the use of
stochastic geometry, the dual connectivity association regions for decoupled
access are derived and the resultant performance is evaluated in terms of
capacity gains over the conventional downlink received power access policies.

 <dc:title>A generic framework for the development of geospatial processing
  pipelines on clusters</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cresson, Remi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The amount of remote sensing data available to applications is constantly
growing due to the rise of very-high-resolution sensors and short repeat cycle
satellites. Consequently, tackling computational complexity in Earth
Observation information extraction is rising as a major challenge. Resorting to
High Performance Computing (HPC) is becoming a common practice, since it
provides environments and programming facilities able to speed-up processes. In
particular, clusters are flexible, cost-effective systems able to perform
data-intensive tasks ideally fulfilling any computational requirement. However,
their use typically implies a significant coding effort to build proper
implementations of specific processing pipelines. This paper presents a generic
framework for the development of RS images processing applications targeting
cluster computing. It is based on common open sources libraries, and leverages
the parallelization of a wide variety of image processing pipelines in a
transparent way. Performances on typical RS tasks implemented using the
proposed framework demonstrate a great potential for the effective and timely
processing of large amount of data.

 <dc:description>  Usually one compares the accuracy of two competing classifiers via null
hypothesis significance tests (nhst). Yet the nhst tests suffer from important
shortcomings, which can be overcome by switching to Bayesian hypothesis
testing. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model which jointly analyzes the
cross-validation results obtained by two classifiers on multiple data sets. It
returns the posterior probability of the accuracies of the two classifiers
being practically equivalent or significantly different. A further strength of
the hierarchical model is that, by jointly analyzing the results obtained on
all data sets, it reduces the estimation error compared to the usual approach
of averaging the cross-validation results obtained on a given data set.

 <dc:title>The Famine of Forte: Few Search Problems Greatly Favor Your Algorithm</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Casting machine learning as a type of search, we demonstrate that the
proportion of problems that are favorable for a fixed algorithm is strictly
bounded, such that no single algorithm can perform well over a large fraction
of them. Our results explain why we must either continue to develop new
learning methods year after year or move towards highly parameterized models
that are both flexible and sensitive to their hyperparameters. We further give
an upper bound on the expected performance for a search algorithm as a function
of the mutual information between the target and the information resource
(e.g., training dataset), proving the importance of certain types of dependence
for machine learning. Lastly, we show that the expected per-query probability
of success for an algorithm is mathematically equivalent to a single-query
probability of success under a distribution (called a search strategy), and
prove that the proportion of favorable strategies is also strictly bounded.
Thus, whether one holds fixed the search algorithm and considers all possible
problems or one fixes the search problem and looks at all possible search
strategies, favorable matches are exceedingly rare. The forte (strength) of any
algorithm is quantifiably restricted.

 <dc:description>  Many automatic theorem provers are restricted to untyped logics, and existing
translations from typed logics are bulky or unsound. Recent research proposes
monotonicity as a means to remove some clutter when translating monomorphic to
untyped first-order logic. Here we pursue this approach systematically,
analysing formally a variety of encodings that further improve on efficiency
while retaining soundness and completeness. We extend the approach to rank-1
polymorphism and present alternative schemes that lighten the translation of
polymorphic symbols based on the novel notion of &quot;cover&quot;. The new encodings are
implemented in Isabelle/HOL as part of the Sledgehammer tool. We include
informal proofs of soundness and correctness, and have formalised the
monomorphic part of this work in Isabelle/HOL. Our evaluation finds the new
encodings vastly superior to previous schemes.

 <dc:title>Models of Level-0 Behavior for Predicting Human Behavior in Games</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wright, James R.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Leyton-Brown, Kevin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Behavioral game theory seeks to describe the way actual people (as compared
to idealized, &quot;rational&quot; agents) act in strategic situations. Our own recent
work has identified iterative models (such as quantal cognitive hierarchy) as
the state of the art for predicting human play in unrepeated, simultaneous-move
games (Wright &amp; Leyton-Brown 2012, 2016). Iterative models predict that agents
reason iteratively about their opponents, building up from a specification of
nonstrategic behavior called level-0. The modeler is in principle free to
choose any description of level-0 behavior that makes sense for the setting.
However, almost all existing work specifies this behavior as a uniform
distribution over actions. In most games it is not plausible that even
nonstrategic agents would choose an action uniformly at random, nor that other
agents would expect them to do so. A more accurate model for level-0 behavior
has the potential to dramatically improve predictions of human behavior, since
a substantial fraction of agents may play level-0 strategies directly, and
furthermore since iterative models ground all higher-level strategies in
responses to the level-0 strategy. Our work considers models of the way in
which level-0 agents construct a probability distribution over actions, given
an arbitrary game. Using a Bayesian optimization package called SMAC (Hutter,
Hoos, &amp; Leyton-Brown, 2010, 2011, 2012), we systematically evaluated a large
space of such models, each of which makes its prediction based only on general
features that can be computed from any normal form game. In the end, we
recommend a model that achieved excellent performance across the board: a
linear weighting of features that requires the estimation of four weights. We
evaluated the effects of combining this new level-0 model with several
iterative models, and observed large improvements in the models' predictive
accuracies.

 <dc:description>  We show that, by using multiplicative weights in a game-theoretic thought
experiment (and an important convexity result on the composition of
multiplicative weights with the relative entropy function), a symmetric
bimatrix game (that is, a bimatrix matrix wherein the payoff matrix of each
player is the transpose of the payoff matrix of the other) either has an
interior symmetric equilibrium or there is a pure strategy that is weakly
dominated by some mixed strategy. Weakly dominated pure strategies can be
detected and eliminated in polynomial time by solving a linear program.
Furthermore, interior symmetric equilibria are a special case of a more general
notion, namely, that of an &quot;equalizer,&quot; which can also be computed efficiently
in polynomial time by solving a linear program. An elegant &quot;symmetrization
method&quot; of bimatrix games [Jurg et al., 1992] and the well-known
PPAD-completeness results on equilibrium computation in bimatrix games
[Daskalakis et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2009] imply then the compelling P =
PPAD.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Codes for storage systems aim to minimize the repair locality, which is the
number of disks (or nodes) that participate in the repair of a single failed
disk. Simultaneously, the code must sustain a high rate, operate on a small
finite field to be practically significant and be tolerant to a large number of
erasures. To this end, we construct new families of binary linear codes that
have an optimal dimension (rate) for a given minimum distance and locality.
Specifically, we construct cyclic codes that are locally repairable for
locality 2 and distances 2, 6 and 10. In doing so, we discover new upper bounds
on the code dimension, and prove the optimality of enabling local repair by
provisioning disjoint groups of disks. Finally, we extend our construction to
build codes that have multiple repair sets for each disk.

 <dc:description>  We address an anomaly detection setting in which training sequences are
unavailable and anomalies are scored independently of temporal ordering.
Current algorithms in anomaly detection are based on the classical density
estimation approach of learning high-dimensional models and finding
low-probability events. These algorithms are sensitive to the order in which
anomalies appear and require either training data or early context assumptions
that do not hold for longer, more complex videos. By defining anomalies as
examples that can be distinguished from other examples in the same video, our
definition inspires a shift in approaches from classical density estimation to
simple discriminative learning. Our contributions include a novel framework for
anomaly detection that is (1) independent of temporal ordering of anomalies,
and (2) unsupervised, requiring no separate training sequences. We show that
our algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art results even when we adjust the
setting by removing training sequences from standard datasets.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem to control a population of noncooperative
heterogeneous agents, each with convex cost function depending on the average
population state, and all sharing a convex constraint, towards an aggregative
equilibrium. We assume an information structure through which a central
coordinator has access to the average population state and can broadcast
control signals for steering the decentralized optimal responses of the agents.
We design a dynamic control law that, based on operator theoretic arguments,
ensures global convergence to an equilibrium independently on the problem data,
that are the cost functions and the constraints, local and global, of the
agents. We illustrate the proposed method in two application domains: network
congestion control and demand side management.

 <dc:description>  The benefit of localized features within the regular domain has given rise to
the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in machine learning, with great
proficiency in the image classification. The use of CNNs becomes problematic
within the irregular spatial domain due to design and convolution of a kernel
filter being non-trivial. One solution to this problem is to utilize graph
signal processing techniques and the convolution theorem to perform
convolutions on the graph of the irregular domain to obtain feature map
responses to learnt filters. We propose graph convolution and pooling operators
analogous to those in the regular domain. We also provide gradient calculations
on the input data and spectral filters, which allow for the deep learning of an
irregular spatial domain problem. Signal filters take the form of spectral
multipliers, applying convolution in the graph spectral domain. Applying smooth
multipliers results in localized convolutions in the spatial domain, with
smoother multipliers providing sharper feature maps. Algebraic Multigrid is
presented as a graph pooling method, reducing the resolution of the graph
through agglomeration of nodes between layers of the network. Evaluation of
performance on the MNIST digit classification problem in both the regular and
irregular domain is presented, with comparison drawn to standard CNN. The
proposed graph CNN provides a deep learning method for the irregular domains
present in the machine learning community, obtaining 94.23% on the regular
grid, and 94.96% on a spatially irregular subsampled MNIST.

 <dc:description>  A novel variational autoencoder is developed to model images, as well as
associated labels or captions. The Deep Generative Deconvolutional Network
(DGDN) is used as a decoder of the latent image features, and a deep
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used as an image encoder; the CNN is used
to approximate a distribution for the latent DGDN features/code. The latent
code is also linked to generative models for labels (Bayesian support vector
machine) or captions (recurrent neural network). When predicting a
label/caption for a new image at test, averaging is performed across the
distribution of latent codes; this is computationally efficient as a
consequence of the learned CNN-based encoder. Since the framework is capable of
modeling the image in the presence/absence of associated labels/captions, a new
semi-supervised setting is manifested for CNN learning with images; the
framework even allows unsupervised CNN learning, based on images alone.

 <dc:description>  We present a structural clustering algorithm for large-scale datasets of
small labeled graphs, utilizing a frequent subgraph sampling strategy. A set of
representatives provides an intuitive description of each cluster, supports the
clustering process, and helps to interpret the clustering results. The
projection-based nature of the clustering approach allows us to bypass
dimensionality and feature extraction problems that arise in the context of
graph datasets reduced to pairwise distances or feature vectors. While
achieving high quality and (human) interpretable clusterings, the runtime of
the algorithm only grows linearly with the number of graphs. Furthermore, the
approach is easy to parallelize and therefore suitable for very large datasets.
Our extensive experimental evaluation on synthetic and real world datasets
demonstrates the superiority of our approach over existing structural and
subspace clustering algorithms, both, from a runtime and quality point of view.

 <dc:description>  Model predictive control (MPC) is a popular control method that has proved
effective for robotics, among other fields. MPC performs re-planning at every
time step. Re-planning is done with a limited horizon per computational and
real-time constraints and often also for robustness to potential model errors.
However, the limited horizon leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we
consider the iterative learning setting, where the same task can be repeated
several times, and propose a policy improvement scheme for MPC. The main idea
is that between executions we can, offline, run MPC with a longer horizon,
resulting in a hindsight plan. To bring the next real-world execution closer to
the hindsight plan, our approach learns to re-shape the original cost function
with the goal of satisfying the following property: short horizon planning (as
realistic during real executions) with respect to the shaped cost should result
in mimicking the hindsight plan. This effectively consolidates long-term
reasoning into the short-horizon planning. We empirically evaluate our approach
in contact-rich manipulation tasks both in simulated and real environments,
such as peg insertion by a real PR2 robot.

languages (DSL 2016). The system uses only byte representations in a deep
residual network (ResNet). The system, named ResIdent, is trained only on the
data released with the task (closed training). We obtain 84.88% accuracy on
subtask A, 68.80% accuracy on subtask B1, and 69.80% accuracy on subtask B2. A
large difference in accuracy on development data can be observed with
relatively minor changes in our network's architecture and hyperparameters. We
therefore expect fine-tuning of these parameters to yield higher accuracies.

 <dc:description>  Semantic Web of Things (SWoT) applications focus on providing a wide-scale
interoperability that allows the sharing of IoT devices across domains and the
reusing of available knowledge on the web. However, the application development
is difficult because developers have to do various tasks such as designing an
application, annotating IoT data, interpreting data, and combining application
domains.
  To address the above challenges, this paper demonstrates SWoTSuite, a toolkit
for prototyping SWoT applications. It hides the use of semantic web
technologies as much as possible to avoid the burden of designing SWoT
applications that involves designing ontologies, annotating sensor data, and
using reasoning mechanisms to enrich data. Taking inspiration from sharing and
reuse approaches, SWoTSuite reuses data and vocabularies. It leverages existing
technologies to build applications. We take a hello world naturopathy
application as an example and demonstrate an application development process
using SWoTSuite. The demo video is available at URL:

 <dc:description>  We train a deep convolutional neural network to perform identity
classification using a new dataset of public figures annotated with age,
gender, ethnicity and emotion labels, and then fine-tune it for attribute
classification. An optimal sharing pattern of computational resources within
this network is determined by experiment, requiring only 1 G flops to produce
all predictions. Rather than fine-tune by relearning weights in one additional
layer after the penultimate layer of the identity network, we try several
different depths for each attribute. We find that prediction of age and emotion
is improved by fine-tuning from earlier layers onward, presumably because
deeper layers are progressively invariant to non-identity related changes in
the input.

 <dc:description>  Natural language processing techniques are increasingly applied to identify

methods typically rely on surface lexical and syntactic information. Yet,
research in psychology shows that patterns of human conceptualisation, such as
metaphorical framing, are reliable predictors of human expectations and
decisions. In this paper, we present a method to learn patterns of metaphorical
framing from large text collections, using statistical techniques. We apply the
method to data in three different languages and evaluate the identified
patterns, demonstrating their psychological validity.

 <dc:description>  Recently, end-to-end learning frameworks are gaining prevalence in the field
of robot control. These frameworks input states/images and directly predict the
torques or the action parameters. However, these approaches are often critiqued
due to their huge data requirements for learning a task. The argument of the
difficulty in scalability to multiple tasks is well founded, since training
these tasks often require hundreds or thousands of examples. But do end-to-end
approaches need to learn a unique model for every task? Intuitively, it seems
that sharing across tasks should help since all tasks require some common
understanding of the environment. In this paper, we attempt to take the next
step in data-driven end-to-end learning frameworks: move from the realm of
task-specific models to joint learning of multiple robot tasks. In an
astonishing result we show that models with multi-task learning tend to perform
better than task-specific models trained with same amounts of data. For
example, a deep-network learned with 2.5K grasp and 2.5K push examples performs
better on grasping than a network trained on 5K grasp examples.

 <dc:description>  Rumour stance classification, the task that determines if each tweet in a
collection discussing a rumour is supporting, denying, questioning or simply
commenting on the rumour, has been attracting substantial interest. Here we
introduce a novel approach that makes use of the sequence of transitions
observed in tree-structured conversation threads in Twitter. The conversation
threads are formed by harvesting users' replies to one another, which results
in a nested tree-like structure. Previous work addressing the stance
classification task has treated each tweet as a separate unit. Here we analyse
tweets by virtue of their position in a sequence and test two sequential
classifiers, Linear-Chain CRF and Tree CRF, each of which makes different
assumptions about the conversational structure. We experiment with eight
Twitter datasets, collected during breaking news, and show that exploiting the
sequential structure of Twitter conversations achieves significant improvements
over the non-sequential methods. Our work is the first to model Twitter
conversations as a tree structure in this manner, introducing a novel way of
tackling NLP tasks on Twitter conversations.

 <dc:description>  We propose an online pricing mechanism for electric vehicle (EV) charging. A
charging station decides prices for each arriving EV depending on the energy
and the time within which the EV will be served (i.e. deadline). The user
selects either one of the contracts by paying the prescribed price or rejects
all depending on their surpluses. The charging station can serve users using
renewable energy and conventional energy. Users may select longer deadlines as
they may have to pay less because of the less amount of conventional energy,
however, they have to wait a longer period. We consider a {\em myopic} charging
station and show that there exists a pricing mechanism which jointly maximizes
the social welfare and the profit of the charging station when the charging
station knows the utilities of the users. However, when the charging station
does not know the utilities of the users, the social welfare pricing strategy
may not maximize the expected profit of the charging station and even the
profit may be $0$. We propose a fixed profit pricing strategy which provides a
guaranteed fixed profit to the charging station and can maximize the profit in
practice. We empirically show that our proposed mechanism reduces the
peak-demand and utilizes the limited charging spots in a charging station
efficiently.

 <dc:title>A Moving Target Approach for Identifying Malicious Sensors in Control
  Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Weerakkody, Sean</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sinopoli, Bruno</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of attack identification in
cyber-physical systems (CPS). Attack identification is often critical for the
recovery and performance of a CPS that is targeted by malicious entities,
allowing defenders to construct algorithms which bypass harmful nodes. Previous
work has characterized limitations in the perfect identification of adversarial
attacks on deterministic LTI systems. For instance, a system must remain
observable after removing any 2q sensors to only identify q attacks. However,
the ability for an attacker to create an unidentifiable attack requires
knowledge of the system model. In this paper, we aim to limit the adversary's
knowledge of the system model with the goal of accurately identifying all
sensor attacks. Such a scheme will allow systems to withstand larger attacks or
system operators to allocate fewer sensing devices to a control system while
maintaining security. We explore how changing the dynamics of the system as a
function of time allows us to actively identify malicious/faulty sensors in a
control system. We discuss the design of time varying system matrices to meet
this goal and evaluate performance in deterministic and stochastic systems.

 <dc:description>  The fisherman caught a quantum fish. &quot;Fisherman, please let me go&quot;, begged
the fish, &quot;and I will grant you three wishes&quot;. The fisherman agreed. The fish
gave the fisherman a quantum computer, three quantum signing tokens and his
classical public key. The fish explained: &quot;to sign your three wishes, use the
tokenized signature scheme on this quantum computer, then show your valid
signature to the king, who owes me a favor&quot;.
  The fisherman used one of the signing tokens to sign the document &quot;give me a
castle!&quot; and rushed to the palace. The king executed the classical verification
algorithm using the fish's public key, and since it was valid, the king
complied.
  The fisherman's wife wanted to sign ten wishes using their two remaining
signing tokens. The fisherman did not want to cheat, and secretly sailed to
meet the fish. &quot;Fish, my wife wants to sign ten more wishes&quot;. But the fish was
not worried: &quot;I have learned quantum cryptography following the previous story
(The Fisherman and His Wife by the brothers Grimm). The quantum tokens are
consumed during the signing. Your polynomial wife cannot even sign four wishes
using the three signing tokens I gave you&quot;.
  &quot;How does it work?&quot; wondered the fisherman. &quot;Have you heard of quantum money?
These are quantum states which can be easily verified but are hard to copy.
This tokenized quantum signature scheme extends Aaronson and Christiano's
quantum money scheme, which is why the signing tokens cannot be copied&quot;.
  &quot;Does your scheme have additional fancy properties?&quot; the fisherman asked.
&quot;Yes, the scheme has other security guarantees: revocability, testability and
everlasting security. Furthermore, if you're at sea and your quantum phone has
only classical reception, you can use this scheme to transfer the value of the
quantum money to shore&quot;, said the fish, and swam away.

 <dc:description>  Tensegrity robots, composed of rigid rods connected by elastic cables, have a
number of unique properties that make them appealing for use as planetary
exploration rovers. However, control of tensegrity robots remains a difficult
problem due to their unusual structures and complex dynamics. In this work, we
show how locomotion gaits can be learned automatically using a novel extension
of mirror descent guided policy search (MDGPS) applied to periodic locomotion
movements, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on tensegrity
robot locomotion. We evaluate our method with real-world and simulated
experiments on the SUPERball tensegrity robot, showing that the learned
policies generalize to changes in system parameters, unreliable sensor
measurements, and variation in environmental conditions, including varied
terrains and a range of different gravities. Our experiments demonstrate that
our method not only learns fast, power-efficient feedback policies for rolling
gaits, but that these policies can succeed with only the limited onboard
sensing provided by SUPERball's accelerometers. We compare the learned feedback
policies to learned open-loop policies and hand-engineered controllers, and
demonstrate that the learned policy enables the first continuous, reliable
locomotion gait for the real SUPERball robot. Our code and other supplementary

 <dc:title>A Simple, Fast and Highly-Accurate Algorithm to Recover 3D Shape from 2D

 <dc:description>  Three-dimensional shape reconstruction of 2D landmark points on a single
image is a hallmark of human vision, but is a task that has been proven
difficult for computer vision algorithms. We define a feed-forward deep neural
network algorithm that can reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D landmark points almost
perfectly (i.e., with extremely small reconstruction errors), even when these
2D landmarks are from a single image. Our experimental results show an
improvement of up to two-fold over state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms;
3D shape reconstruction of human faces is given at a reconstruction error &lt;
.004, cars at .0022, human bodies at .022, and highly-deformable flags at an
error of .0004. Our algorithm was also a top performer at the 2016 3D Face
Alignment in the Wild Challenge competition (done in conjunction with the
European Conference on Computer Vision, ECCV) that required the reconstruction
of 3D face shape from a single image. The derived algorithm can be trained in a
couple hours and testing runs at more than 1, 000 frames/s on an i7 desktop. We
also present an innovative data augmentation approach that allows us to train
the system efficiently with small number of samples. And the system is robust
to noise (e.g., imprecise landmark points) and missing data (e.g., occluded or
undetected landmark points).

 <dc:title>Better Data Visibility &amp; Data Use Result in Lower Cost and Improved

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In 2013-2014, Tanzania embarked on a major revamp of the management of its
public health supply chains for medicines and other health supplies. These
upgrades include the establishment of a national electronic logistics
management information system (eLMIS) and the introduction of a Logistics
Management Unit (LMU) to use the eLMIS for managing all key public health
commodities. This paper describes results from the &quot;round one&quot; evaluation of
the impact of those key management upgrades roughly one year after their
introduction. The study has three main components: (1) analysis of reporting,
data use, management practices, and supply chain outcomes; (2) a cost and
cost-effectiveness analysis and (3) a return on investment analysis to measure
savings generated by the new systems. The study used a non-experimental pre-
and post-design to compare the previous system with the upgraded management
system. The quantitative analysis found that stock out rates for all product
goods dropped from 32% to 23%, with the frequency of stock-outs greater than 7
days dropping from 24% to 15%. Annual supply chain costs increased from
$66million to $76million. Performance improved from the 2014 baseline findings
of 68% to 77%, but cost per value of commodities adjusted for performance
decreased from 58% at baseline to 50% in year 1.

 <dc:description>  According to the United States High Commission for Refugees (UNHCr), there
are 65.3 million forcibly displaced people in the world today, 21.5 million of
them being refugees. This has led to an unprecedented refugee crisis which has
led countries to accept refugee families and to resettle them. Diverse agencies
are helping refugees coming to US to resettle and start their new life in the
country. One of the first and most challenging steps of this process is to find
affordable housing that also meets a suite of additional constraints and
priorities. These include being within a mile of public transportation and near
schools, faith centers and international grocery stores. We detail an
interactive data-driven web-based tool, which incorporates in one consolidated
platform most of the needed information. The tool searches, filters and
demonstrates a list of possible housing locations, and allows for the dynamic
prioritization based on user-specified importance weights on the diverse
criteria. The platform was created in a partnership with New American Pathways,
a nonprofit that supports refugee resettlement in the metro Atlanta, but
exemplifies a methodology that can help many other organizations with similar
goals.

 <dc:title>Using Big Data to Decode Private Sector Wage Growth</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The U.S. labor market is dynamic and complex, and understanding wage data
across different segments of the workforce is critical to providing
policymakers and business leaders with actionable insights. There is no labor
index that assesses the labor market performance at such a detailed level as
the ADP Research Institute's Workforce Vitality Report (WVR). Drawing on the
actual, aggregated and anonymous payroll data of 24 million Americans paid by
ADP, the WVR looks at key dynamics and market indicators including wage growth,
hours worked and turnover rate. Unlike other data sets, the WVR calculates wage
growth of individual workers on a quarter-to-quarter basis, avoiding the
deviations caused by various workplace occurrences, like when new workers are
hired and older ones retire. In this paper, Dr. Ahu Yildirmaz, head of the ADP
Research Institute, drills down into wage growth by industry, age, gender and
income level, as well as for both job holders and job switchers. Using WVR
data, Ahu walks through those factors contributing to overall shifts in wage
growth, the future of the labor market and what this data means for today's
U.S. workforce.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this article we will present a graph partitioning algorithm which
partitions a graph into two different types of components: the well-known
`strongly connected components' as well as another type of components we call
`connected acyclic component'. We will give an algorithm based on Tarjan's
algorithm for finding strongly connected components used to find such a
partitioning. We will also show that the partitioning given by the algorithm is
unique and that the underlying graph can be represented as a directed acyclic
graph (similar to a pure strongly connected component partitioning).
  In the second part we will show how such an partitioning of a graph can be
used to calculate PageRank of a graph effectively by calculating PageRank for
different components on the same `level' in parallel as well as allowing for
the use of different types of PageRank algorithms for different types of
components.
  To evaluate the method we have calculated PageRank on four large example
graphs and compared it with a basic approach, as well as our algorithm in a
serial as well as parallel implementation.

 <dc:description>  We propose a model for representing a point mass subject to Coulomb friction
in feedback with a PID controller, based on a differential inclusion comprising
all the possible magnitudes of static friction during the stick phase. For this
model we study the set of all equilibria and we establish its global asymptotic
stability using a discontinuous Lyapunov-like function, and a suitable
LaSalle's invariance principle. We finally use well-posedness of the proposed
model to establish useful robustness results, including an ISS property from a
suitable input in a perturbed context. Simulation results are also given to
illustrate our statements.

 <dc:description>  This work explores hypernetworks: an approach of using a one network, also
known as a hypernetwork, to generate the weights for another network.
Hypernetworks provide an abstraction that is similar to what is found in
nature: the relationship between a genotype - the hypernetwork - and a
phenotype - the main network. Though they are also reminiscent of HyperNEAT in
evolution, our hypernetworks are trained end-to-end with backpropagation and
thus are usually faster. The focus of this work is to make hypernetworks useful
for deep convolutional networks and long recurrent networks, where
hypernetworks can be viewed as relaxed form of weight-sharing across layers.
Our main result is that hypernetworks can generate non-shared weights for LSTM
and achieve near state-of-the-art results on a variety of sequence modelling
tasks including character-level language modelling, handwriting generation and
neural machine translation, challenging the weight-sharing paradigm for
recurrent networks. Our results also show that hypernetworks applied to
convolutional networks still achieve respectable results for image recognition
tasks compared to state-of-the-art baseline models while requiring fewer
learnable parameters.

extensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite size scaling to study the critical

belong to the largest domain of an absorbing configuration averaged over many
runs. We find that it vanishes as $\rho \sim \left (q_c^0 - q \right)^\beta$
with $\beta \approx 0.25$ at the critical point $q_c^0 \approx 3.10$ and that
the exponent that measures the width of the critical region is $\nu^0 \approx
2.1$. In addition, we find that introduction of long-range links by rewiring
the nearest-neighbors links of the square lattice with probability $p$ turns
the transition discontinuous, with the critical point $q_c^p$ increasing from
$3.1$ to $27.17$, approximately, as $p$ increases from $0$ to $1$. The
sharpness of the threshold, as measured by the exponent $\nu^p \approx 1$ for
$p&gt;0$, increases with the square root of the number of nodes of the resulting
small-world network.

 <dc:description>  Self-organizing map(SOM) have been widely applied in clustering, this paper
focused on centroids of clusters and what they reveal. When the input vectors
consists of time, latitude and longitude, the map can be strongly linked to
physical world, providing valuable information. Beyond basic clustering, a
novel approach to address the temporal element is developed, enabling 3D SOM to
track behaviors in multiple periods concurrently. Combined with adaptations
targeting to process heterogeneous data relating to distribution in time and
space, the paper offers a fresh scope for business and services based on
temporal-spatial pattern.

and clique number at most Delta is Delta-colorable, and thus it has an
independent set of size at least n/Delta. We give an approximate

 <dc:description>  Computed tomography (CT) generates a stack of cross-sectional images covering
a region of the body. The visual assessment of these images for the
identification of potential abnormalities is a challenging and time consuming
task due to the large amount of information that needs to be processed. In this
article we propose a deep artificial neural network architecture, ReCTnet, for
the fully-automated detection of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. The
architecture learns to distinguish nodules and normal structures at the pixel
level and generates three-dimensional probability maps highlighting areas that
are likely to harbour the objects of interest. Convolutional and recurrent
layers are combined to learn expressive image representations exploiting the
spatial dependencies across axial slices. We demonstrate that leveraging
intra-slice dependencies substantially increases the sensitivity to detect
pulmonary nodules without inflating the false positive rate. On the publicly
available LIDC/IDRI dataset consisting of 1,018 annotated CT scans, ReCTnet
reaches a detection sensitivity of 90.5% with an average of 4.5 false positives
per scan. Comparisons with a competing multi-channel convolutional neural
network for multi-slice segmentation and other published methodologies using
the same dataset provide evidence that ReCTnet offers significant performance
gains.

 <dc:title>Fusing Similarity Models with Markov Chains for Sparse Sequential
  Recommendation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Predicting personalized sequential behavior is a key task for recommender
systems. In order to predict user actions such as the next product to purchase,
movie to watch, or place to visit, it is essential to take into account both
long-term user preferences and sequential patterns (i.e., short-term dynamics).
Matrix Factorization and Markov Chain methods have emerged as two separate but
powerful paradigms for modeling the two respectively. Combining these ideas has
led to unified methods that accommodate long- and short-term dynamics
simultaneously by modeling pairwise user-item and item-item interactions.
  In spite of the success of such methods for tackling dense data, they are
challenged by sparsity issues, which are prevalent in real-world datasets. In
recent years, similarity-based methods have been proposed for
(sequentially-unaware) item recommendation with promising results on sparse
datasets. In this paper, we propose to fuse such methods with Markov Chains to
make personalized sequential recommendations. We evaluate our method, Fossil,
on a variety of large, real-world datasets. We show quantitatively that Fossil
outperforms alternative algorithms, especially on sparse datasets, and
qualitatively that it captures personalized dynamics and is able to make
meaningful recommendations.

 <dc:description>  Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is the problem of determining two
non-negative low rank factors $W$ and $H$, for the given input matrix $A$, such
that $A \approx W H$. NMF is a useful tool for many applications in different
domains such as topic modeling in text mining, background separation in video
analysis, and community detection in social networks. Despite its popularity in
the data mining community, there is a lack of efficient parallel algorithms to
solve the problem for big data sets.
  The main contribution of this work is a new, high-performance parallel
computational framework for a broad class of NMF algorithms that iteratively
solves alternating non-negative least squares (NLS) subproblems for $W$ and
$H$. It maintains the data and factor matrices in memory (distributed across
processors), uses MPI for interprocessor communication, and, in the dense case,
provably minimizes communication costs (under mild assumptions). The framework
is flexible and able to leverage a variety of NMF and NLS algorithms, including
Multiplicative Update, Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares, and Block
Principal Pivoting. Our implementation allows us to benchmark and compare
different algorithms on massive dense and sparse data matrices of size that
spans for few hundreds of millions to billions. We demonstrate the scalability
of our algorithm and compare it with baseline implementations, showing
significant performance improvements. The code and the datasets used for
conducting the experiments are available online.

 <dc:description>  Multi-object tracking has recently become an important area of computer
vision, especially for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Despite
growing attention, achieving high performance tracking is still challenging,
with state-of-the- art systems resulting in high complexity with a large number
of hyper parameters. In this paper, we focus on reducing overall system
complexity and the number hyper parameters that need to be tuned to a specific
environment. We introduce a novel tracking system based on similarity mapping
by Enhanced Siamese Neural Network (ESNN), which accounts for both appearance
and geometric information, and is trainable end-to-end. Our system achieves
competitive performance in both speed and accuracy on MOT16 challenge, compared
to known state-of-the-art methods.

in terms of work done by the University of Cambridge in partnership with a

 <dc:description>  The efficiency of the human brain in performing classification tasks has
attracted considerable research interest in brain-inspired neuromorphic
computing. Hardware implementations of a neuromorphic system aims to mimic the
computations in the brain through interconnection of neurons and synaptic
weights. A leaky-integrate-fire (LIF) spiking model is widely used to emulate
the dynamics of neuronal action potentials. In this work, we propose a spin
based LIF spiking neuron using the magneto-electric (ME) switching of
ferro-magnets. The voltage across the ME oxide exhibits a typical
leaky-integrate behavior, which in turn switches an underlying ferro-magnet.
Due to the effect of thermal noise, the ferro-magnet exhibits probabilistic
switching dynamics, which is reminiscent of the stochasticity exhibited by
biological neurons. The energy-efficiency of the ME switching mechanism coupled
with the intrinsic non-volatility of ferro-magnets result in lower energy
consumption, when compared to a CMOS LIF neuron. A device to system-level
simulation framework has been developed to investigate the feasibility of the
proposed LIF neuron for a hand-written digit recognition problem

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates a three-node multiple-input multiple-output relay
system suffering from co-channel interference (CCI) at the multi-antenna relay.
Contrary to the conventional relay networks, we consider the scenario that the
relay is an energy harvesting (EH) node and has no embedded energy supply. But
it is equipped with a rechargeable battery such that it can harvest and
accumulate the harvested energy from RF signals sent by the source and
co-channel interferers to support its operation. Leveraging the inherent
feature of the considered system, we develop a novel accumulate-then-forward
(ATF) protocol to eliminate the harmful effect of CCI. In the proposed ATF
scheme, at the beginning of each transmission block, the relay can choose
either EH operation to harvest energy from source and CCI or information
decoding (ID) operation to decode and forward source's information while
suffering from CCI. Specifically, ID operation is activated only when the
accumulated energy at the relay can support an outage-free transmission in the
second hop. Otherwise, EH operation is invoked at the relay to harvest and
accumulate energy. By modeling the finite-capacity battery of relay as a
finite-state Markov Chain (MC), we derive a closed-form expression for the
system throughput of the proposed ATF scheme over mixed Nakagami-m and Rayleigh
fading channels. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis, and show
that the proposed ATF scheme with energy accumulation significantly outperforms
the existing one without energy accumulation.

 <dc:description>  Given a database, the private information retrieval (PIR) protocol allows a
user to make queries to several servers and retrieve a certain item of the
database via the feedbacks, without revealing the privacy of the specific item
to any single server. Classical models of PIR protocols require that each
server stores a whole copy of the database. Recently new PIR models are
proposed with coding techniques arising from distributed storage system. In
these new models each server only stores a fraction $1/s$ of the whole
database, where $s&gt;1$ is a given rational number. PIR array codes are recently
proposed by Fazeli, Vardy and Yaakobi to characterize the new models. Consider
a PIR array code with $m$ servers and the $k$-PIR property (which indicates
that these $m$ servers may emulate any efficient $k$-PIR protocol). The central
problem is to design PIR array codes with optimal rate $k/m$. Our contribution
to this problem is three-fold. First, for the case $1&lt;s\le 2$, although PIR
array codes with optimal rate have been constructed recently by Blackburn and
Etzion, the number of servers in their construction is impractically large. We
determine the minimum number of servers admitting the existence of a PIR array
code with optimal rate for a certain range of parameters. Second, for the case
$s&gt;2$, we derive a new upper bound on the rate of a PIR array code. Finally,
for the case $s&gt;2$, we analyze a new construction by Blackburn and Etzion and
show that its rate is better than all the other existing constructions.

 <dc:description>  Hidden Markov model (HMM) has been well studied and extensively used. In this
paper, we present DPHMM ({Differentially Private Hidden Markov Model}), an HMM
embedded with a private data release mechanism, in which the privacy of the
data is protected through a graph. Specifically, we treat every state in Markov
model as a node, and use a graph to represent the privacy policy, in which
&quot;indistinguishability&quot; between states is denoted by edges between nodes. Due to
the temporal correlations in Markov model, we show that the graph may be
reduced to a subgraph with disconnected nodes, which become unprotected and
might be exposed. To detect such privacy risk, we define sensitivity hull and
degree of protection based on the graph to capture the condition of information
exposure. Then to tackle the detected exposure, we study how to build an
optimal graph based on the existing graph. We also implement and evaluate the
DPHMM on real-world datasets, showing that privacy and utility can be better
tuned with customized policy graph.

 <dc:description>  To achieve a low computational cost when performing online metric learning
for large-scale data, we present a one-pass closed-form solution namely OPML in
this paper. Typically, the proposed OPML first adopts a one-pass triplet
construction strategy, which aims to use only a very small number of triplets
to approximate the representation ability of whole original triplets obtained
by batch-manner methods. Then, OPML employs a closed-form solution to update
the metric for new coming samples, which leads to a low space (i.e., $O(d)$)
and time (i.e., $O(d^2)$) complexity, where $d$ is the feature dimensionality.
In addition, an extension of OPML (namely COPML) is further proposed to enhance
the robustness when in real case the first several samples come from the same
class (i.e., cold start problem). In the experiments, we have systematically
evaluated our methods (OPML and COPML) on three typical tasks, including UCI
data classification, face verification, and abnormal event detection in videos,
which aims to fully evaluate the proposed methods on different sample number,
different feature dimensionalities and different feature extraction ways (i.e.,
hand-crafted and deeply-learned). The results show that OPML and COPML can
obtain the promising performance with a very low computational cost. Also, the
effectiveness of COPML under the cold start setting is experimentally verified.

 <dc:description>  This work deals with a class of problems under interval data uncertainty,
namely interval robust-hard problems, composed of interval data min-max regret
generalizations of classical NP-hard combinatorial problems modeled as 0-1
integer linear programming problems. These problems are more challenging than
other interval data min-max regret problems, as solely computing the cost of
any feasible solution requires solving an instance of an NP-hard problem. The
state-of-the-art exact algorithms in the literature are based on the generation
of a possibly exponential number of cuts. As each cut separation involves the
resolution of an NP-hard classical optimization problem, the size of the
instances that can be solved efficiently is relatively small. To smooth this
issue, we present a modeling technique for interval robust-hard problems in the
context of a heuristic framework. The heuristic obtains feasible solutions by
exploring dual information of a linearly relaxed model associated with the
classical optimization problem counterpart. Computational experiments for
interval data min-max regret versions of the restricted shortest path problem
and the set covering problem show that our heuristic is able to find optimal or
near-optimal solutions and also improves the primal bounds obtained by a
state-of-the-art exact algorithm and a 2-approximation procedure for interval
data min-max regret problems.

 <dc:description>  Academic researchers often need to face with a large collection of research
papers in the literature. This problem may be even worse for postgraduate
students who are new to a field and may not know where to start. To address
this problem, we have developed an online catalog of research papers where the
papers have been automatically categorized by a topic model. The catalog
contains 7719 papers from the proceedings of two artificial intelligence
conferences from 2000 to 2015. Rather than the commonly used Latent Dirichlet
Allocation, we use a recently proposed method called hierarchical latent tree
analysis for topic modeling. The resulting topic model contains a hierarchy of
topics so that users can browse the topics from the top level to the bottom
level. The topic model contains a manageable number of general topics at the
top level and allows thousands of fine-grained topics at the bottom level. It
also can detect topics that have emerged recently.

 <dc:description>  Recently, much progress has been made in learning general-purpose sentence
representations that can be used across domains. However, most of the existing
models typically treat each word in a sentence equally. In contrast, extensive
studies have proven that human read sentences efficiently by making a sequence
of fixation and saccades. This motivates us to improve sentence representations
by assigning different weights to the vectors of the component words, which can
be treated as an attention mechanism on single sentences. To that end, we
propose two novel attention models, in which the attention weights are derived
using significant predictors of human reading time, i.e., Surprisal, POS tags
and CCG supertags. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
methods significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art sentence representation
models.

 <dc:description>  Developing predictive modelling solutions for risk estimation is extremely
challenging in health-care informatics. Risk estimation involves integration of
heterogeneous clinical sources having different representation from different
health-care provider making the task increasingly complex. Such sources are
typically voluminous, diverse, and significantly change over the time.
Therefore, distributed and parallel computing tools collectively termed big
data tools are in need which can synthesize and assist the physician to make
right clinical decisions. In this work we propose multi-model predictive
architecture, a novel approach for combining the predictive ability of multiple
models for better prediction accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed work on data from Framingham Heart study. Results
show that the proposed multi-model predictive architecture is able to provide
better accuracy than best model approach. By modelling the error of predictive
models we are able to choose sub set of models which yields accurate results.
More information was modelled into system by multi-level mining which has
resulted in enhanced predictive accuracy.

 <dc:title>EXTRACT: Strong Examples from Weakly-Labeled Sensor Data</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Thanks to the rise of wearable and connected devices, sensor-generated time
series comprise a large and growing fraction of the world's data.
Unfortunately, extracting value from this data can be challenging, since
sensors report low-level signals (e.g., acceleration), not the high-level
events that are typically of interest (e.g., gestures). We introduce a
technique to bridge this gap by automatically extracting examples of real-world
events in low-level data, given only a rough estimate of when these events have
taken place.
  By identifying sets of features that repeat in the same temporal arrangement,
we isolate examples of such diverse events as human actions, power consumption
patterns, and spoken words with up to 96% precision and recall. Our method is
fast enough to run in real time and assumes only minimal knowledge of which
variables are relevant or the lengths of events. Our evaluation uses numerous
publicly available datasets and over 1 million samples of manually labeled
sensor data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a supervised dictionary learning algorithm that
aims to preserve the local geometry in both dimensions of the data. A
graph-based regularization explicitly takes into account the local manifold
structure of the data points. A second graph regularization gives similar
treatment to the feature domain and helps in learning a more robust dictionary.
Both graphs can be constructed from the training data or learned and adapted
along the dictionary learning process. The combination of these two terms
promotes the discriminative power of the learned sparse representations and
leads to improved classification accuracy. The proposed method was evaluated on
several different datasets, representing both single-label and multi-label
classification problems, and demonstrated better performance compared with
other dictionary based approaches.

 <dc:description>  Distributed consensus with data rate constraint is an important research
topic of multi-agent systems. Some results have been obtained for consensus of
multi-agent systems with integrator dynamics, but it remains challenging for
general high-order systems, especially in the presence of unmeasurable states.
In this paper, we study the quantized consensus problem for a special kind of
high-order systems and investigate the corresponding data rate required for
achieving consensus. The state matrix of each agent is a 2m-th order real
Jordan block admitting m identical pairs of conjugate poles on the unit circle;
each agent has a single input, and only the first state variable can be
measured. The case of harmonic oscillators corresponding to m=1 is first
investigated under a directed communication topology which contains a spanning
tree, while the general case of m &gt;= 2 is considered for a connected and
undirected network. In both cases it is concluded that the sufficient number of
communication bits to guarantee the consensus at an exponential convergence
rate is an integer between $m$ and $2m$, depending on the location of the
poles.

 <dc:description>  Advancements in technology have transformed mobile devices from being mere
communication widgets to versatile computing devices. Proliferation of these
hand held devices has made them a common means to access and process digital
information. Most web based applications are today available in a form that can
conveniently be accessed over mobile devices. However, webservices
(applications meant for consumption by other applications rather than humans)
are not as commonly provided and consumed over mobile devices. Facilitating
this and in effect realizing a service-oriented system over mobile devices has
the potential to further enhance the potential of mobile devices. One of the
major challenges in this integration is the lack of an efficient service
registry system that caters to issues associated with the dynamic and volatile
mobile environments. Existing service registry technologies designed for
traditional systems fall short of accommodating such issues. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach to manage service registry systems provided 'solely'
over mobile devices, and thus realising an SOA without the need for high-end
computing systems. The approach manages a dynamic service registry system in
the form of light weight and distributed registries. We assess the feasibility
of our approach by engineering and deploying a working prototype of the
proposed registry system over actual mobile devices. A comparative study of the
proposed approach and the traditional UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery,
and Integration) registry is also included. The evaluation of our framework has
shown propitious results in terms of battery cost, scalability, hindrance with
native applications.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we suggest a new algorithm for determination of signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR). SNR is a quantitative measure widely used in science and
engineering. Generally, methods for determination of SNR are based on using of
experimentally defined power of noise level, or some conditional noise
criterion which can be specified for signal processing. In the present work we
describe method for determination of SNR of chaotic and stochastic signals at
unknown power levels of signal and noise. For this aim we use information as
difference between unconditional and conditional entropy. Our theoretical
results are confirmed by results of analysis of signals which can be described
by nonlinear maps and presented as overlapping of harmonic and stochastic
signals.

this generator can discover blocks of plaintext with lower complexity than
exhaustive search of space of key generator. Results indicated that the
mentioned generator is lack of the security claimed by authors.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce a novel method for general semantic segmentation
that can benefit from general semantics of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Our segmentation proposes visually and semantically coherent image segments. We
use binary encoding of CNN features to overcome the difficulty of the
clustering on the high-dimensional CNN feature space. These binary codes are
very robust against noise and non-semantic changes in the image. These binary
encoding can be embedded into the CNN as an extra layer at the end of the
network. This results in real-time segmentation. To the best of our knowledge
our method is the first attempt on general semantic image segmentation using
CNN. All the previous papers were limited to few number of category of the
images (e.g. PASCAL VOC). Experiments show that our segmentation algorithm
outperform the state-of-the-art non-semantic segmentation methods by large
margin.

 <dc:description>  Web application providers have been migrating their applications to cloud
data centers, attracted by the emerging cloud computing paradigm. One of the
appealing features of the cloud is elasticity. It allows cloud users to acquire
or release computing resources on-demand, which enables web application
providers to automatically scale the resources provisioned to their
applications without human intervention under a dynamic workload to minimize
resource cost while satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this
paper, we comprehensively analyze the challenges that remain in auto-scaling
web applications in clouds and review the developments in this field. We
present a taxonomy of auto-scalers according to the identified challenges and
key properties. We analyze the surveyed works and map them to the taxonomy to
identify the weaknesses in this field. Moreover, based on the analysis, we
propose new future directions that can be explored in this area.

 <dc:description>  With the rapid growth of social media, rumors are also spreading widely on
social media and bring harm to people's daily life. Nowadays, information
credibility evaluation has drawn attention from academic and industrial
communities. Current methods mainly focus on feature engineering and achieve
some success. However, feature engineering based methods require a lot of labor
and cannot fully reveal the underlying relations among data. In our viewpoint,
the key elements of user behaviors for evaluating credibility are concluded as
&quot;who&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, and &quot;how&quot;. These existing methods cannot model the
correlation among different key elements during the spreading of microblogs. In
this paper, we propose a novel representation learning method, Information
Credibility Evaluation (ICE), to learn representations of information
credibility on social media. In ICE, latent representations are learnt for
modeling user credibility, behavior types, temporal properties, and comment
attitudes. The aggregation of these factors in the microblog spreading process
yields the representation of a user's behavior, and the aggregation of these
dynamic representations generates the credibility representation of an event
spreading on social media. Moreover, a pairwise learning method is applied to
maximize the credibility difference between rumors and non-rumors. To evaluate
the performance of ICE, we conduct experiments on a Sina Weibo data set, and
the experimental results show that our ICE model outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  We present Bharati, a simple, novel script that can represent the characters
of a majority of contemporary Indian scripts. The shapes/motifs of Bharati
characters are drawn from some of the simplest characters of existing Indian
scripts. Bharati characters are designed such that they strictly reflect the
underlying phonetic organization, thereby attributing to the script qualities
of simplicity, familiarity, ease of acquisition and use. Thus, employing
Bharati script as a common script for a majority of Indian languages can
ameliorate several existing communication bottlenecks in India. We perform a
complexity analysis of handwritten Bharati script and compare its complexity
with that of 9 major Indian scripts. The measures of complexity are derived
from a theory of handwritten characters based on Catastrophe theory. Bharati
script is shown to be simpler than the 9 major Indian scripts in most measures
of complexity.

 <dc:description>  Decompositions of tensors into factor matrices, which interact through a core
tensor, have found numerous applications in signal processing and machine
learning. A more general tensor model which represents data as an ordered
network of sub-tensors of order-2 or order-3 has, so far, not been widely
considered in these fields, although this so-called tensor network
decomposition has been long studied in quantum physics and scientific
computing. In this study, we present novel algorithms and applications of
tensor network decompositions, with a particular focus on the tensor train
decomposition and its variants. The novel algorithms developed for the tensor
train decomposition update, in an alternating way, one or several core tensors
at each iteration, and exhibit enhanced mathematical tractability and
scalability to exceedingly large-scale data tensors. The proposed algorithms
are tested in classic paradigms of blind source separation from a single
mixture, denoising, and feature extraction, and achieve superior performance
over the widely used truncated algorithms for tensor train decomposition.

 <dc:title>Low Rank and Sparsity Analysis Applied to Speech Enhancement via Online

 <dc:creator>Sun, Pengfei</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Qin, Jun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose an online estimated dictionary based single channel speech
enhancement algorithm, which focuses on low rank and sparse matrix
decomposition. In this proposed algorithm, a noisy speech spectral matrix is
considered as the summation of low rank background noise components and an
activation of the online speech dictionary, on which both low rank and sparsity
constraints are imposed. This decomposition takes the advantage of local
estimated dictionary high expressiveness on speech components. The local
dictionary can be obtained through estimating the speech presence probability
by applying Expectation Maximal algorithm, in which a generalized Gamma prior
for speech magnitude spectrum is used. The evaluation results show that the
proposed algorithm achieves significant improvements when compared to four
other speech enhancement algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Yaakobi et al. introduced codes for $b$-symbol read channels, where
the read operation is performed as a consecutive sequence of $b&gt;2$ symbols. In
this paper, we establish a Singleton-type bound on $b$-symbol codes. Codes
meeting the Singleton-type bound are called maximum distance separable (MDS)
codes, and they are optimal in the sense they attain the maximal minimum
$b$-distance. Based on projective geometry and constacyclic codes, we construct
new families of linear MDS $b$-symbol codes over finite fields. And in some
sense, we completely determine the existence of linear MDS $b$-symbol codes
over finite fields for certain parameters.

 <dc:description>  The problem of detecting changes in a scene and segmenting the foreground
from background is still challenging, despite previous work. Moreover, new RGBD
capturing devices include depth cues, which could be incorporated to improve
foreground segmentation. In this work, we present a new nonparametric approach
where a unified model mixes the device multiple information cues. In order to
unify all the device channel cues, a new probabilistic depth data model is also
proposed where we show how handle the inaccurate data to improve foreground
segmentation. A new RGBD video dataset is presented in order to introduce a new
standard for comparison purposes of this kind of algorithms. Results show that
the proposed approach can handle several practical situations and obtain good
results in all cases.

 <dc:description>  Recently, these has been a surge on studying how to obtain partially
annotated data for model supervision. However, there still lacks a systematic
study on how to train statistical models with partial annotation (PA). Taking
dependency parsing as our case study, this paper describes and compares two
straightforward approaches for three mainstream dependency parsers. The first
approach is previously proposed to directly train a log-linear graph-based
parser (LLGPar) with PA based on a forest-based objective. This work for the
first time proposes the second approach to directly training a linear
graph-based parse (LGPar) and a linear transition-based parser (LTPar) with PA
based on the idea of constrained decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on
Penn Treebank under three different settings for simulating PA, i.e., random
dependencies, most uncertain dependencies, and dependencies with divergent
outputs from the three parsers. The results show that LLGPar is most effective
in learning from PA and LTPar lags behind the graph-based counterparts by large
margin. Moreover, LGPar and LTPar can achieve best performance by using LLGPar
to complete PA into full annotation (FA).

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel framework for visual object recognition using
infinite-dimensional covariance operators of input features in the paradigm of
kernel methods on infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. Our formulation
provides in particular a rich representation of image features by exploiting
their non-linear correlations. Theoretically, we provide a finite-dimensional
approximation of the Log-Hilbert-Schmidt (Log-HS) distance between covariance
operators that is scalable to large datasets, while maintaining an effective
discriminating capability. This allows us to efficiently approximate any
continuous shift-invariant kernel defined using the Log-HS distance. At the
same time, we prove that the Log-HS inner product between covariance operators
is only approximable by its finite-dimensional counterpart in a very limited
scenario. Consequently, kernels defined using the Log-HS inner product, such as
polynomial kernels, are not scalable in the same way as shift-invariant
kernels. Computationally, we apply the approximate Log-HS distance formulation
to covariance operators of both handcrafted and convolutional features,
exploiting both the expressiveness of these features and the power of the
covariance representation. Empirically, we tested our framework on the task of
image classification on twelve challenging datasets. In almost all cases, the
results obtained outperform other state of the art methods, demonstrating the
competitiveness and potential of our framework.

 <dc:title>Heuristic with elements of tabu search for Truck and Trailer Routing

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Vehicle Routing Problem is a well-known problem in logistics and
transportation, and the variety of such problems is explained by the fact that
it occurs in many real-life situations. It is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem and finding an exact optimal solution is practically
impossible. In this work, Site-Dependent Truck and Trailer Routing Problem with
hard and soft Time Windows and Split Deliveries is considered (SDTTRPTWSD). In
this article, we develop a heuristic with the elements of Tabu Search for
solving SDTTRPTWSD. The heuristic uses the concept of neighborhoods and visits
infeasible solutions during the search. A greedy heuristic is applied to
construct an initial solution.

 <dc:description>  Detecting moving objects in dynamic scenes from sequences of lidar scans is
an important task in object tracking, mapping, localization, and navigation.
Many works focus on changes detection in previously observed scenes, while a
very limited amount of literature addresses moving objects detection. The
state-of-the-art method exploits Dempster-Shafer Theory to evaluate the
occupancy of a lidar scan and to discriminate points belonging to the static
scene from moving ones. In this paper we improve both speed and accuracy of
this method by discretizing the occupancy representation, and by removing false
positives through visual cues. Many false positives lying on the ground plane
are also removed thanks to a novel ground plane removal algorithm. Efficiency
is improved through an octree indexing strategy. Experimental evaluation
against the KITTI public dataset shows the effectiveness of our approach, both
qualitatively and quantitatively with respect to the state- of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  In the paper which inspired the SC-Square project, [E. Abraham, Building
Bridges between Symbolic Computation and Satisfiability Checking, Proc. ISSAC
'15, pp. 1-6, ACM, 2015] the author identified the use of sophisticated
heuristics as a technique that the Satisfiability Checking community excels in
and from which it is likely the Symbolic Computation community could learn and
prosper. To start this learning process we summarise our experience with
heuristic development for the computer algebra algorithm Cylindrical Algebraic
Decomposition. We also propose and discuss standards and benchmarks as another
area where Symbolic Computation could prosper from Satisfiability Checking
expertise, noting that these have been identified as initial actions for the
new SC-Square community in the CSA project, as described in [E.~Abraham et al.,
SC$^2$: Satisfiability Checking meets Symbolic Computation (Project Paper)},
Intelligent Computer Mathematics (LNCS 9761), pp. 28--43, Springer, 2015].

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a method of estimating the geometry of a room and the 3D
pose of objects from a single 360-degree panorama image. Assuming Manhattan
World geometry, we formulate the task as a Bayesian inference problem in which
we estimate positions and orientations of walls and objects. The method
combines surface normal estimation, 2D object detection and 3D object pose
estimation. Quantitative results are presented on a dataset of synthetically
generated 3D rooms containing objects, as well as on a subset of hand-labeled
images from the public SUN360 dataset.

 <dc:title>Knapsack problem for automaton groups</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The knapsack problem is a classic optimisation problem that has been recently
extended in the setting of groups. Its study reveals to be interesting since it
provides many different behaviours, depending on the considered class of
groups. In this paper we deal with groups generated by Mealy automata-a class
that is often used to study group-theoretical conjectures-and prove that the
knapsack problem is undecidable for this class. In a second time, we construct
a graph that, if finite, provides a solution to the knapsack problem. We deduce
that the knapsack problem is decidable for the so-called bounded automaton
groups, a class where the order and conjugacy problems are already known to be
decidable.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: This article has been withdrawn due to a conceptual error in the
  proof of the decidability of the problem for bounded automata. The
  undecidability result remains true</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  We revisit the approach to Byzantine fault-tolerant clock synchronization
based on approximate agreement introduced by Lynch and Welch. Our contribution
is threefold:
  (1) We provide a slightly refined variant of the algorithm yielding improved
bounds on the skew that can be achieved and the sustainable frequency offsets.
  (2) We show how to extend the technique to also synchronize clock rates. This
permits less frequent communication without significant loss of precision,
provided that clock rates change sufficiently slowly.
  (3) We present a coupling scheme that allows to make these algorithms
self-stabilizing while preserving their high precision. The scheme utilizes a
low-precision, but self-stabilizing algorithm for the purpose of recovery.

 <dc:title>Formula Slicing: Inductive Invariants from Preconditions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Karpenkov, Egor George</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Monniaux, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a &quot;formula slicing&quot; method for finding inductive invariants. It is
based on the observation that many loops in the program affect only a small
part of the memory, and many invariants which were valid before a loop are
still valid after.
  Given a precondition of the loop, obtained from the preceding program
fragment, we weaken it until it becomes inductive. The weakening procedure is
guided by counterexamples-to-induction given by an SMT solver. Our algorithm
applies to programs with arbitrary loop structure, and it computes the
strongest invariant in an abstract domain of weakenings of preconditions. We
call this algorithm &quot;formula slicing&quot;, as it effectively performs &quot;slicing&quot; on
formulas derived from symbolic execution.
  We evaluate our algorithm on the device driver benchmarks from the
International Competition on Software Verification (SV-COMP), and we show that
it is competitive with the state-of-the-art verification techniques.

 <dc:description>  We show that many infinite classes of permutations over finite fields can be
constructed via translators with a large choice of parameters. We first charac-
terize some functions having linear translators, based on which several
families of permutations are then derived. Extending the results of [10], we
give in several cases the compositional inverse of these permutations. The
connection with complete permutations is also utilized to provide further
infinite classes of permutations. Moreover, we propose new tools to study
permutations of the form x is mapped to x+(x^(p^m) - x+ lambda)^s and a few
infinite classes of permutations of this form are proposed.

 <dc:description>  In order to boost the performance of data-intensive computing on HPC systems,
in-memory computing frameworks, such as Apache Spark and Flink, use local DRAM
for data storage. Optimizing the memory allocation to data storage is critical
to delivering performance to traditional HPC compute jobs and throughput to
data-intensive applications sharing the HPC resources. Current practices that
statically configure in-memory storage may leave inadequate space for compute
jobs or lose the opportunity to utilize more available space for data-intensive
applications. In this paper, we explore techniques to dynamically adjust
in-memory storage and make the right amount of space for compute jobs. We have
developed a dynamic memory controller, DynIMS, which infers memory demands of
compute tasks online and employs a feedback-based control model to adapt the
capacity of in-memory storage. We test DynIMS using mixed HPCC and Spark
workloads on a HPC cluster. Experimental results show that DynIMS can achieve
up to 5X performance improvement compared to systems with static memory
allocations.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning has significantly advanced the state of the art in artificial
intelligence, gaining wide popularity from both industry and academia. Special
interest is around Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which take inspiration
from the hierarchical structure of the visual cortex, to form deep layers of
convolutional operations, along with fully connected classifiers. Hardware
implementations of these deep CNN architectures are challenged with memory
bottlenecks that require many convolution and fully-connected layers demanding
large amount of communication for parallel computation. Multi-core CPU based
solutions have demonstrated their inadequacy for this problem due to the memory
wall and low parallelism. Many-core GPU architectures show superior performance
but they consume high power and also have memory constraints due to
inconsistencies between cache and main memory. FPGA design solutions are also
actively being explored, which allow implementing the memory hierarchy using
embedded BlockRAM. This boosts the parallel use of shared memory elements
between multiple processing units, avoiding data replicability and
inconsistencies. This makes FPGAs potentially powerful solutions for real-time
classification of CNNs. Both Altera and Xilinx have adopted OpenCL co-design
framework from GPU for FPGA designs as a pseudo-automatic development solution.
In this paper, a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of Altera and Xilinx
OpenCL frameworks for a 5-layer deep CNN is presented. Hardware resources,
temporal performance and the OpenCL architecture for CNNs are discussed. Xilinx
demonstrates faster synthesis, better FPGA resource utilization and more
compact boards. Altera provides multi-platforms tools, mature design community
and better execution times.

 <dc:description>  Garnero et al. [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 2015, 29(4):1864--1894] recently
introduced a framework based on dynamic programming to make applications of the
protrusion replacement technique constructive and to obtain explicit upper
bounds on the involved constants. They show that for several graph problems,
for every boundary size $t$ one can find an explicit set $\mathcal{R}_t$ of
representatives. Any subgraph $H$ with a boundary of size $t$ can be replaced
with a representative $H' \in \mathcal{R}_t$ such that the effect of this
replacement on the optimum can be deduced from $H$ and $H'$ alone. Their upper
bounds on the size of the graphs in $\mathcal{R}_t$ grow triple-exponentially
with $t$. In this paper we complement their results by lower bounds on the
sizes of representatives, in terms of the boundary size $t$. For example, we
show that each set of planar representatives $\mathcal{R}_t$ for Independent
Set or Dominating Set contains a graph with $\Omega(2^t / \sqrt{4t})$ vertices.
This lower bound even holds for sets that only represent the planar subgraphs
of bounded pathwidth. To obtain our results we provide a lower bound on the
number of equivalence classes of the canonical equivalence relation for
Independent Set on $t$-boundaried graphs. We also find an elegant
characterization of the number of equivalence classes in general graphs, in
terms of the number of monotone functions of a certain kind. Our results show
that the number of equivalence classes is at most $2^{2^t}$, improving on
earlier bounds of the form $(t+1)^{2^t}$.

 <dc:description>  The matching problem is a notorious combinatorial optimization problem that
has attracted for many years the attention of the statistical physics
community. Here we analyze the Euclidean version of the problem, i.e. the
optimal matching problem between points randomly distributed on a
$d$-dimensional Euclidean space, where the cost to minimize depends on the
points' pairwise distances. Using Mayer's cluster expansion we write a formal
expression for the replicated action that is suitable for a saddle point
computation. We give the diagrammatic rules for each term of the expansion, and
we analyze in detail the one-loop diagrams. A characteristic feature of the
theory, when diagrams are perturbatively computed around the mean field part of
the action, is the vanishing of the mass at zero momentum. In the non-Euclidean
case of uncorrelated costs instead, we predict and numerically verify an
anomalous scaling for the sub-sub-leading correction to the asymptotic average
cost.

 <dc:description>  Heterogeneous wireless networks have evolved to reach application
requirements for low latency and high throughput on Internet access. Recent
studies have improved network performance employing the Multipath TCP, which
aggregates flows from heterogeneous wireless interfaces in a single connection.
Although existing proposals are powerful, coupled congestion control algorithms
are currently limited because of the high variation in path delays, bandwidth
and loss rate, typical from heterogeneous wireless networks, even more over
concurrent multipath transmissions. These transmissions experience bufferbloat,
i.e., high delays caused by long queues. Hence, to cope with the current
limitations, this work presents CoDel-LIFO, a new active queue management (AQM)
discipline to reduce the dropped packet ratio in the Multipath TCP congestion
control mechanism. Differently from other approaches, CoDel-LIFO gives priority
to the most recent packets, being then promising. This paper provides a
detailed simulation analysis over congestion control algorithms by comparing
CoDel-LIFO to CoDel and DropTail disciplines. Results indicate that CoDel-LIFO
reduces queue drops, diminishing the impact on congestion control; improving
substantially the goodput; and keeping RTT low.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel semi-supervised approach for sequence transduction and
apply it to semantic parsing. The unsupervised component is based on a
generative model in which latent sentences generate the unpaired logical forms.
We apply this method to a number of semantic parsing tasks focusing on domains

 <dc:title>k-rAC - a Fine-Grained k-Resilient Access Control Scheme for Distributed

 <dc:description>  Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are a common architecture for decentralized
applications and, therefore, would be suited for privacy-aware applications.
However, currently existing DHTs allow every peer to access any index. To build
privacy-aware applications, we need to control this access. In this paper, we
present k-rAC, a privacy-aware fine-grained AC for DHTs. For authentication, we
present three different mechanisms based on public-key cryptography,
zero-knowledge-proofs, and cryptographic hashes. For authorization, we use
distributed AC lists. The security of our approach is based on k-resilience. We
show that our approach introduces an acceptable overhead and discuss its
suitability for different scenarios.

 <dc:title>Towards performance portability through locality-awareness for
  applications using one-sided communication primitives</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  MPI is the most widely used data transfer and communication model in High
Performance Computing. The latest version of the standard, MPI-3, allows
skilled programmers to exploit all hardware capabilities of the latest and
future supercomputing systems. The revised asynchronous remote-memory-access
model in combination with the shared-memory window extension, in particular,
allow writing code that hides communication latencies and optimizes
communication paths according to the locality of data origin and destination.
The latter is particularly important for today's multi- and many-core systems.
However, writing such efficient code is highly complex and error-prone. In this
paper we evaluate a recent remote-memory-access model, namely DART-MPI. This
model claims to hide the aforementioned complexities from the programmer, but
deliver locality-aware remote-memory-access semantics which outperforms MPI-3
one-sided communication primitives on multi-core systems. Conceptually, the
DART-MPI interface is simple; at the same time it takes care of the
complexities of the underlying MPI-3 and system topology. This makes DART-MPI
an interesting candidate for porting legacy applications. We evaluate these
claims using a realistic scientific application, specifically a
finite-difference stencil code which solves the heat diffusion equation, on a
large-scale Cray XC40 installation.

 <dc:description>  There is considerable long-term interest in understanding the dynamics of
collaboration networks, and how these networks form and evolve over time. Most
of the work done on the dynamics of social networks focuses on well-established
communities. Work examining emerging social networks is rarer, simply because
data is difficult to obtain in real time. In this paper, we use thirty years of
data from an emerging scientific community to look at that crucial early stage
in the development of a social network. We show that when the field was very
young, islands of individual researchers labored in relative isolation, and the
coauthorship network was disconnected. Thirty years later, rather than a
cluster of individuals, we find a true collaborative community, bound together
by a robust collaboration network. However, this change did not take place
gradually\textemdash the network remained a loose assortment of isolated
individuals until the mid-2000s, when those smaller parts suddenly knit
themselves together into a single whole. In the rest of this paper, we consider
the role of three factors in these observed structural changes: growth, changes
in social norms, and the introduction of institutions such as field-specific
conferences and journals. We have data from the very earliest years of the
field, a period which includes the introduction of two different institutions:
the first field-specific conference, and the first field-specific journals. We
also identify two relevant behavioral shifts: a discrete increase in
coauthorship coincident with the first conference, and a shift among
established authors away from collaborating with outsiders, towards
collaborating with each other. The interaction of these factors gives us
insight into the formation of collaboration networks more broadly.

 <dc:description>  This research explores the potential to analyze bank card payments and ATM
cash withdrawals in order to map and quantify how people are impacted by and
recover from natural disasters. Our approach defines a disaster-affected
community's economic recovery time as the time needed to return to baseline
activity levels in terms of number of bank card payments and ATM cash
withdrawals. For Hurricane Odile, which hit the state of Baja California Sur
(BCS) in Mexico between 15 and 17 September 2014, we measured and mapped
communities' economic recovery time, which ranged from 2 to 40 days in
different locations. We found that -- among individuals with a bank account --
the lower the income level, the shorter the time needed for economic activity
to return to normal levels. Gender differences in recovery times were also
detected and quantified. In addition, our approach evaluated how communities
prepared for the disaster by quantifying expenditure growth in food or gasoline
before the hurricane struck. We believe this approach opens a new frontier in
measuring the economic impact of disasters with high temporal and spatial
resolution, and in understanding how populations bounce back and adapt.

 <dc:description>  The present survey aims at presenting the current machine learning techniques
employed in security games domains. Specifically, we focused on papers and
works developed by the Teamcore of University of Southern California, which
deepened different directions in this field. After a brief introduction on
Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs) and the poaching setting, the rest of the
work presents how to model a boundedly rational attacker taking into account
her human behavior, then describes how to face the problem of having attacker's
payoffs not defined and how to estimate them and, finally, presents how online
learning techniques have been exploited to learn a model of the attacker.

 <dc:description>  Understanding how species are distributed across landscapes over time is a
fundamental question in biodiversity research. Unfortunately, most species
distribution models only target a single species at a time, despite strong
ecological evidence that species are not independently distributed. We propose
Deep Multi-Species Embedding (DMSE), which jointly embeds vectors corresponding
to multiple species as well as vectors representing environmental covariates
into a common high-dimensional feature space via a deep neural network. Applied
to bird observational data from the citizen science project \textit{eBird}, we
demonstrate how the DMSE model discovers inter-species relationships to
outperform single-species distribution models (random forests and SVMs) as well
as competing multi-label models. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefit of
using a deep neural network to extract features within the embedding and show
how they improve the predictive performance of species distribution modelling.
An important domain contribution of the DMSE model is the ability to discover
and describe species interactions while simultaneously learning the shared
habitat preferences among species. As an additional contribution, we provide a
graphical embedding of hundreds of bird species in the Northeast US.

 <dc:description>  The decoding performance of polar codes strongly depends on the decoding
algorithm used, while also the decoder throughput and its latency mainly depend
on the decoding algorithm. In this work, we implement the powerful successive
cancellation list (SCL) decoder on a GPU and identify the bottlenecks of this
algorithm with respect to parallel computing and its difficulties. The inherent
serial decoding property of the SCL algorithm naturally limits the achievable
speed-up gains on GPUs when compared to CPU implementations. In order to
increase the decoding throughput, we use a hybrid decoding scheme based on the
belief propagation (BP) decoder, which can be intra and inter-frame
parallelized. The proposed scheme combines excellent decoding performance and
high throughput within the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region of interest.

 <dc:description>  Acoustic emanations of computer keyboards represent a serious privacy issue.
As demonstrated in prior work, physical properties of keystroke sounds might
reveal what a user is typing. However, previous attacks assumed relatively
strong adversary models that are not very practical in many real-world
settings. Such strong models assume: (i) adversary's physical proximity to the
victim, (ii) precise profiling of the victim's typing style and keyboard,
and/or (iii) significant amount of victim's typed information (and its
corresponding sounds) available to the adversary.
  This paper presents and explores a new keyboard acoustic eavesdropping attack
that involves Voice-over-IP (VoIP), called Skype &amp; Type (S&amp;T), while avoiding
prior strong adversary assumptions. This work is motivated by the simple
observation that people often engage in secondary activities (including typing)
while participating in VoIP calls. As expected, VoIP software acquires and
faithfully transmits all sounds, including emanations of pressed keystrokes,
which can include passwords and other sensitive information. We show that one
very popular VoIP software (Skype) conveys enough audio information to
reconstruct the victim's input -- keystrokes typed on the remote keyboard. Our
results demonstrate that, given some knowledge on the victim's typing style and
keyboard model, the attacker attains top-5 accuracy of 91.7% in guessing a
random key pressed by the victim.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that S&amp;T is robust to various VoIP issues (e.g.,
Internet bandwidth fluctuations and presence of voice over keystrokes), thus
confirming feasibility of this attack. Finally, it applies to other popular
VoIP software, such as Google Hangouts.

 <dc:title>Automatic semigroups vs automaton semigroups</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Picantin, Matthieu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Group Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We develop an effective and natural approach to interpret any semigroup
admitting a special language of greedy normal forms as an automaton
semigroup,namely the semigroup generated by a Mealy automaton encoding the
behaviour of such a language of greedy normal forms under one-sided
multiplication.The framework embraces many of the well-known classes of
(automatic) semigroups: finite monoids, free semigroups, free commutative
monoids, trace or divisibility monoids, braid or Artin-Tits or Krammer or
Garside monoids, Baumslag-Solitar semigroups, etc.Like plactic monoids or
Chinese monoids, some neither left- nor right-cancellative automatic semigroups
are also investigated, as well as some residually finite variations of the
bicyclic monoid. It provides what appears to be the first known connection from
a class of automatic semigroupsto a class of automaton semigroups. It is
worthwhile noting that, in all these cases, &quot;being an automatic semigroup&quot; and
&quot;being an automaton semigroup&quot; become dual properties in a very
automata-theoretical sense. Quadratic rewriting systems and associated tilings
appear as a cornerstone of our construction.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an end-to-end approach for tracking static and dynamic
objects for an autonomous vehicle driving through crowded urban environments.
Unlike traditional approaches to tracking, this method is learned end-to-end,
and is able to directly predict a full unoccluded occupancy grid map from raw
laser input data. Inspired by the recently presented DeepTracking approach
[Ondruska, 2016], we employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the
temporal evolution of the state of the environment, and propose to use Spatial
Transformer modules to exploit estimates of the egomotion of the vehicle. Our
results demonstrate the ability to track a range of objects, including cars,
buses, pedestrians, and cyclists through occlusion, from both moving and
stationary platforms, using a single learned model. Experimental results
demonstrate that the model can also predict the future states of objects from
current inputs, with greater accuracy than previous work.

 <dc:description>  In cloud computing paradigm, virtual resource autoscaling approaches have
been intensively studied recent years. Those approaches dynamically scale
in/out virtual resources to adjust system performance for saving operation
cost. However, designing the autoscaling algorithm for desired performance with
limited budget, while considering the existing capacity of legacy network
equipment, is not a trivial task. In this paper, we propose a Deadline and
Budget Constrained Autoscaling (DBCA) algorithm for addressing the
budget-performance tradeoff. We develop an analytical model to quantify the
tradeoff and cross-validate the model by extensive simulations. The results
show that the DBCA can significantly improve system performance given the
budget upper-bound. In addition, the model provides a quick way to evaluate the
budget-performance tradeoff and system design without wide deployment, saving
on cost and time.

 <dc:description>  This work focuses on the rapid development of linguistic annotation tools for
resource-poor languages. We experiment several cross-lingual annotation
projection methods using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) models. The
distinctive feature of our approach is that our multilingual word
representation requires only a parallel corpus between the source and target
language. More precisely, our method has the following characteristics: (a) it
does not use word alignment information, (b) it does not assume any knowledge
about foreign languages, which makes it applicable to a wide range of
resource-poor languages, (c) it provides truly multilingual taggers. We
investigate both uni- and bi-directional RNN models and propose a method to
include external information (for instance low level information from POS) in
the RNN to train higher level taggers (for instance, super sense taggers). We
demonstrate the validity and genericity of our model by using parallel corpora
(obtained by manual or automatic translation). Our experiments are conducted to
induce cross-lingual POS and super sense taggers.

 <dc:title>Unified Stochastic Geometry Modeling and Analysis of Cellular Networks

 <dc:description>  Statistical characterization of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) via its cumulative distribution function (CDF) is ubiquitous in a vast
majority of technical contributions in the area of cellular networks since it
boils down to averaging the Laplace transform of the aggregate interference, a
benefit accorded at the expense of confinement to the simplistic Rayleigh
fading. In this work, to capture diverse fading channels that appear in
realistic outdoor/indoor wireless communication scenarios, we tackle the
problem differently. By exploting the moment generating function (MGF) of the
SINR, we succeed in analytically assessing cellular networks performance over
the shadowed {\kappa}-{\mu}, {\kappa}-{\mu} and {\eta}-{\mu} fading models. The
latter offer high flexibility by capturing diverse fading channels including
Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, Rician, and Rician shadow fading distributions. These
channel models have been recently praised for their capability to accurately
model dense urban environments, future femtocells and device-to-device (D2D)
shadowed channels. In addition to unifying the analysis for different channel
models, this work integrates, for the first time, the coverage, the achievable
rate, and the bit error probability (BEP), which are largely treated separately
in the literature. The developed model and analysis are validated over a broad
range of simulation setups and parameters.

 <dc:description>  The sampling of sound fields involves the measurement of spatially dependent
room impulse responses, where the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem applies in
both the temporal and spatial domain. Therefore, sampling inside a volume of
interest requires a huge number of sampling points in space, which comes along
with further difficulties such as exact microphone positioning and calibration
of multiple microphones. In this paper, we present a method for measuring sound
fields using moving microphones whose trajectories are known to the algorithm.
At that, the number of microphones is customizable by trading measurement
effort against sampling time. Through spatial interpolation of the dynamic
measurements, a system of linear equations is set up which allows for the
reconstruction of the entire sound field inside the volume of interest.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the cooperative training of two probabilistic models of
signals such as images. Both models are parametrized by convolutional neural
networks (ConvNets). The first network is a descriptor network, which is an
exponential family model or an energy-based model, whose feature statistics or
energy function are defined by a bottom-up ConvNet, which maps the observed
signal to the feature statistics. The second network is a generator network,
which is a non-linear version of factor analysis. It is defined by a top-down
ConvNet, which maps the latent factors to the observed signal. The maximum
likelihood training algorithms of both the descriptor net and the generator net
are in the form of alternating back-propagation, and both algorithms involve
Langevin sampling. We observe that the two training algorithms can cooperate
with each other by jumpstarting each other's Langevin sampling, and they can be
naturally and seamlessly interwoven into a CoopNets algorithm that can train
both nets simultaneously.

 <dc:description>  Mobile phone data have been extensively used in the recent years to study
social behavior. However, most of these studies are based on only partial data
whose coverage is limited both in space and time. In this paper, we point to an
observation that the bias due to the limited coverage in time may have an
important influence on the results of the analyses performed. In particular, we
observe significant differences, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in the
degree distribution of the network, depending on the way the dataset is
pre-processed and we present a possible explanation for the emergence of Double
Pareto LogNormal (DPLN) degree distributions in temporal data.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven very effective in image
classification and show promise for audio. We use various CNN architectures to
classify the soundtracks of a dataset of 70M training videos (5.24 million
hours) with 30,871 video-level labels. We examine fully connected Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs), AlexNet [1], VGG [2], Inception [3], and ResNet [4]. We
investigate varying the size of both training set and label vocabulary, finding
that analogs of the CNNs used in image classification do well on our audio
classification task, and larger training and label sets help up to a point. A
model using embeddings from these classifiers does much better than raw
features on the Audio Set [5] Acoustic Event Detection (AED) classification
task.

 <dc:description>  There is a growing interest in joint multi-subject fMRI analysis. The
challenge of such analysis comes from inherent anatomical and functional
variability across subjects. One approach to resolving this is a shared
response factor model. This assumes a shared and time synchronized stimulus
across subjects. Such a model can often identify shared information, but it may
not be able to pinpoint with high resolution the spatial location of this
information. In this work, we examine a searchlight based shared response model
to identify shared information in small contiguous regions (searchlights)
across the whole brain. Validation using classification tasks demonstrates that
we can pinpoint informative local regions.

 <dc:description>  In social networks the {\sc Strong Triadic Closure} is an assignment of the
edges with strong or weak labels such that any two vertices that have a common
neighbor with a strong edge are adjacent. The problem of maximizing the number
of strong edges that satisfy the strong triadic closure was recently shown to
be NP-complete for general graphs. Here we initiate the study of graph classes
for which the problem is solvable. We show that the problem admits a
polynomial-time algorithm for two unrelated classes of graphs: proper interval
graphs and trivially-perfect graphs. To complement our result, we show that the
problem remains NP-complete on split graphs, and consequently also on chordal
graphs. Thus we contribute to define the first border between graph classes on
which the problem is polynomially solvable and on which it remains NP-complete.

 <dc:description>  The massive diffusion of online social media allows for the rapid and
uncontrolled spreading of conspiracy theories, hoaxes, unsubstantiated claims,
and false news. Such an impressive amount of misinformation can influence
policy preferences and encourage behaviors strongly divergent from recommended
practices. In this paper, we study the statistical properties of viral
misinformation in online social media. By means of methods belonging to Extreme
Value Theory, we show that the number of extremely viral posts over time
follows a homogeneous Poisson process, and that the interarrival times between
such posts are independent and identically distributed, following an
exponential distribution. Moreover, we characterize the uncertainty around the
rate parameter of the Poisson process through Bayesian methods. Finally, we are
able to derive the predictive posterior probability distribution of the number
of posts exceeding a certain threshold of shares over a finite interval of
time.

 <dc:description>  We present bounded dynamic (but observer-free) output feedback laws that
achieve global stabilization of equilibrium profiles of the partial
differential equation (PDE) model of a simplified, age-structured chemostat
model. The chemostat PDE state is positive-valued, which means that our global
stabilization is established in the positive orthant of a particular function
space-a rather non-standard situation, for which we develop non-standard tools.
Our feedback laws do not employ any of the (distributed) parametric knowledge
of the model. Moreover, we provide a family of highly unconventional Control
Lyapunov Functionals (CLFs) for the age-structured chemostat PDE model. Two
kinds of feedback stabilizers are provided: stabilizers with continuously
adjusted input and sampled-data stabilizers. The results are based on the
transformation of the first-order hyperbolic partial differential equation to
an ordinary differential equation (one-dimensional) and an integral delay
equation (infinite-dimensional). Novel stability results for integral delay
equations are also provided; the results are of independent interest and allow
the explicit construction of the CLF for the age-structured chemostat model.

elimination of those noises that greatly affect the intelligibility. Two
supervised low-rank and sparse decomposition schemes are developed in the
spectral envelop subspace to obtain a robust recovery of speech components. A
Bayesian formulation of non-negative factorization is used to learn the speech
dictionary from the spectral envelop subspace of clean speech samples. In the
spectral details subspace, a standard robust principal component analysis is
implemented to extract the speech components. The validation results show that
compared with four speech enhancement algorithms, including MMSE-SPP, NMF-RPCA,
RPCA, and LARC, the proposed MS based algorithms achieve satisfactory
performance on improving perceptual quality, and especially speech
intelligibility.

 <dc:description>  Understanding, predicting, and generating object motions and transformations
is a core problem in artificial intelligence. Modeling sequences of evolving
images may provide better representations and models of motion and may
ultimately be used for forecasting, simulation, or video generation.
Diagrammatic Abstract Reasoning is an avenue in which diagrams evolve in
complex patterns and one needs to infer the underlying pattern sequence and
generate the next image in the sequence. For this, we develop a novel
Contextual Generative Adversarial Network based on Recurrent Neural Networks
(Context-RNN-GANs), where both the generator and the discriminator modules are
based on contextual history (modeled as RNNs) and the adversarial discriminator
guides the generator to produce realistic images for the particular time step
in the image sequence. We evaluate the Context-RNN-GAN model (and its variants)
on a novel dataset of Diagrammatic Abstract Reasoning, where it performs
competitively with 10th-grade human performance but there is still scope for
interesting improvements as compared to college-grade human performance. We
also evaluate our model on a standard video next-frame prediction task,
achieving improved performance over comparable state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  The boxicity $\operatorname{box}(H)$ of a graph $H$ is the smallest integer
$d$ such that $H$ is the intersection of $d$ interval graphs, or equivalently,
that $H$ is the intersection graph of axis-aligned boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
These intersection representations can be interpreted as covering
representations of the complement $H^c$ of $H$ with co-interval graphs, that
is, complements of interval graphs. We follow the recent framework of global,
local and folded covering numbers (Knauer and Ueckerdt, Discrete Mathematics
339 (2016)) to define two new parameters: the local boxicity
$\operatorname{box}_\ell(H)$ and the union boxicity
$\overline{\operatorname{box}}(H)$ of $H$. The union boxicity of $H$ is the
smallest $d$ such that $H^c$ can be covered with $d$ vertex-disjoint unions of
co-interval graphs, while the local boxicity of $H$ is the smallest $d$ such
that $H^c$ can be covered with co-interval graphs, at most $d$ at every vertex.
  We show that for every graph $H$ we have $\operatorname{box}_\ell(H) \leq
\overline{\operatorname{box}}(H) \leq \operatorname{box}(H)$ and that each of
these inequalities can be arbitrarily far apart. Moreover, we show that local
and union boxicity are also characterized by intersection representations of
appropriate axis-aligned boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We demonstrate with a few
striking examples, that in a sense, the local boxicity is a better indication
for the complexity of a graph, than the classical boxicity.

 <dc:description>  We analyze in this paper finite horizon hierarchical signaling games between
(information provider) senders and (decision maker) receivers in a dynamic
environment. The underlying information evolves in time while sender and
receiver interact repeatedly. Different from the classical communication
(control) models, however, the sender (sensor) and the receiver (controller)
have different objectives and there is a hierarchy between the players such
that the sender leads the game by announcing his policies beforehand. He needs
to anticipate the reaction of the receiver and the impact of the actions on the
horizon while controlling the transparency of the disclosed information at each
interaction. With quadratic cost functions and multi-variate Gaussian
processes, evolving according to first order auto-regressive models, we show
that memoryless linear sender signaling rules are optimal (in the sense of
game-theoretic hierarchical equilibrium) within the general class of
strategies. We also show that, again in the non-cooperative control context,
linear signaling rules and correspondingly linear control input yield the
hierarchical equilibrium within the general class of strategies.

 <dc:title>A Cross Entropy based Stochastic Approximation Algorithm for
  Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Joseph, Ajin George</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Bhatnagar, Shalabh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we provide a new algorithm for the problem of prediction in
Reinforcement Learning, \emph{i.e.}, estimating the Value Function of a Markov
Reward Process (MRP) using the linear function approximation architecture, with
memory and computation costs scaling quadratically in the size of the feature
set. The algorithm is a multi-timescale variant of the very popular Cross
Entropy (CE) method which is a model based search method to find the global
optimum of a real-valued function. This is the first time a model based search
method is used for the prediction problem. The application of CE to a
stochastic setting is a completely unexplored domain. A proof of convergence
using the ODE method is provided. The theoretical results are supplemented with
experimental comparisons. The algorithm achieves good performance fairly
consistently on many RL benchmark problems. This demonstrates the
competitiveness of our algorithm against least squares and other
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of computational efficiency, accuracy and
stability.

 <dc:description>  Although binarization is considered passe, it still remains a highly popular
research topic. In this paper we propose a rethinking of what binarization is.
We introduce the notion of the visual archetype as the ideal form of any one
document. Binarization can be defined as the restoration of the visual
archetype for a class of images. This definition broadens the scope of what
binarization means but also suggests ground-truth should focus on the
foreground.

demonstrate an inner bound on the rate at which Alice may transmit, while still
granting Bob the ability to authenticate. Furthermore this is accomplished in
spite of Alice and Bob lacking a pre-shared key, as well as allowing Eve prior
knowledge of both the codebook Alice and Bob share and the messages Alice

 <dc:title>Distributed Navigation of Multi-Robot Systems For Sensing Coverage</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This research investigates decentralized control of mobile robots
specifically for coverage problems. There are different approaches associated
with decentralized control strategy for coverage control problems. We perform a
comparative review of these approaches and use the approach based on simple
local coordination rules. We investigate this extensively used nearest
neighbour rule based approach for developing coverage control algorithms. In
this approach, a mobile robot gives an equal importance to every neighbour
robot coming under its communication range. We develop our control approach by
making some of the mobile robots playing a more influential role than other
members in the team. The approach based on this control strategy becomes
efficient in terms of achieving a consensus on control inputs, say heading
angle, velocity, etc. The decentralized control of mobile robots can also
exhibit a cyclic behaviour under some physical constraints like a quantized
orientation of mobile robot. We further investigate the cyclic behaviour
appearing due to the quantized control of mobile robots under some conditions.
Our nearest neighbour rule based approach offers a biased strategy in case of
cyclic behaviour appearing in the team of mobile robots. We consider a
clustering technique inside the team of mobile robots. Our decentralized
control strategy calculates the similarity measure among the neighbours of a
mobile robot. The team of mobile robots with the similarity measure based
approach becomes efficient in achieving a fast consensus like on heading angle
or velocity. We perform a rigorous mathematical analysis of our developed
approach. We also develop a condition based on relaxed criteria for achieving
consensus on velocity or heading angle of the mobile robots. Our validation
approach is based on mathematical arguments and extensive computer simulations.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach for reconstructing vehicles from a single (RGB) image,
in the context of autonomous driving. Though the problem appears to be
ill-posed, we demonstrate that prior knowledge about how 3D shapes of vehicles
project to an image can be used to reason about the reverse process, i.e., how
shapes (back-)project from 2D to 3D. We encode this knowledge in \emph{shape
priors}, which are learnt over a small keypoint-annotated dataset. We then
formulate a shape-aware adjustment problem that uses the learnt shape priors to
recover the 3D pose and shape of a query object from an image. For shape
representation and inference, we leverage recent successes of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) for the task of object and keypoint localization, and
train a novel cascaded fully-convolutional architecture to localize vehicle
\emph{keypoints} in images. The shape-aware adjustment then robustly recovers
shape (3D locations of the detected keypoints) while simultaneously filling in
occluded keypoints. To tackle estimation errors incurred due to erroneously
detected keypoints, we use an Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS)
scheme for robust optimization, and as a by-product characterize noise models
for each predicted keypoint. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving
benchmarks, and present superior results to existing monocular, as well as
stereo approaches.

 <dc:description>  To help mitigate road congestion, many transit authorities have implemented
managed lane policies. Managed lanes typically run parallel to a freeway's
standard, general-purpose (GP) lanes, but are restricted to certain types of
vehicles. It was originally thought that managed lanes would improve the use of
existing infrastructure through incentivization of demand-management behaviors
like carpooling, but implementations have often been characterized by
unpredicted phenomena that is often to detrimental system performance.
Development of traffic models that can capture these sorts of behaviors is a
key step for helping managed lanes deliver on their promised gains.
  Towards this goal, this paper presents several macroscopic traffic modeling
tools we have used for study of freeways equipped with managed lanes, or
&quot;managed lane-freeway networks.&quot; The proposed framework is based on the
widely-used first-order kinematic wave theory. In this model, the GP and the
managed lanes are modeled as parallel links connected by nodes, where certain
type of traffic may switch between GP and managed lane links. Two types of
managed lane configuration are considered: full-access, where vehicles can
switch between the GP and the managed lanes anywhere; and separated, where such
switching is allowed only at certain locations called gates. We incorporate two
empirically-observed phenomena into our model that are particular to managed
lane-freeway networks: the inertia effect and the friction effect.
  Calibration of models of large road networks is difficult, as the number of
parameters grow with the network's size. We present an iterative learning-based
approach to calibrating our model's physical and driver-behavioral parameters.
Finally, we validate our model and calibration methodology with case studies of
simulations of two managed lane-equipped California freeways.

can be used for classifier comparison using precision, accounting for
inter-precision correlation arising from use of same dataset. Comparisons are
made using per-class precision and methods presented to test global null

multi-class classifiers and to models using cross validation or its variants.
Partial Bayesian update to precision is introduced when population prevalence
of a class is known. Applications to compare deep architectures are studied.

 <dc:description>  Robot warehouse automation has attracted significant interest in recent
years, perhaps most visibly in the Amazon Picking Challenge (APC). A fully
autonomous warehouse pick-and-place system requires robust vision that reliably
recognizes and locates objects amid cluttered environments, self-occlusions,
sensor noise, and a large variety of objects. In this paper we present an
approach that leverages multi-view RGB-D data and self-supervised, data-driven
learning to overcome those difficulties. The approach was part of the
MIT-Princeton Team system that took 3rd- and 4th- place in the stowing and
picking tasks, respectively at APC 2016. In the proposed approach, we segment
and label multiple views of a scene with a fully convolutional neural network,
and then fit pre-scanned 3D object models to the resulting segmentation to get
the 6D object pose. Training a deep neural network for segmentation typically
requires a large amount of training data. We propose a self-supervised method
to generate a large labeled dataset without tedious manual segmentation. We
demonstrate that our system can reliably estimate the 6D pose of objects under
a variety of scenarios. All code, data, and benchmarks are available at

 <dc:description>  We study fast learning rates when the losses are not necessarily bounded and
may have a distribution with heavy tails. To enable such analyses, we introduce
two new conditions: (i) the envelope function $\sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}}|\ell
\circ f|$, where $\ell$ is the loss function and $\mathcal{F}$ is the
hypothesis class, exists and is $L^r$-integrable, and (ii) $\ell$ satisfies the
multi-scale Bernstein's condition on $\mathcal{F}$. Under these assumptions, we
prove that learning rate faster than $O(n^{-1/2})$ can be obtained and,
depending on $r$ and the multi-scale Bernstein's powers, can be arbitrarily
close to $O(n^{-1})$. We then verify these assumptions and derive fast learning
rates for the problem of vector quantization by $k$-means clustering with
heavy-tailed distributions. The analyses enable us to obtain novel learning
rates that extend and complement existing results in the literature from both
theoretical and practical viewpoints.

 <dc:title>Max-plus statistical leverage scores</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hook, James</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The statistical leverage scores of a complex matrix $A\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times
d}$ record the degree of alignment between col$(A)$ and the coordinate axes in
$\mathbb{C}^n$. These score are used in random sampling algorithms for solving
certain numerical linear algebra problems. In this paper we present a max-plus
algebraic analogue for statistical leverage scores. We show that max-plus
statistical leverage scores can be used to calculate the exact asymptotic
behavior of the conventional statistical leverage scores of a generic matrices
of Puiseux series and also provide a novel way to approximate the conventional
statistical leverage scores of a fixed or complex matrix. The advantage of
approximating a complex matrices scores with max-plus scores is that the
max-plus scores can be computed very quickly. This approximation is typically
accurate to within an order or magnitude and should be useful in practical
problems where the true scores are known to vary widely.

 <dc:title>Charged Point Normalization: An Efficient Solution to the Saddle Point

 <dc:creator>Aghajanyan, Armen</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, the problem of local minima in very high dimensional non-convex
optimization has been challenged and the problem of saddle points has been
introduced. This paper introduces a dynamic type of normalization that forces
the system to escape saddle points. Unlike other saddle point escaping
algorithms, second order information is not utilized, and the system can be
trained with an arbitrary gradient descent learner. The system drastically
improves learning in a range of deep neural networks on various data-sets in
comparison to non-CPN neural networks.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the structurally-constrained sparse decomposition of
multi-dimensional signals onto overcomplete families of vectors, called
dictionaries. The contribution of the paper is threefold. Firstly, a generic
spatio-temporal regularization term is designed and used together with the
standard $\ell_1$ regularization term to enforce a sparse decomposition
preserving the spatio-temporal structure of the signal. Secondly, an
optimization algorithm based on the split Bregman approach is proposed to
handle the associated optimization problem, and its convergence is analyzed.
Our well-founded approach yields same accuracy as the other algorithms at the
state-of-the-art, with significant gains in terms of convergence speed.
Thirdly, the empirical validation of the approach on artificial and real-world
problems demonstrates the generality and effectiveness of the method. On
artificial problems, the proposed regularization subsumes the Total Variation
minimization and recovers the expected decomposition. On the real-world problem
of electro-encephalography brainwave decomposition, the approach outperforms
similar approaches in terms of P300 evoked potentials detection, using
structured spatial priors to guide the decomposition.

 <dc:description>  We consider model social networks in which information propagates
directionally across layers of rational agents. Each agent makes a locally
optimal estimate of the state of the world, and communicates this estimate to
agents downstream. When agents receive information from the same source their
estimates are correlated. We show that the resulting redundancy can lead to the
loss of information about the state of the world across layers of the network,
even when all agents have full knowledge of the network's structure. A simple
algebraic condition identifies networks in which information loss occurs, and
we show that all such networks must contain a particular network motif. We also
study random networks asymptotically as the number of agents increases, and
find a sharp transition in the probability of information loss at the point at
which the number of agents in one layer exceeds the number in the previous
layer.

 <dc:description>  This paper aims to develop new and fast algorithms for recovering a sparse
vector from a small number of measurements, which is a fundamental problem in
the field of compressive sensing (CS). Currently, CS favors incoherent systems,
in which any two measurements are as little correlated as possible. In reality,
however, many problems are coherent, and conventional methods such as $L_1$
minimization do not work well. Recently, the difference of the $L_1$ and $L_2$
norms, denoted as $L_1$-$L_2$, is shown to have superior performance over the
classic $L_1$ method, but it is computationally expensive. We derive an
analytical solution for the proximal operator of the $L_1$-$L_2$ metric, and it
makes some fast $L_1$ solvers such as forward-backward splitting (FBS) and
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) applicable for $L_1$-$L_2$.
We describe in details how to incorporate the proximal operator into FBS and
ADMM and show that the resulting algorithms are convergent under mild
conditions. Both algorithms are shown to be much more efficient than the
original implementation of $L_1$-$L_2$ based on a difference-of-convex approach
in the numerical experiments.

 <dc:description>  The advantages of using communication networks to interconnect controllers
and physical plants motivate the increasing number of Networked Control
Systems, in industrial and critical infrastructure facilities. However, this
integration also exposes such control systems to new threats, typical of the
cyber domain. In this context, studies have been conduced, aiming to explore
vulnerabilities and propose security solutions for cyber-physical systems. In
this paper, it is proposed a covert attack for service degradation, which is
planned based on the intelligence gathered by another attack, herein proposed,
referred as System Identification attack. The simulation results demonstrate
that the joint operation of the two attacks is capable to affect, in a covert
and accurate way, the physical behavior of a system.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge Management (KM) is a relatively new phenomenon that appears in the
field of Public Sector Organizations (PSO) bringing new paradigms of
organizational management, challenges, risks and opportunities for its
implementation, development and evaluation. KM can be seen as a systematic and
deliberate effort to coordinate people, technology, organizational structures
and its environment through knowledge reuse and innovation. This management
approach has been established in parallel with the development and use of
information and communications technologies (ICT). Nowadays more PSO are
embodying KM practices in their core processes for support them, and as an
advanced management strategy to create a new culture based on technology and
resources efficiency. In this paper, we observed that KM can support
organizational goals in PSO. The aim of this paper is to understand KM factors
and its associated components, and propose KM metrics for measure KM programs
in PSO. Through a critical literature review we analysed diverse studies
related with KM performance indicators in PSO, then based on previous works we
summarized the more convenient this purpose. We found that, in academic
literature, studies about KM measurement in PSO are uncommon and emerging. As
well, in the last section of this paper, we present a proposal of KM metrics
for PSO, and some recommendations and practical implications for KM metrics
development in PSO. This academic endeavour seeks to contribute to theoretical
debate about KM measure development for KM initiatives in PSO.

 <dc:description>  We present a new method for identifying the latent categorization of items
based on their rankings. Complimenting a recent work that uses a Dirichlet
prior on preference vectors and variational inference, we show that this
problem can be effectively dealt with using existing community detection
algorithms, with the communities corresponding to item categories. In
particular we convert the bipartite ranking data to a unipartite graph of item
affinities, and apply community detection algorithms. In this context we modify
an existing algorithm - namely the label propagation algorithm to a variant
that uses the distance between the nodes for weighting the label propagation -
to identify the categories. We propose and analyze a synthetic ordinal ranking
model and show its relation to the recently much studied stochastic block
model. We test our algorithms on synthetic data and compare performance with
several popular community detection algorithms. We also test the method on real
data sets of movie categorization from the Movie Lens database. In all of the
cases our algorithm is able to identify the categories for a suitable choice of
tuning parameter.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes our submission to the 1st 3D Face Alignment in the Wild
(3DFAW) Challenge. Our method builds upon the idea of convolutional part
heatmap regression [1], extending it for 3D face alignment. Our method
decomposes the problem into two parts: (a) X,Y (2D) estimation and (b) Z
(depth) estimation. At the first stage, our method estimates the X,Y
coordinates of the facial landmarks by producing a set of 2D heatmaps, one for
each landmark, using convolutional part heatmap regression. Then, these
heatmaps, alongside the input RGB image, are used as input to a very deep
subnetwork trained via residual learning for regressing the Z coordinate. Our
method ranked 1st in the 3DFAW Challenge, surpassing the second best result by
more than 22%.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes models of learning process in teams of individuals who
collectively execute a sequence of tasks and whose actions are determined by
individual skill levels and networks of interpersonal appraisals and influence.
The closely-related proposed models have increasing complexity, starting with a
centralized manager-based assignment and learning model, and finishing with a
social model of interpersonal appraisal, assignments, learning, and influences.
We show how rational optimal behavior arises along the task sequence for each
model, and discuss conditions of suboptimality. Our models are grounded in
replicator dynamics from evolutionary games, influence networks from
mathematical sociology, and transactive memory systems from organization
science.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a class of propagation models for multiple competing
products over a social network. We consider two propagation mechanisms: social
conversion and self conversion, corresponding, respectively, to endogenous and
exogenous factors. A novel concept, the product-conversion graph, is proposed
to characterize the interplay among competing products. According to the
chronological order of social and self conversions, we develop two Markov-chain
models and, based on the independence approximation, we approximate them with
two respective difference equations systems.
  Theoretical analysis on these two approximation models reveals the dependency
of the systems' asymptotic behavior on the structures of both the
product-conversion graph and the social network, as well as the initial
condition. In addition to the theoretical work, accuracy of the independence
approximation and the asymptotic behavior of the Markov-chain model are
investigated via numerical analysis, for the case where social conversion
occurs before self conversion.
  Finally, we propose a class of multi-player and multi-stage competitive
propagation games and discuss the seeding-quality trade-off, as well as the
allocation of seeding resources among the individuals. We investigate the
unique Nash equilibrium at each stage and analyze the system's behavior when
every player is adopting the policy at the Nash equilibrium.

 <dc:title>Approximate Hierarchical Clustering via Sparsest Cut and Spreading
  Metrics</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Dasgupta recently introduced a cost function for the hierarchical clustering
of a set of points given pairwise similarities between them. He showed that
this function is NP-hard to optimize, but a top-down recursive partitioning
heuristic based on an alpha_n-approximation algorithm for uniform sparsest cut
gives an approximation of O(alpha_n log n) (the current best algorithm has
alpha_n=O(sqrt{log n})). We show that the aforementioned sparsest cut heuristic
in fact obtains an O(alpha_n)-approximation for hierarchical clustering. The
algorithm also applies to a generalized cost function studied by Dasgupta.
Moreover, we obtain a strong inapproximability result, showing that the
hierarchical clustering objective is hard to approximate to within any constant
factor assuming the Small-Set Expansion (SSE) Hypothesis. Finally, we discuss
approximation algorithms based on convex relaxations. We present a spreading
metric SDP relaxation for the problem and show that it has integrality gap at
most O(sqrt{log n}). The advantage of the SDP relative to the sparsest cut
heuristic is that it provides an explicit lower bound on the optimal solution
and could potentially yield an even better approximation for hierarchical
clustering. In fact our analysis of this SDP served as the inspiration for our
improved analysis of the sparsest cut heuristic. We also show that a spreading
metric LP relaxation gives an O(log n)-approximation.

 <dc:description>  Neural encoder-decoder models have shown great success in many sequence
generation tasks. However, previous work has not investigated situations in
which we would like to control the length of encoder-decoder outputs. This
capability is crucial for applications such as text summarization, in which we
have to generate concise summaries with a desired length. In this paper, we
propose methods for controlling the output sequence length for neural
encoder-decoder models: two decoding-based methods and two learning-based
methods. Results show that our learning-based methods have the capability to
control length without degrading summary quality in a summarization task.

 <dc:description>  Mean-squared-error (MSE) is one of the most widely used performance metrics
for the designs and analysis of multi-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
communications. Weighted MSE minimization, a more general formulation of MSE
minimization, plays an important role in MIMO transceiver optimization. While
this topic has a long history and has been extensively studied, existing
treatments on the methods in solving the weighted MSE optimization are more or
less sporadic and non-systematic. In this paper, we firstly review the two
major methodologies, Lagrange multiplier method and majorization theory based
method, and their common procedures in solving the weighted MSE minimization.
Then some problems and limitations of the methods that were usually neglected
or glossed over in existing literature are provided. These problems are
fundamental and of critical importance for the corresponding MIMO transceiver
optimizations. In addition, a new extended matrix-field weighted MSE model is
proposed. Its solutions and applications are discussed in details. Compared
with existing models, this new model has wider applications, e.g., nonlinear
MIMO transceiver designs and capacity-maximization transceiver designs for
general MIMO networks.

 <dc:description>  In areas such as computer software and hardware, manufacturing systems, and
transportation, engineers encounter networks with arbitrarily large numbers of
isomorphic subprocesses. Parameterized systems provide a framework for modeling
such networks. The analysis of parameterized systems is a challenge as some key
properties such as nonblocking and deadlock-freedom are undecidable even for
the case of a parameterized system with ring topology. In this paper, we
introduce \textit{Parameterized-Chain Networks} (PCN) for modeling of networks
containing several linear parameterized segments. Since deadlock analysis is
undecidable, to achieve a tractable subproblem we limit the behavior of
subprocesses of the network using our previously developed mathematical notion
`weak invariant simulation.' We develop a dependency graph for analysis of PCN
and show that partial and total deadlocks of the proposed PCN are characterized
by full, consistent subgraphs of the dependency graph. We investigate deadlock
in a traffic network as an illustrative example. This document contains all the
details and proofs of the study.

 <dc:description>  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a common type of Cybercrime. It can
strongly damage a company reputation and increase its costs. Attackers improve
continuously their strategies. They doubled the amount of unleashed
communication requests in volume, size, and frequency in the last few years.
This occurs against different hosts, causing resource exhaustion. Previous
studies focused on detecting or mitigating ongoing DDoS attacks. Yet,
addressing DDoS attacks when they are already in place may be too late. In this
article, we consider network resilience by early prediction of attack trends.
We show empirically the advantage of using non-parametric leading indicators
for early prediction of volumetric DDoS attacks. We report promising results
over a real dataset from CAIDA. Our results raise new questions and
opportunities for further research in early predicting trends of DDoS attacks.

 <dc:title>NP vs PSPACE</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present a proof of the conjecture $\mathcal{NP}$ = $\mathcal{PSPACE}$ by
showing that arbitrary tautologies of Johansson's minimal propositional logic
admit &quot;small&quot; polynomial-size dag-like natural deductions in Prawitz's system
for minimal propositional logic. These &quot;small&quot; deductions arise from standard
&quot;large&quot;\ tree-like inputs by horizontal dag-like compression that is obtained
by merging distinct nodes labeled with identical formulas occurring in
horizontal sections of deductions involved. The underlying &quot;geometric&quot; idea: if
the height, $h\left( \partial \right) $ , and the total number of distinct
formulas, $\phi \left( \partial \right) $ , of a given tree-like deduction
$\partial$ of a minimal tautology $\rho$ are both polynomial in the length of
$\rho$, $\left| \rho \right|$, then the size of the horizontal dag-like
compression is at most $h\left( \partial \right) \times \phi \left( \partial
\right) $, and hence polynomial in $\left| \rho \right|$. The attached proof is
due to the first author, but it was the second author who proposed an initial
idea to attack a weaker conjecture $\mathcal{NP}= \mathcal{\mathit{co}NP}$ by
reductions in diverse natural deduction formalisms for propositional logic.
That idea included interactive use of minimal, intuitionistic and classical
formalisms, so its practical implementation was too involved. The attached
proof of $ \mathcal{NP}=\mathcal{PSPACE}$ runs inside the natural deduction
interpretation of Hudelmaier's cutfree sequent calculus for minimal logic.

 <dc:description>  Many real-world machine learning applications involve several learning tasks
which are inter-related. For example, in healthcare domain, we need to learn a
predictive model of a certain disease for many hospitals. The models for each
hospital may be different because of the inherent differences in the
distributions of the patient populations. However, the models are also closely
related because of the nature of the learning tasks modeling the same disease.
By simultaneously learning all the tasks, multi-task learning (MTL) paradigm
performs inductive knowledge transfer among tasks to improve the generalization
performance. When datasets for the learning tasks are stored at different
locations, it may not always be feasible to transfer the data to provide a
data-centralized computing environment due to various practical issues such as
high data volume and privacy. In this paper, we propose a principled MTL
framework for distributed and asynchronous optimization to address the
aforementioned challenges. In our framework, gradient update does not wait for
collecting the gradient information from all the tasks. Therefore, the proposed
method is very efficient when the communication delay is too high for some task
nodes. We show that many regularized MTL formulations can benefit from this
framework, including the low-rank MTL for shared subspace learning. Empirical
studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency
and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

 <dc:description>  We study the spread of discrete-time epidemics over arbitrary networks for
well-known propagation models, namely SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible),
SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered), SIRS
(susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible) and SIV
(susceptible-infected-vaccinated). Such epidemics are described by $2^n$- or
$3^n$-state Markov chains. Ostensibly, because analyzing such Markov chains is
too complicated, their $O(n)$-dimensional nonlinear &quot;mean-field&quot; approximation,
and its linearization, are often studied instead. We provide a complete global
analysis of the epidemic dynamics of the nonlinear mean-field approximation. In
particular, we show that depending on the largest eigenvalue of the underlying
graph adjacency matrix and the rates of infection, recovery, and vaccination,
the global dynamics takes on one of two forms: either the epidemic dies out, or
it converges to another unique fixed point (the so-called endemic state where a
constant fraction of the nodes remain infected). A similar result has also been
shown in the continuous-time case. We tie in these results with the &quot;true&quot;
underlying Markov chain model by showing that the linear model is the tightest
upper-bound on the true probabilities of infection that involves only
marginals, and that, even though the nonlinear model is not an upper-bound on
the true probabilities in general, it does provide an upper-bound on the
probability of the chain not being absorbed. As a consequence, we also show
that when the disease-free fixed point is globally stable for the mean-field
model, the Markov chain has an $O(\log n)$ mixing time, which means the
epidemic dies out quickly. We compare and summarize the results on different
propagation models.

 <dc:description>  We propose an in-depth study of lending behaviors in Kiva using a mix of
quantitative and large-scale data mining techniques. Kiva is a non-profit
organization that offers an online platform to connect lenders with borrowers.
Their site, kiva.org, allows citizens to microlend small amounts of money to
entrepreneurs (borrowers) from different countries. The borrowers are always
affiliated with a Field Partner (FP) which can be a microfinance institution
(MFI) or other type of local organization that has partnered with Kiva. Field
partners give loans to selected businesses based on their local knowledge
regarding the country, the business sector including agriculture, health or
manufacture among others, and the borrower.Our objective is to understand the
relationship between lending activity and various features offered by the
online platform. Specifically, we focus on two research questions: (i) the role
that MFI ratings play in driving lending activity and (ii) the role that
various loan features have in the lending behavior. The first question analyzes
whether there exists a relationship between the MFI ratings - that lenders can
explore online - and their lending volumes. The second research question
attempts to understand if certain loan features - available online at Kiva -
such as the type of small business, the gender of the borrower, or the loan's
country information might affect the way lenders lend.

 <dc:description>  While the reversibility of multidimensional cellular automata is undecidable
and there exists a criterion for determining if a multidimensional linear
cellular automaton is reversible, there are only a few results about the
reversibility problem of multidimensional linear cellular automata under
boundary conditions. This work proposes a criterion for testing the
reversibility of a multidimensional linear cellular automaton under null
boundary condition and an algorithm for the computation of its reverse, if it
exists. The investigation of the dynamical behavior of a multidimensional
linear cellular automaton under null boundary condition is equivalent to
elucidating the properties of block Toeplitz matrix. The proposed criterion
significantly reduce the computational cost whenever the number of cells or the
dimension is large; the discussion can also apply to cellular automata under
periodic boundary condition with a minor modification.

 <dc:description>  Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is an important index for wireless
communications. There are many methods for increasing SNR. In CDMA systems,
spreading sequences are used. To increase SNR, we have to improve spreading
sequences. In classical approaches, the expression of SNR is not differentiable
in terms of the parameter of the spreading sequences even in no fading
situations. Thus, we express it as the differentiable form and construct the
non-linear programing for maximizing SNR. In particular, we solve the problem
of maximizing SNR numerically by obtaining spreading sequences whose SNR is
guaranteed to be high.

 <dc:description>  Motor imagery (MI) is a mental representation of motor behavior that has been
widely used as a control method for a brain-computer interface (BCI), allowing
communication for the physically impaired. The performance of MI based BCI
mainly depends on the subject's ability to self-modulate EEG signals. Proper
training can help naive subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently.
However, training subjects typically involves abstract motor tasks and is
time-consuming. To improve the performance of naive subjects during motor
imagery, a novel paradigm was presented that would guide naive subjects to
modulate brain activity effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures of the left
or right hand were used as cues for subjects to finish the motor imagery task.
Fourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22-25 years, mean 23.6+/-1.16)
participated in this study. The task was to imagine writing a Chinese
character. Specifically, subjects could imagine hand movements following the
sequence of writing strokes in the Chinese character. This paradigm was meant
to find an effective and familiar action for most Chinese people, to provide
them with a specific, extensively practiced task and help them modulate brain
activity. Results showed that the writing task paradigm yielded significantly
better performance than the traditional arrow paradigm (p&lt;0.001). Questionnaire
replies indicated that most subjects thought the new paradigm was easier and
more comfortable. The proposed new motor imagery paradigm could guide subjects
to help them modulate brain activity effectively. Results showed that there
were significant improvements using new paradigm, both in classification
accuracy and usability.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses lexicon word learning in high-dimensional meaning spaces
from the viewpoint of referential uncertainty. We investigate various
state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms and discuss the impact of scaling,
representation and meaning space structure. We demonstrate that current Machine
Learning techniques successfully deal with high-dimensional meaning spaces. In
particular, we show that exponentially increasing dimensions linearly impact
learner performance and that referential uncertainty from word sensitivity has
no impact.

 <dc:description>  &quot;People want an authority to tell them how to value things. But they chose
this authority not based on facts or results. They chose it because it seems
authoritative and familiar.&quot; - The Big Short
  The pavement condition index is one such a familiar measure used by many US
cities to measure street quality and justify billions of dollars spent every
year on street repair. These billion-dollar decisions are based on evaluation
criteria that are subjective and not representative. In this paper, we build
upon our initial submission to D4GX 2015 that approaches this problem of
information asymmetry in municipal decision-making.
  We describe a process to identify street-defects using computer vision
techniques on data collected using the Street Quality Identification Device
(SQUID). A User Interface to host a large quantity of image data towards
digitizing the street inspection process and enabling actionable intelligence
for a core public service is also described. This approach of combining device,
data and decision-making around street repair enables cities make targeted
decisions about street repair and could lead to an anticipatory response which
can result in significant cost savings. Lastly, we share lessons learnt from
the deployment of SQUID in the city of Syracuse, NY.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we derive simple closed-form expressions for the $n$-queens
problem and three related problems in terms of permanents of $(0,1)$ matrices.
These formulas are the first of their kind. Moreover, they provide the first
method for solving these problems with polynomial space that has a nontrivial
time complexity bound. We then show how a closed-form for the number of Latin
squares of order $n$ follows from our method. Finally, we prove lower bounds.
In particular, we show that the permanent of Schur's complex valued matrix is a
lower bound for the toroidal semi-queens problem, or equivalently, the number
of transversals in a cyclic Latin square.

 <dc:description>  We study event-triggered control for stabilization of unstable linear plants
over rate-limited communication channels subject to unknown, bounded delay. On
one hand, the timing of event triggering carries implicit information about the
state of the plant. On the other hand, the delay in the communication channel
causes information loss, as it makes the state information available at the
controller out of date. Combining these two effects, we show a phase transition
behavior in the transmission rate required for stabilization using a given
event-triggering strategy. For small values of the delay, the timing
information carried by the triggering events is substantial, and the system can
be stabilized with any positive rate. When the delay exceeds a critical
threshold, the timing information alone is not enough to achieve stabilization
and the required rate grows. When the loss of information due to the
communication delay perfectly compensates the implicit information carried by
the triggering events, the delay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the
plant, and we obtain the same rate requirement prescribed by the data-rate
theorem. When the delay is larger than this threshold, the required rate
becomes larger than that required by the data-rate theorem. We also provide an
explicit construction yielding a sufficient rate for stabilization, and
generalize our results to vector systems. The results do not rely on any a
priori probabilistic model of the delay or the initial conditions.

 <dc:description>  Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation refers to the process of retrieving the
direction information of several electromagnetic waves/sources from the outputs
of a number of receiving antennas that form a sensor array. DOA estimation is a
major problem in array signal processing and has wide applications in radar,
sonar, wireless communications, etc. With the development of sparse
representation and compressed sensing, the last decade has witnessed a
tremendous advance in this research topic. The purpose of this article is to
provide an overview of these sparse methods for DOA estimation, with a
particular highlight on the recently developed gridless sparse methods, e.g.,
those based on covariance fitting and the atomic norm. Several future research
directions are also discussed.

 <dc:description>  The trending integrations of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS, stationary
battery) and Electric Vehicles (EV, mobile battery) to distribution grids call
for advanced Demand Side Management (DSM) technique that addresses the
scalability concerns of the system and stochastic availabilities of EVs.
Towards this goal, a stochastic DSM is proposed to capture the uncertainties in
EVs. Numerical approximation is then used to make the problem tractable. To
accelerate the computational speed, the proposed DSM is tightly relaxed to a
convex form using second-order cone programming. Furthermore, in light of the
continuous increasing problem size, a distributed method with a guaranteed
convergence is applied to shift the centralized computational burden to
distributed controllers. To verify the proposed DSM, real-life EV data
collected on UCLA campus is used to test the proposed DSM in an IEEE benchmark
test system. Numerical results demonstrate the correctness and merits of the
proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Management and analysis of big data are systematically associated with a data
distributed architecture in the Hadoop and now Spark frameworks. This article
offers an introduction for statisticians to these technologies by comparing the
performance obtained by the direct use of three reference environments: R,
Python Scikit-learn, Spark MLlib on three public use cases: character
recognition, recommending films, categorizing products. As main result, it
appears that, if Spark is very efficient for data munging and recommendation by
collaborative filtering (non-negative factorization), current implementations
of conventional learning methods (logistic regression, random forests) in MLlib
or SparkML do not ou poorly compete habitual use of these methods (R, Python
Scikit-learn) in an integrated or undistributed architecture

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a CNN cascade for semantic part segmentation guided by
pose-specific information encoded in terms of a set of landmarks (or
keypoints). There is large amount of prior work on each of these tasks
separately, yet, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in
literature that the interplay between pose estimation and semantic part
segmentation is investigated. To address this limitation of prior work, in this
paper, we propose a CNN cascade of tasks that firstly performs landmark
localisation and then uses this information as input for guiding semantic part
segmentation. We applied our architecture to the problem of facial part
segmentation and report large performance improvement over the standard
unguided network on the most challenging face datasets. Testing code and models
will be published online at http://cs.nott.ac.uk/~psxasj/.

 <dc:title>A Near-Quadratic Lower Bound for the Size of Quantum Circuits of
  Constant Treewidth</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Oliveira, Mateus de Oliveira</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show that any quantum circuit of treewidth $t$, built from $r$-qubit
gates, requires at least $\Omega(\frac{n^{2}}{2^{O(r\cdot t)}\cdot \log^4 n})$
gates to compute the element distinctness function. Our result generalizes a
near-quadratic lower bound for quantum formula size obtained by Roychowdhury
and Vatan [SIAM J. on Computing, 2001]. The proof of our lower bound follows by
an extension of Ne\v{c}iporuk's method to the context of quantum circuits of
constant treewidth. This extension is made via a combination of techniques from
structural graph theory, tensor-network theory, and the connected-component
counting method, which is a classic tool in algebraic geometry.

 <dc:description>  Efficient construction of the suffix tree given an input text is an active
area of research from the time it was first introduced. Both theoretical
computer scientists and engineers tackled the problem. In this paper we focus
on the fastest practical suffix tree construction algorithm to date, ERA. We
first provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm assuming the uniformly
random text as an input and using the PEM model of computation with respect to
the lower bounds. Secondly, we empirically confirm the theoretical results in
different test scenarios exposing the critical terms. Thirdly, we discuss the
fundamental characteristics of the input text where the fastest suffix tree
construction algorithms in practice fail. This paper serves as a foundation for
further research in the parallel text indexing area.

 <dc:title>Automated Enterprise Applications Generation from Requirement Model</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Notwithstanding the advancement of software engineering for enterprise
applications, the process of software implementation is still time-consuming
and error-prone. This situation is more severe when developing the custom
software, because the requirements are always changing during the whole
development processes. This issue could be alleviated by reusing exiting code
or services in the private and public repositories. Nevertheless, the reuse
could fail if no existing service is matched or existing services could not be
composited to satisfy the requirements. Eventually, the developers have to
implement the business logic manually for the un-satisfied requirements. In
this paper, we present an approach which can automated generate business logic
from requirement model for enterprise applications. Unlike other works, our
approach does not need to specify design model such as sequence diagram, the
business logic could be directly generated from operation contracts of
requirement model. Operation contracts only contain the preconditions before
executing the action, and the postconditions after execution. Moreover, the
generated off-the-shelf code is adopted the same multi-layer structure as Java
EE and .NET platforms which are robust, scalable, and widely used in enterprise
application developments. Finally, a case study of library management system
demonstrates the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach in our
implemented RMCode tool.

 <dc:description>  This paper begins with considering the identification of sparse linear
time-invariant networks described by multivariable ARX models. Such models
possess relatively simple structure thus used as a benchmark to promote further
research. With identifiability of the network guaranteed, this paper presents
an identification method that infers both the Boolean structure of the network
and the internal dynamics between nodes. Identification is performed directly
from data without any prior knowledge of the system, including its order. The
proposed method solves the identification problem using Maximum a posteriori
estimation (MAP) but with inseparable penalties for complexity, both in terms
of element (order of nonzero connections) and group sparsity (network
topology). Such an approach is widely applied in Compressive Sensing (CS) and
known as Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL). We then propose a novel scheme that
combines sparse Bayesian and group sparse Bayesian to efficiently solve the
problem. The resulted algorithm has a similar form of the standard Sparse Group
Lasso (SGL) while with known noise variance, it simplifies to exact re-weighted
SGL. The method and the developed toolbox can be applied to infer networks from
a wide range of fields, including systems biology applications such as
signaling and genetic regulatory networks.

 <dc:description>  Filter bank-based multicarrier (FBMC) systems are currently being considered
as a prevalent candidate for replacing the long established cyclic prefix
(CP)-based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CP-OFDM) in the physical
layer of next generation communications systems. In particular, FBMC/OQAM has
received increasing attention due to, among other features, its potential for
maximum spectral efficiency. It suffers, however, from an intrinsic
self-interference effect, which complicates signal processing tasks at the
receiver, including synchronization, channel estimation and equalization. In a
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configuration, the multi-antenna
interference has also to be taken into account. (Semi-)blind FBMC/OQAM
receivers have been little studied so far and mainly for single-antenna
systems. The problem of joint channel estimation and data detection in a
MIMO-FBMC/OQAM system, given limited or no training information, is studied in
this paper through a tensor-based approach in the light of the success of such
techniques in OFDM applications. Simulation-based comparisons with CP-OFDM are
included, for realistic transmission models.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained significant traction in the
field of machine learning, particularly due to their high accuracy in visual
recognition. Recent works have pushed the performance of GPU implementations of
CNNs to significantly improve their classification and training times. With
these improvements, many frameworks have become available for implementing CNNs
on both CPUs and GPUs, with no support for FPGA implementations. In this work
we present a modified version of the popular CNN framework Caffe, with FPGA
support. This allows for classification using CNN models and specialized FPGA
implementations with the flexibility of reprogramming the device when
necessary, seamless memory transactions between host and device, simple-to-use
test benches, and the ability to create pipelined layer implementations. To
validate the framework, we use the Xilinx SDAccel environment to implement an
FPGA-based Winograd convolution engine and show that the FPGA layer can be used
alongside other layers running on a host processor to run several popular CNNs
(AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG A, Overfeat). The results show that our framework
achieves 50 GFLOPS across 3x3 convolutions in the benchmarks. This is achieved
within a practical framework, which will aid in future development of
FPGA-based CNNs.

 <dc:title>Algebraic and logical descriptions of generalized trees</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Courcelle, Bruno</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Quasi-trees generalize trees in that the unique &quot;path&quot; between two nodes may
be infinite and have any countable order type. They are used to define the
rank-width of a countable graph in such a way that it is equal to the least
upper-bound of the rank-widths of its finite induced subgraphs. Join-trees are
the corresponding directed trees. They are useful to define the modular
decomposition of a countable graph. We also consider ordered join-trees, that
generalize rooted trees equipped with a linear order on the set of sons of each
node. We define algebras with finitely many operations that generate (via
infinite terms) these generalized trees. We prove that the associated regular
objects (those defined by regular terms) are exactly the ones that are the
unique models of monadic second-order sentences. These results use and
generalize a similar result by W. Thomas for countable linear orders.

 <dc:description>  The objective of this dissertation is to shed light on some fundamental
impediments in learning control laws in continuous state spaces. In particular,
if one wants to build artificial devices capable to learn motor tasks the same
way they learn to classify signals and images, one needs to establish control
rules that do not necessitate comparisons between quantities of the surrounding
space. We propose, in that context, to take inspiration from the &quot;end effector
control&quot; principle, as suggested by neuroscience studies, as opposed to the
&quot;displacement control&quot; principle used in the classical control theory.

 <dc:title>Soft Cache Hits and the Impact of Alternative Content Recommendations on

 <dc:description>  Caching popular content at the edge of future mobile networks has been widely
considered in order to alleviate the impact of the data tsunami on both the
access and backhaul networks. A number of interesting techniques have been
proposed, including femto-caching and &quot;delayed&quot; or opportunistic cache access.
Nevertheless, the majority of these approaches suffer from the rather limited
storage capacity of the edge caches, compared to the tremendous and rapidly
increasing size of the Internet content catalog. We propose to depart from the
assumption of hard cache misses, common in most existing works, and consider
&quot;soft&quot; cache misses, where if the original content is not available, an
alternative content that is locally cached can be recommended. Given that
Internet content consumption is increasingly entertainment-oriented, we believe
that a related content could often lead to complete or at least partial user
satisfaction, without the need to retrieve the original content over expensive
links. In this paper, we formulate the problem of optimal edge caching with
soft cache hits, in the context of delayed access, and analyze the expected
gains. We then show using synthetic and real datasets of related video contents
that promising caching gains could be achieved in practice.

 <dc:description>  Emerging cellular technologies such as those proposed for use in 5G
communications will accommodate a wide range of usage scenarios with diverse
link requirements. This will include the necessity to operate over a versatile
set of wireless channels ranging from indoor to outdoor, from line-of-sight
(LOS) to non-LOS, and from circularly symmetric scattering to environments
which promote the clustering of scattered multipath waves. Unfortunately, many
of the conventional fading models adopted in the literature to develop network
models lack the flexibility to account for such disparate signal propagation
mechanisms. To bridge the gap between theory and practical channels, we
consider $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading, which contains as special cases, the
majority of the linear fading models proposed in the open literature, including
Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-m, Nakagami-q, One-sided Gaussian, $\kappa$-$\mu$,
$\eta$-$\mu$, and Rician shadowed to name but a few. In particular, we apply an
orthogonal expansion to represent the $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading
distribution as a simplified series expression. Then using the series
expressions with stochastic geometry, we propose an analytic framework to
evaluate the average of an arbitrary function of the SINR over $\kappa$-$\mu$
shadowed fading channels. Using the proposed method, we evaluate the spectral
efficiency, moments of the SINR, bit error probability and outage probability
of a $K$-tier HetNet with $K$ classes of BSs, differing in terms of the
transmit power, BS density, shadowing characteristics and small-scale fading.
Building upon these results, we provide important new insights into the network
performance of these emerging wireless applications while considering a diverse
range of fading conditions and link qualities.

 <dc:description>  We propose an entirely data-driven approach to estimating the 3D pose of a
hand given a depth image. We show that we can correct the mistakes made by a
Convolutional Neural Network trained to predict an estimate of the 3D pose by
using a feedback loop. The components of this feedback loop are also Deep
Networks, optimized using training data. They remove the need for fitting a 3D
model to the input data, which requires both a carefully designed fitting
function and algorithm. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, and is efficient as our implementation runs at over 400 fps on a
single GPU.

 <dc:title>Type checking through unification</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe how to leverage higher-order unification to type
check a dependently typed language with meta-variables. The literature usually
presents the unification algorithm as a standalone component, however the need
to check definitional equality of terms while type checking gives rise to a
tight interplay between type checking and unification. This interplay is a
major source of complexity in the type-checking algorithm for existing
dependently typed programming languages. We propose an algorithm that encodes a
type-checking problem entirely in the form of unification constraints, reducing
the complexity of the type-checking code by taking advantage of higher order
unification, which is already part of the implementation of many dependently
typed languages.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on large scale RGB databases
have become the secret sauce in the majority of recent approaches for object
categorization from RGB-D data. Thanks to colorization techniques, these
methods exploit the filters learned from 2D images to extract meaningful
representations in 2.5D. Still, the perceptual signature of these two kind of
images is very different, with the first usually strongly characterized by
textures, and the second mostly by silhouettes of objects. Ideally, one would
like to have two CNNs, one for RGB and one for depth, each trained on a
suitable data collection, able to capture the perceptual properties of each
channel for the task at hand. This has not been possible so far, due to the
lack of a suitable depth database. This paper addresses this issue, proposing
to opt for synthetically generated images rather than collecting by hand a 2.5D
large scale database. While being clearly a proxy for real data, synthetic
images allow to trade quality for quantity, making it possible to generate a
virtually infinite amount of data. We show that the filters learned from such
data collection, using the very same architecture typically used on visual
data, learns very different filters, resulting in depth features (a) able to
better characterize the different facets of depth images, and (b) complementary
with respect to those derived from CNNs pre-trained on 2D datasets. Experiments
on two publicly available databases show the power of our approach.

 <dc:description>  The paper presents a proof of concept to calibrate iCub's skin using vacuum
bags. The method's main idea consists in inserting the skin in a vacuum bag,
and then decreasing the pressure in the bag to create a uniform pressure
distribution on the skin surface. Acquisition and data processing of the bag
pressure and sensors' measured capacitance allow us to characterize the
relationship between the pressure and the measured capacitance of each sensor.
After calibration, integration of the pressure distribution over the skin
geometry provides us with the net normal force applied to the skin. Experiments
are conducted using the forearm skin of the iCub humanoid robot, and validation
results indicate acceptable average errors in force prediction.

 <dc:description>  Rate adaptation in 802.11 WLANs has received a lot of attention from the
research community, with most of the proposals aiming at maximising throughput
based on network conditions. Considering energy consumption, an implicit
assumption is that optimality in throughput implies optimality in energy
efficiency, but this assumption has been recently put into question. In this
paper, we address via analysis and experimentation the relation between
throughput performance and energy efficiency in multi-rate 802.11 scenarios. We
demonstrate the trade-off between these performance figures, confirming that
they may not be simultaneously optimised, and analyse their sensitivity towards
the energy consumption parameters of the device. Our results provide the means
to design novel rate adaptation schemes that takes energy consumption into
account.

 <dc:description>  Bounded context switching (BCS) is an under-approximate method for finding
violations to safety properties in shared memory concurrent programs.
Technically, BCS is a reachability problem that is known to be NP-complete. Our
contribution is a parameterized analysis of BCS.
  The first result is an algorithm that solves BCS when parameterized by the
number of context switches (cs) and the size of the memory (m) in
O*(m^(cs)2^(cs)). This is achieved by creating instances of the easier problem
Shuff which we solve via fast subset convolution. We also present a lower bound
for BCS of the form m^o(cs / log(cs)), based on the exponential time
hypothesis. Interestingly, closing the gap means settling a conjecture that has
been open since FOCS'07. Further, we prove that BCS admits no polynomial
kernel.
  Next, we introduce a measure, called scheduling dimension, that captures the
complexity of schedules. We study BCS parameterized by the scheduling dimension
(sdim) and show that it can be solved in O*((2m)^(4sdim)4^t)$, where t is the
number of threads. We consider variants of the problem for which we obtain
(matching) upper and lower bounds.

 <dc:title>Rectified binaural ratio: A complex T-distributed feature for robust

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Applications</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Most existing methods in binaural sound source localization rely on some kind
of aggregation of phase-and level-difference cues in the time-frequency plane.
While different ag-gregation schemes exist, they are often heuristic and suffer
in adverse noise conditions. In this paper, we introduce the rectified binaural
ratio as a new feature for sound source local-ization. We show that for
Gaussian-process point source signals corrupted by stationary Gaussian noise,
this ratio follows a complex t-distribution with explicit parameters. This new
formulation provides a principled and statistically sound way to aggregate
binaural features in the presence of noise. We subsequently derive two simple
and efficient methods for robust relative transfer function and time-delay
estimation. Experiments on heavily corrupted simulated and speech signals
demonstrate the robustness of the proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of estimating the phases of K mixed complex signals
from a multichannel observation, when the mixing matrix and signal magnitudes
are known. This problem can be cast as a non-convex quadratically constrained
quadratic program which is known to be NP-hard in general. We propose three
approaches to tackle it: a heuristic method, an alternate minimization method,
and a convex relaxation into a semi-definite program. The last two approaches
are showed to outperform the oracle multichannel Wiener filter in
under-determined informed source separation tasks, using simulated and speech
signals. The convex relaxation approach yields best results, including the
potential for exact source separation in under-determined settings.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new framework for supervised sound source
localization referred to as virtually-supervised learning. An acoustic shoe-box
room simulator is used to generate a large number of binaural single-source
audio scenes. These scenes are used to build a dataset of spatial binaural
features annotated with acoustic properties such as the 3D source position and
the walls' absorption coefficients. A probabilistic high- to low-dimensional
regression framework is used to learn a mapping from these features to the
acoustic properties. Results indicate that this mapping successfully estimates
the azimuth and elevation of new sources, but also their range and even the
walls' absorption coefficients solely based on binaural signals. Results also
reveal that incorporating random-diffusion effects in the data significantly
improves the estimation of all parameters.

 <dc:description>  Crowdsourcing platforms enable to propose simple human intelligence tasks to
a large number of participants who realise these tasks. The workers often
receive a small amount of money or the platforms include some other incentive
mechanisms, for example they can increase the workers reputation score, if they
complete the tasks correctly. We address the problem of identifying experts
among participants, that is, workers, who tend to answer the questions
correctly. Knowing who are the reliable workers could improve the quality of
knowledge one can extract from responses. As opposed to other works in the
literature, we assume that participants can give partial or incomplete
responses, in case they are not sure that their answers are correct. We model
such partial or incomplete responses with the help of belief functions, and we
derive a measure that characterizes the expertise level of each participant.
This measure is based on precise and exactitude degrees that represent two
parts of the expertise level. The precision degree reflects the reliability
level of the participants and the exactitude degree reflects the knowledge
level of the participants. We also analyze our model through simulation and
demonstrate that our richer model can lead to more reliable identification of
experts.

 <dc:description>  Individual neighborhoods within large cities can benefit from independent
analysis of public data in the context of ongoing efforts to improve the
community. Yet existing tools for public data analysis and visualization are
often mismatched to community needs, for reasons including geographic
granularity that does not correspond to community boundaries, siloed data sets,
inaccurate assumptions about data literacy, and limited user input in design
and implementation phases. In Atlanta this need is being addressed through a
Data Dashboard developed under the auspices of the Westside Communities
Alliance (WCA), a partnership between Georgia Tech and community stakeholders.
In this paper we present an interactive analytic and visualization tool for
public safety data within the WCA Data Dashboard. We describe a human-centered
approach to understand the needs of users and to build accessible mapping tools
for visualization and analysis. The tools include a variety of overlays that
allow users to spatially correlate features of the built environment, such as
vacant properties with criminal activity as well as crime prevention efforts.
We are in the final stages of developing the first version of the tool, with
plans for a public release in fall of 2016.

 <dc:description>  The American Community Survey (ACS) is the bedrock underpinning any analysis
of the US population, urban areas included. The Census Bureau delivers the ACS
data in multiple formats, yet in each the raw data is difficult to export in
bulk and difficult to sift through. We argue that Enigma's approach to the data
delivery, such as our raw data and metadata presentation, reflects the survey's
logical structure. It can be explored, interlinked, and searched; making it
easier to retrieve the appropriate data applicable to a question at hand. We
make the use of data more liquid via curated tables and API access; even
metadata and notes from technical documentation are programmatically
accessible. Additionally, we are working towards opening our scalable and
reproducible ingestion process of ACS estimations. This paper details all of
the ways the Census Bureau currently makes the data available, the barriers
each of these raise to applying this data in analysis and how our approach
overcomes them. Finally, this paper will address other recent innovations in
making Census datasets more usable, the use cases suited to each and how they
fit into the wider application of data science.

 <dc:description>  In this article algebraic constructions are introduced in order to study the
variety defined by a radical parametrization (a tuple of functions involving
complex numbers, $n$ variables, the four field operations and radical
extractions). We provide algorithms to implicitize radical parametrizations and
to check whether a radical parametrization can be reparametrized into a
rational parametrization.

 <dc:title>Detecting Cognitive Appraisals from Facial Expressions for Interest
  Recognition</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Soleymani, Mohammad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Interest makes one hold her attention on the object of interest. Automatic
recognition of interest has numerous applications in human-computer
interaction. In this paper, we study the facial expressions associated with
interest and its underlying and closely related components, namely, curiosity,
coping potential, novelty and complexity. To this end, we conducted an
experiment in which participants watched images and micro-videos while a
front-facing camera recorded their expressions. After watching each item they
self-reported their level of interest, curiosity, coping potential and
perceived novelty and complexity. Using an automated method, we tracked facial
action units (AU) and studied the relationship between the presence of facial
movements with interest and its related components. We then tracked the facial
landmarks, e.g., corners of lips, and extracted features from each response. We
trained random forests regression models to detect the level of interest,
curiosity, and appraisals. We found a large difference between the way people
report and react to interesting visual content. The expressions in response to
images and micro-videos were not always pronounced depending on the
participants. This makes the direct detection of interest from facial
expressions a challenging problem. With this work, for the first time, we
demonstrate the feasibility of detecting cognitive appraisals from facial
expressions which will open the door for appraisal-driven emotion recognition
methods.

 <dc:title>Adaptive dictionary based approach for background noise and speaker
  classification and subsequent source separation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Girish, K V Vijay</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A judicious combination of dictionary learning methods, block sparsity and
source recovery algorithm are used in a hierarchical manner to identify the
noises and the speakers from a noisy conversation between two people.
Conversations are simulated using speech from two speakers, each with a
different background noise, with varied SNR values, down to -10 dB. Ten each of
randomly chosen male and female speakers from the TIMIT database and all the
noise sources from the NOISEX database are used for the simulations. For
speaker identification, the relative value of weights recovered is used to
select an appropriately small subset of the test data, assumed to contain
speech. This novel choice of using varied amounts of test data results in an
improvement in the speaker recognition rate of around 15% at SNR of 0 dB.
Speech and noise are separated using dictionaries of the estimated speaker and
noise, and an improvement of signal to distortion ratios of up to 10% is
achieved at SNR of 0 dB. K-medoid and cosine similarity based dictionary
learning methods lead to better recognition of the background noise and the
speaker. Experiments are also conducted on cases, where either the background
noise or the speaker is outside the set of trained dictionaries. In such cases,
adaptive dictionary learning leads to performance comparable to the other case
of complete dictionaries.

 <dc:description>  Medical research is one area where collecting data is usually hard and
expensive. With the launch of ResearchKit, Apple and Sage Bionetworks made
large-scale personal data collection increasingly popular via simple text-based
survey apps running on mobile phones. But such surveys can be a barrier in
terms of usability and richness of the data being collected. In this paper, we
present SDL-R X , a powerful software library designed for ResearchKit that
enables study-specific, personalized, and rich visual surveys, for both iOS and

 <dc:description>  The stringent requirements of a 1,000 times increase in data traffic and one
millisecond round trip latency have made limiting the potentially tremendous
ensuing energy consumption one of the most challenging problems for the design
of the upcoming fifth-generation (5G) networks. To enable sustainable 5G
networks, new technologies have been proposed to improve the system energy
efficiency and alternative energy sources are introduced to reduce our
dependence on traditional fossil fuels. In particular, various 5G techniques
target the reduction of the energy consumption without sacrificing the
quality-of-service. Meanwhile, energy harvesting technologies, which enable
communication transceivers to harvest energy from various renewable resources
and ambient radio frequency signals for communi- cation, have drawn significant
interest from both academia and industry. In this article, we provide an
overview of the latest research on both green 5G techniques and energy
harvesting for communication. In addition, some technical challenges and
potential research topics for realizing sustainable green 5G networks are also
identified.

 <dc:description>  In this invited talk, I will review five basic concepts of Axiomatic
Rewriting Theory, an axiomatic and diagrammatic theory of rewriting started 25
years ago in a LICS paper with Georges Gonthier and Jean-Jacques L\'evy, and
developed along the subsequent years into a full-fledged 2-dimensional theory
of causality and residuation in rewriting. I will give a contemporary view on
the theory, informed by my later work on categorical semantics and
higher-dimensional algebra, and also indicate a number of current research

 <dc:title>Real-time Predictive Analytics for Improving Public Transportation

 <dc:description>  Public transit systems are a critical component of major metropolitan areas.
However, in the face of increasing demand, most of these systems are operating
close to capacity. Under normal operating conditions, station crowding and
boarding denial are becoming a major concern for transit agencies. As such, any
disruption in service will have even more severe consequences, affecting huge
number of passengers. Considering the aging infrastructure of many large
cities, such as New York and London, these disruptions are to be expected,
amplifying the need for better demand management and strategies to deal with
congested transit facilities. Opportunistic sensors such as smart cards (AFC),
automatic vehicle location systems (AVL), GPS, etc. provide a wealth of
information about system's performance and passengers' trip making patterns. We
develop a hybrid data/model-driven decision support system, using real-time
predictive models, to help transit operators manage and respond proactively to
disruptions and mitigate consequences in a timely fashion. These models include
station arrival and origin-destination predictions in real-time to help transit
agencies, and predictive information systems for assisting passengers' trip
making decisions.

 <dc:title>Bit-permuted coded modulation for polar codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tavildar, Saurabha R</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of using polar codes with higher order modulation
over AWGN channels. Unlike prior work, we focus on using modulation independent
polar codes. That is, the polar codes are not re-designed based on the
modulation used. Instead, we propose bit-permuted coded modulation (BPCM): a
technique for using the multilevel coding (MLC) approach for an arbitrary polar
code. The BPCM technique exploits a natural connection between MLC and polar
codes. It involves applying bit permutations prior to mapping the polar code to
a higher order modulation. The bit permutations are designed, via density
evolution, to match the rates provided by various bit levels of the higher
order modulation to that of the polar code.
  We demonstrate performance of the BPCM technique using link simulations and
density evolution for the AWGN channel. We compare the BPCM technique with the
bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) technique. When using polar codes
designed for BPSK modulation, we show gains for BPCM over BICM with random
interleaver of up to 0.2 dB, 0.7 dB and 1.4 dB for 4-ASK, 8-ASK, and 16-ASK
respectively.

 <dc:title>Identification of Piecewise Affine State-Space Models via Expectation
  Maximization</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the identification of piecewise affine state-space
models. These models are obtained by partitioning the state or input domain
into a finite number of regions and by considering affine submodels in each
region. The proposed framework uses the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm
to identify the parameters of the model. In most of the current literature, a
discrete random variable with a discrete transition density is introduced to
describe the transition between each submodel, leading to a further
approximation of the dynamical system by a jump Markov model. On the contrary,
we use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) to compute the probability of
each submodel given the measurement at that time step. Then, given the submodel
at each time step the latent state is estimated using the Kalman smoother.
Subsequently, the parameters are estimated by maximizing a surrogate function
for the likelihood. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated using
the simulated model of the JAS 39 Gripen aircraft.

 <dc:description>  In the classical Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), the objective function
sums the costs for travelling from one city to the next city along the tour. In
the q-stripe TSP with q larger than 1, the objective function sums the costs
for travelling from one city to each of the next q cities along the tour. The
resulting q-stripe TSP generalizes the TSP and forms a special case of the
quadratic assignment problem. We analyze the computational complexity of the
q-stripe TSP for various classes of specially structured distance matrices. We
derive NP-hardness results as well as polyomially solvable cases. One of our
main results generalizes a well-known theorem of Kalmanson from the classical
TSP to the q-stripe TSP.

 <dc:description>  Many spectral unmixing methods rely on the non-negative decomposition of
spectral data onto a dictionary of spectral templates. In particular,
state-of-the-art music transcription systems decompose the spectrogram of the
input signal onto a dictionary of representative note spectra. The typical
measures of fit used to quantify the adequacy of the decomposition compare the
data and template entries frequency-wise. As such, small displacements of
energy from a frequency bin to another as well as variations of timber can
disproportionally harm the fit. We address these issues by means of optimal
transportation and propose a new measure of fit that treats the frequency
distributions of energy holistically as opposed to frequency-wise. Building on
the harmonic nature of sound, the new measure is invariant to shifts of energy
to harmonically-related frequencies, as well as to small and local
displacements of energy. Equipped with this new measure of fit, the dictionary
of note templates can be considerably simplified to a set of Dirac vectors
located at the target fundamental frequencies (musical pitch values). This in
turns gives ground to a very fast and simple decomposition algorithm that
achieves state-of-the-art performance on real musical data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a method for stabilizing biped robots stepping by a
combination of Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) tracking and step adjustment
is proposed. In this method, the DCM trajectory is generated, consistent with
the predefined footprints. Furthermore, a swing foot trajectory modification
strategy is proposed to adapt the landing point, using DCM measurement. In
order to apply the generated trajectories to the full robot, a Hierarchical
Inverse Dynamics (HID) is employed. The HID enables us to use different
combinations of the DCM tracking and step adjustment for stabilizing different
biped robots. Simulation experiments on two scenarios for two different
simulated robots, one with active ankles and the other with passive ankles, are
carried out. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method for robots with both active and passive ankles.

 <dc:title>On the Worst-case Communication Overhead for Distributed Data Shuffling</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Distributed learning platforms for processing large scale data-sets are
becoming increasingly prevalent. In typical distributed implementations, a
centralized master node breaks the data-set into smaller batches for parallel
processing across distributed workers to achieve speed-up and efficiency.
Several computational tasks are of sequential nature, and involve multiple
passes over the data. At each iteration over the data, it is common practice to
randomly re-shuffle the data at the master node, assigning different batches
for each worker to process. This random re-shuffling operation comes at the
cost of extra communication overhead, since at each shuffle, new data points
need to be delivered to the distributed workers.
  In this paper, we focus on characterizing the information theoretically
optimal communication overhead for the distributed data shuffling problem. We
propose a novel coded data delivery scheme for the case of no excess storage,
where every worker can only store the assigned data batches under processing.
Our scheme exploits a new type of coding opportunity and is applicable to any
arbitrary shuffle, and for any number of workers. We also present an
information theoretic lower bound on the minimum communication overhead for
data shuffling, and show that the proposed scheme matches this lower bound for
the worst-case communication overhead.

 <dc:description>  Modern distributed storage systems often use erasure codes to protect against
disk and node failures to increase reliability, while trying to meet the
latency requirements of the applications and clients. Storage systems may have
caches at the proxy or client ends in order to reduce the latency. In this
paper, we consider a novel caching framework with erasure code called
functional caching. Functional Caching involves using erasure-coded chunks in
the cache such that the code formed by the chunks in storage nodes and cache
combined are maximal-distance-separable (MDS) erasure codes. Based on the
arrival rates of different files, placement of file chunks on the servers, and
service time distribution of storage servers, an optimal functional caching
placement and the access probabilities of the file request from different disks
are considered. The proposed algorithm gives significant latency improvement in
both simulations and a prototyped solution in an open-source, cloud storage
deployment.

 <dc:title>Regular and almost universal hashing: an efficient implementation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Random hashing can provide guarantees regarding the performance of data
structures such as hash tables---even in an adversarial setting. Many existing
families of hash functions are universal: given two data objects, the
probability that they have the same hash value is low given that we pick hash
functions at random. However, universality fails to ensure that all hash
functions are well behaved. We further require regularity: when picking data
objects at random they should have a low probability of having the same hash
value, for any fixed hash function. We present the efficient implementation of
a family of non-cryptographic hash functions (PM+) offering good running times,
good memory usage as well as distinguishing theoretical guarantees: almost
universality and component-wise regularity. On a variety of platforms, our
implementations are comparable to the state of the art in performance. On
recent Intel processors, PM+ achieves a speed of 4.7 bytes per cycle for 32-bit
outputs and 3.3 bytes per cycle for 64-bit outputs. We review vectorization
through SIMD instructions (e.g., AVX2) and optimizations for superscalar
execution.

 <dc:description>  The Hermite methods of Goodrich, Hagstrom, and Lorenz (2006) use Hermite
interpolation to construct high order numerical methods for hyperbolic initial
value problems. The structure of the method has several favorable features for
parallel computing. In this work, we propose algorithms that take advantage of
the many-core architecture of Graphics Processing Units. The algorithm exploits
the compact stencil of Hermite methods and uses data structures that allow for
efficient data load and stores. Additionally the highly localized evolution
operator of Hermite methods allows us to combine multi-stage time-stepping
methods within the new algorithms incurring minimal accesses of global memory.
Using a scalar linear wave equation, we study the algorithm by considering
Hermite interpolation and evolution as individual kernels and alternatively
combined them into a monolithic kernel. For both approaches we demonstrate
strategies to increase performance. Our numerical experiments show that
although a two kernel approach allows for better performance on the hardware, a
monolithic kernel can offer a comparable time to solution with less global
memory usage.

 <dc:description>  Minutiae play a major role in fingerprint identification. Extracting reliable
minutiae is difficult for latent fingerprints which are usually of poor
quality. As the limitation of traditional handcrafted features, a fully
convolutional network (FCN) is utilized to learn features directly from data to
overcome complex background noises. Raw fingerprints are mapped to a
correspondingly-sized minutia-score map with a fixed stride. And thus a large
number of minutiae will be extracted through a given threshold. Then small
regions centering at these minutia points are entered into a convolutional
neural network (CNN) to reclassify these minutiae and calculate their
orientations. The CNN shares convolutional layers with the fully convolutional
network to speed up. 0.45 second is used on average to detect one fingerprint
on a GPU. On the NIST SD27 database, we achieve 53\% recall rate and 53\%
precise rate that outperform many other algorithms. Our trained model is also
visualized to show that we have successfully extracted features preserving
ridge information of a latent fingerprint.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present an efficient Dynamic Programing framework for
optimal planning and control of legged robots. First we formulate this problem
as an optimal control problem for switched systems. Then we propose a
multi--level optimization approach to find the optimal switching times and the
optimal continuous control inputs. Through this scheme, the decomposed
optimization can potentially be done more efficiently than the combined
approach. Finally, we present a continuous-time constrained LQR algorithm which
simultaneously optimizes the feedforward and feedback controller with $O(n)$
time-complexity. In order to validate our approach, we show the performance of
our framework on a quadrupedal robot. We choose the Center of Mass dynamics and
the full kinematic formulation as the switched system model where the switching
times as well as the contact forces and the joint velocities are optimized for
different locomotion tasks such as gap crossing, walking and trotting.

 <dc:title>Technical Report: Graph-Structured Sparse Optimization for Connected

 <dc:description>  Structured sparse optimization is an important and challenging problem for
analyzing high-dimensional data in a variety of applications such as
bioinformatics, medical imaging, social networks, and astronomy. Although a
number of structured sparsity models have been explored, such as trees, groups,
clusters, and paths, connected subgraphs have been rarely explored in the
current literature. One of the main technical challenges is that there is no
structured sparsity-inducing norm that can directly model the space of
connected subgraphs, and there is no exact implementation of a projection
oracle for connected subgraphs due to its NP-hardness. In this paper, we
explore efficient approximate projection oracles for connected subgraphs, and
propose two new efficient algorithms, namely, Graph-IHT and Graph-GHTP, to
optimize a generic nonlinear objective function subject to connectivity
constraint on the support of the variables. Our proposed algorithms enjoy
strong guarantees analogous to several current methods for sparsity-constrained
optimization, such as Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), Approximate Model
Iterative Hard Thresholding (AM-IHT), and Gradient Hard Thresholding Pursuit
(GHTP) with respect to convergence rate and approximation accuracy. We apply
our proposed algorithms to optimize several well-known graph scan statistics in
several applications of connected subgraph detection as a case study, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Gaussian state space models have been used for decades as generative models
of sequential data. They admit an intuitive probabilistic interpretation, have
a simple functional form, and enjoy widespread adoption. We introduce a unified
algorithm to efficiently learn a broad class of linear and non-linear state
space models, including variants where the emission and transition
distributions are modeled by deep neural networks. Our learning algorithm
simultaneously learns a compiled inference network and the generative model,
leveraging a structured variational approximation parameterized by recurrent
neural networks to mimic the posterior distribution. We apply the learning
algorithm to both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its
scalability and versatility. We find that using the structured approximation to
the posterior results in models with significantly higher held-out likelihood.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a study of improvement in stability in a single machine
connected to infinite bus (SMIB) power system by using static compensator
(STATCOM). The gains of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller in
STATCOM are being optimized by heuristic technique based on Particle swarm
optimization (PSO). Further, Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) as an
alternative heuristic method is also applied to select optimal gains of PID
controller. The performance of STATCOM with the above soft-computing techniques
are studied and compared with the conventional PID controller under various
scenarios. The simulation results are accompanied with performance indices
based quantitative analysis. The analysis clearly signifies the robustness of
the new scheme in terms of stability and voltage regulation when compared with

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a formulation for brittle fracture in 3D elastic solids
within the context of configurational mechanics. The local form of the first
law of thermodynamics provides a condition for equilibrium of the crack front.
The direction of the crack propagation is shown to be given by the direction of
the configurational forces on the crack front that maximise the local
dissipation. The evolving crack front is continuously resolved by the finite
element mesh, without the need for face splitting or the use of enrichment
techniques. A monolithic solution strategy is adopted, solving simultaneously
for both the material displacements (i.e. crack extension) and the spatial
displacements, is adopted. In order to trace the dissipative loading path, an
arc-length procedure is developed that controls the incremental crack area
growth. In order to maintain mesh quality, smoothing of the mesh is undertaken
as a continuous process, together with face flipping, node merging and edge
splitting where necessary. Hierarchical basis functions of arbitrary polynomial
order are adopted to increase the order of approximation without the need to
change the finite element mesh. Performance of the formulation is demonstrated
by means of three representative numerical simulations, demonstrating both
accuracy and robustness.

 <dc:title>On Optimal Latency of Communications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Au, Minh</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we investigate the optimal latency of communications. Focusing
on fixed rate communication without any feedback channel, this paper
encompasses low-latency strategies with which one hop and multi-hop
communication issues are treated from an information theoretic perspective. By
defining the latency as the time required to make decisions, we prove that if
short messages can be transmitted in parallel Gaussian channels, for example,
via orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-like signals, there
exists an optimal low-latency strategy for every code. This can be achieved via
early-detection schemes or asynchronous detections. We first provide the
optimal achievable latency in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels for
every channel code given a probability block error $\epsilon$. This can be
obtained via sequential ratio tests or a &quot;genie&quot; aided, \textit{e.g}.
error-detecting codes. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
Next, we show how early-detection can be effective with OFDM signals while
maintaining its spectral efficiency via random coding or pre-coding random
matrices. Finally, we explore the optimal low-latency strategy in multi-hop
relaying schemes. For amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF)
relaying schemes there exist an optimal achievable latency. In particular, we
first show that there exist a better low-latency strategy, for which AF relays
could transmit while receiving. This can be achieved by using amplify and
forward combined with early detection.

 <dc:description>  Revenue optimization of large data centers is an open and challenging
problem. The intricacy of the problem is due to the presence of too many
parameters posing as costs or investment. This paper proposes a model to
optimize the revenue in cloud data center and analyzes the model, revenue and
different investment or cost commitments of organizations investing in data
centers. The model uses the Cobb-Douglas production function to quantify the
boundaries and the most significant factors to generate the revenue. The
dynamics between revenue and cost is explored by designing an experiment (DoE)
which is an interpretation of revenue as function of cost/investment as factors
with different levels/fluctuations. Optimal elasticities associated with these
factors of the model for maximum revenue are computed and verified . The model
response is interpreted in light of the business scenario of data centers.

 <dc:title>A Normalizing Computation Rule for Propositional Extensionality in

 <dc:description>  The univalence axiom expresses the principle of extensionality for dependent
type theory. However, if we simply add the univalence axiom to type theory,
then we lose the property of canonicity - that every closed term computes to a
canonical form. A computation becomes `stuck' when it reaches the point that it
needs to evaluate a proof term that is an application of the univalence axiom.
So we wish to find a way to compute with the univalence axiom. While this
problem has been solved with the formulation of cubical type theory, where the
computations are expressed using a nominal extension of lambda-calculus, it may
be interesting to explore alternative solutions, which do not require such an
extension.
  As a first step, we present here a system of propositional higher-order
minimal logic (PHOML). There are three kinds of typing judgement in PHOML.
There are terms which inhabit types, which are the simple types over $\Omega$.
There are proofs which inhabit propositions, which are the terms of type
$\Omega$. The canonical propositions are those constructed from $\bot$ by
implication $\supset$. Thirdly, there are paths which inhabit equations $M =_A
N$, where $M$ and $N$ are terms of type $A$. There are two ways to prove an
equality: reflexivity, and propositional extensionality - logically equivalent
propositions are equal. This system allows for some definitional equalities
that are not present in cubical type theory, namely that transport along the
trivial path is identity.
  We present a call-by-name reduction relation for this system, and prove that
the system satisfies canonicity: every closed typable term head-reduces to a
canonical form. This work has been formalised in Agda.

 <dc:title>Microscopic Pedestrian Flow Characteristics: Development of an Image
  Processing Data Collection and Simulation Model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Teknomo, Kardi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Microscopic pedestrian studies consider detailed interaction of pedestrians
to control their movement in pedestrian traffic flow. The tools to collect the
microscopic data and to analyze microscopic pedestrian flow are still very much
in its infancy. The microscopic pedestrian flow characteristics need to be
understood. Manual, semi manual and automatic image processing data collection
systems were developed. It was found that the microscopic speed resemble a
normal distribution with a mean of 1.38 m/second and standard deviation of 0.37
m/second. The acceleration distribution also bear a resemblance to the normal
distribution with an average of 0.68 m/ square second. A physical based
microscopic pedestrian simulation model was also developed. Both Microscopic
Video Data Collection and Microscopic Pedestrian Simulation Model generate a
database called NTXY database. The formulations of the flow performance or
microscopic pedestrian characteristics are explained. Sensitivity of the
simulation and relationship between the flow performances are described.
Validation of the simulation using real world data is then explained through
the comparison between average instantaneous speed distributions of the real
world data with the result of the simulations. The simulation model is then
applied for some experiments on a hypothetical situation to gain more
understanding of pedestrian behavior in one way and two way situations, to know
the behavior of the system if the number of elderly pedestrian increases and to
evaluate a policy of lane-like segregation toward pedestrian crossing and
inspects the performance of the crossing. It was revealed that the microscopic
pedestrian studies have been successfully applied to give more understanding to
the behavior of microscopic pedestrians flow, predict the theoretical and
practical situation and evaluate some design policies before its
implementation.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a number of experiments to model changes in a historical
Portuguese corpus composed of literary texts for the purpose of temporal text
classification. Algorithms were trained to classify texts with respect to their
publication date taking into account lexical variation represented as word
n-grams, and morphosyntactic variation represented by part-of-speech (POS)
distribution. We report results of 99.8% accuracy using word unigram features
with a Support Vector Machines classifier to predict the publication date of
documents in time intervals of both one century and half a century. A feature
analysis is performed to investigate the most informative features for this
task and how they are linked to language change.

of a 3- regular graph into P4 paths. The paths represent the disks of the DSS
and the edges of the graph act as the blocks of storage. We deduce the
properties of the DSS from a related graph and show their optimality.

 <dc:description>  Cognitive radio (CR) has been considered as a promising technology to enhance
spectrum efficiency via opportunistic transmission at link level. Basic CR
features allow SUs to transmit only when the licensed primary channel is not
occupied by PUs. However, waiting for idle time slot may include large packet
delay and high energy consumption. We further consider that the SU may decide,
at any moment, to use another dedicated way of communication (3G) in order to
transmit its packets. Thus, we consider an Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA)
mechanism that takes into account packet delay and energy consumption. We
formulate the OSA problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process
(POMDP) by explicitly considering the energy consumption as well as packets'
delay, which are often ignored in existing OSA solutions. Specifically, we
consider a POMDP with an average reward criterion. We derive structural
properties of the value function and we show the existence of optimal
strategies in the class of the threshold strategies. For implementation
purposes, we propose online learning mechanisms that estimate the PU activity
and determine the appropriate threshold strategy on the fly. In particular,
numerical illustrations validate our theoretical findings.

 <dc:title>Exploiting Universal Redundancy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shoker, Ali</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Fault tolerance is essential for building reliable services; however, it
comes at the price of redundancy, mainly the &quot;replication factor&quot; and
&quot;diversity&quot;. With the increasing reliance on Internet-based services, more
machines (mainly servers) are needed to scale out, multiplied with the extra
expense of replication. This paper revisits the very fundamentals of fault
tolerance and presents &quot;artificial redundancy&quot;: a formal generalization of
&quot;exact copy&quot; redundancy in which new sources of redundancy are exploited to
build fault tolerant systems. On this concept, we show how to build &quot;artificial
replication&quot; and design &quot;artificial fault tolerance&quot; (AFT). We discuss the
properties of these new techniques showing that AFT extends current fault
tolerant approaches to use other forms of redundancy aiming at reduced cost and
high diversity.

 <dc:description>  Neural networks have proven effective for solving many difficult
computational problems. Implementing complex neural networks in software is
very computationally expensive. To explore the limits of information
processing, it will be necessary to implement new hardware platforms with large
numbers of neurons, each with a large number of connections to other neurons.
Here we propose a hybrid semiconductor-superconductor hardware platform for the
implementation of neural networks and large-scale neuromorphic computing. The
platform combines semiconducting few-photon light-emitting diodes with
superconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors to behave as spiking neurons.
These processing units are connected via a network of optical waveguides, and
variable weights of connection can be implemented using several approaches. The
use of light as a signaling mechanism overcomes fanout and parasitic
constraints on electrical signals while simultaneously introducing physical
degrees of freedom which can be employed for computation. The use of
supercurrents achieves the low power density necessary to scale to systems with
enormous entropy. The proposed processing units can operate at speeds of at
least $20$ MHz with fully asynchronous activity, light-speed-limited latency,
and power densities on the order of 1 mW/cm$^2$ for neurons with 700
connections operating at full speed at 2 K. The processing units achieve an
energy efficiency of $\approx 20$ aJ per synapse event. By leveraging
multilayer photonics with deposited waveguides and superconductors with feature
sizes $&gt;$ 100 nm, this approach could scale to systems with massive
interconnectivity and complexity for advanced computing as well as explorations
of information processing capacity in systems with an enormous number of
information-bearing microstates.

 <dc:description>  Detecting a small number of outliers from a set of data observations is
always challenging. This problem is more difficult in the setting of multiple
network samples, where computing the anomalous degree of a network sample is
generally not sufficient. In fact, explaining why the network is exceptional,
expressed in the form of subnetwork, is also equally important. In this paper,
we develop a novel algorithm to address these two key problems. We treat each
network sample as a potential outlier and identify subnetworks that mostly
discriminate it from nearby regular samples. The algorithm is developed in the
framework of network regression combined with the constraints on both network
topology and L1-norm shrinkage to perform subnetwork discovery. Our method thus
goes beyond subspace/subgraph discovery and we show that it converges to a
global optimum. Evaluation on various real-world network datasets demonstrates
that our algorithm not only outperforms baselines in both network and high
dimensional setting, but also discovers highly relevant and interpretable local
subnetworks, further enhancing our understanding of anomalous networks.

 <dc:description>  Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has gained a lot of
popularity over the years. Due to its popularity, OFDM has been adopted as a
standard in cellular technology and Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
communication systems. To improve the bit error rate (BER) performance, forward
error correction (FEC) codes are often utilized to protect signals against
unknown interference and channel degradations. In this paper, we apply
soft-decision FEC, more specifically polar codes and a convolutional code, to
an OFDM system in a quasi-static multipath fading channel, and compare BER
performance in various channels. We investigate the effect of interleaving bits
within a polar codeword. Finally, the simulation results for each case are
presented in the paper.

 <dc:title>Review of Buffer-Aided Distributed Space-Time Coding Schemes and

 <dc:creator>Gu, J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>de Lamare, R. C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose buffer-aided distributed space-time coding (DSTC)
schemes and relay selection algorithms for cooperative direct-sequence
code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems. We first devise a relay pair
selection algorithm that can form relay pairs and then select the optimum set
of relays among both the source-relay phase and the relay-destination phase
according to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) criterion.
Multiple relays equipped with dynamic buffers are then introduced in the
network, which allows the relays to store data received from the sources and
wait until the most appropriate time for transmission. { A greedy relay pair
selection algorithm is then developed to reduce the high cost of the exhaustive
search required when a large number of relays are involved.} The proposed
techniques effectively improve the quality of the transmission with an
acceptable delay as the buffer size is adjustable. An analysis of the
computational complexity of the proposed algorithms, the delay and a study of
the greedy algorithm are then carried out. Simulation results show that the
proposed dynamic buffer-aided DSTC schemes and algorithms outperform prior art.

 <dc:title>Minimal Inputs/Outputs for a Networked System</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhou, Tong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the minimal number of inputs/outputs required to
guarantees the controllability/observability of a system, under the condition
that its state transition matrix (STM) is prescribed. It has been proved that
this minimal number is equal to the maximum geometric multiplicity of the
system STM. The obtained conclusions are in sharp contrast to those established
for the problems of finding the sparest input/output matrix under the
restriction of system controllability/observabilty, which have been proved to
be NP-hard, and even impossible to be approximated within a multiplicative
factor. Moreover, a complete parametrization is also provided for the
input/output matrix of a system with this minimal input/output number.

 <dc:description>  While state-of-the-art kernels for graphs with discrete labels scale well to
graphs with thousands of nodes, the few existing kernels for graphs with
continuous attributes, unfortunately, do not scale well. To overcome this
limitation, we present hash graph kernels, a general framework to derive
kernels for graphs with continuous attributes from discrete ones. The idea is
to iteratively turn continuous attributes into discrete labels using randomized
hash functions. We illustrate hash graph kernels for the Weisfeiler-Lehman
subtree kernel and for the shortest-path kernel. The resulting novel graph
kernels are shown to be, both, able to handle graphs with continuous attributes
and scalable to large graphs and data sets. This is supported by our
theoretical analysis and demonstrated by an extensive experimental evaluation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, with respect to multichannel synthetic aperture radars (SAR),
we first formulate the problems of Doppler ambiguities on the radial velocity
(RV) estimation of a ground moving target in range-compressed domain,
range-Doppler domain and image domain, respectively. It is revealed that in
these problems, a cascaded time-space Doppler ambiguity (CTSDA) may encounter,
i.e., time domain Doppler ambiguity (TDDA) in each channel arises first and
then spatial domain Doppler ambiguity (SDDA) among multi-channels arises
second. Accordingly, the multichannel SAR systems with different parameters are
investigated in three different cases with diverse Doppler ambiguity
properties, and a multi-frequency SAR is then proposed to obtain the RV
estimation by solving the ambiguity problem based on Chinese remainder theorem
(CRT). In the first two cases, the ambiguity problem can be solved by the
existing closed-form robust CRT. In the third case, it is found that the
problem is different from the conventional CRT problems and we call it a double
remaindering problem in this paper. We then propose a sufficient condition
under which the double remaindering problem, i.e., the CTSDA, can also be
solved by the closed-form robust CRT. When the sufficient condition is not
satisfied for a multi-channel SAR, a searching based method is proposed.
Finally, some results of numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods.

 <dc:description>  Cooperative communication can improve communication quality in wireless
communication networks through strategic relay selection. However, wireless
cooperative communication networks are vulnerable to the attacks initiated on
relays. Although applying authentication protocols can secure cooperative
communication when the selected relay is malicious, better system throughput
could be obtained without executing authentication protocol when the selected
relay is free from attacker's attack. In this paper, a game theoretic approach
is proposed to quantitatively analyze the attacking strategies of the attacker
who chooses one relay to attack so as to make rational decision on relay
selection and extent of applying authentication protocols, which reaches the
trade-off between system security requirement and quality of service (QoS) in
wireless cooperative communication networks.

 <dc:title>Vocabulary Selection Strategies for Neural Machine Translation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Classical translation models constrain the space of possible outputs by
selecting a subset of translation rules based on the input sentence. Recent
work on improving the efficiency of neural translation models adopted a similar
strategy by restricting the output vocabulary to a subset of likely candidates
given the source. In this paper we experiment with context and embedding-based
selection methods and extend previous work by examining speed and accuracy
trade-offs in more detail. We show that decoding time on CPUs can be reduced by
up to 90% and training time by 25% on the WMT15 English-German and WMT16
English-Romanian tasks at the same or only negligible change in accuracy. This
brings the time to decode with a state of the art neural translation system to
just over 140 msec per sentence on a single CPU core for English-German.

 <dc:description>  Forecasting the flow of crowds is of great importance to traffic management
and public safety, yet a very challenging task affected by many complex
factors, such as inter-region traffic, events and weather. In this paper, we
propose a deep-learning-based approach, called ST-ResNet, to collectively
forecast the in-flow and out-flow of crowds in each and every region through a
city. We design an end-to-end structure of ST-ResNet based on unique properties
of spatio-temporal data. More specifically, we employ the framework of the
residual neural networks to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend
properties of the crowd traffic, respectively. For each property, we design a
branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial
properties of the crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the
output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different
weights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined
with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the
final traffic of crowds in each and every region. We evaluate ST-ResNet based
on two types of crowd flows in Beijing and NYC, finding that its performance
exceeds six well-know methods.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of allocating a set $I$ of $m$ indivisible resources
(items) to a set $P$ of $n$ customers (players) competing for the resources.
Each resource $j \in I$ has a same value $v_j &gt; 0$ for a subset of customers
interested in $j$, and zero value for the remaining customers. The utility
received by each customer is the sum of the values of the resources allocated
to her. The goal is to find a feasible allocation of the resources to the
interested customers such that for the Max-Min allocation problem (Min-Max
allocation problem) the minimum of the utilities (maximum of the utilities)
received by the customers is maximized (minimized). The Max-Min allocation
problem is also known as the \textit{Fair Allocation problem}, or the
\textit{Santa Claus problem}. The Min-Max allocation problem is the problem of
Scheduling on Unrelated Parallel Machines, and is also known as the $R \, | \,
| C_{\max}$ problem.
  In this paper, we are interested in instances of the problem that admit a
Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS). We show that an ordering property
on the resources and the customers is important and paves the way for a PTAS.
For the Max-Min allocation problem, we start with instances of the problem that
can be viewed as a \textit{convex bipartite graph}; a bipartite graph for which
there exists an ordering of the resources such that each customer is interested
in (has a positive evaluation for) a set of \textit{consecutive} resources. We
demonstrate a PTAS for the inclusion-free cases. This class of instances is
equivalent to the class of bipartite permutation graphs. For the Min-Max
allocation problem, we also obtain a PTAS for inclusion-free instances. These
instances are not only of theoretical interest but also have practical
applications.

to latent class analysis --- a method widely used in social sciences and
medicine to identify homogeneous subgroups in a population. It provides new and
fruitful perspectives on a number of machine learning areas, including cluster

 <dc:description>  Web Service is one of the most significant current discussions in information
sharing technologies and one of the examples of service oriented processing. To
ensure accurate execution of web services operations, it must be adaptable with
policies of the social networks in which it signs up. This adaptation
implements using controls called 'Commitment'. This paper describes commitments
structure and existing research about commitments and social web services, then
suggests an algorithm for consistency of commitments in social web services. As
regards the commitments may be executed concurrently, a key challenge in web
services execution based on commitment structure is consistency ensuring in
execution time. The purpose of this research is providing an algorithm for
consistency ensuring between web services operations based on commitments
structure.

 <dc:description>  Learning acoustic models directly from the raw waveform data with minimal
processing is challenging. Current waveform-based models have generally used
very few (~2) convolutional layers, which might be insufficient for building
high-level discriminative features. In this work, we propose very deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that directly use time-domain waveforms as
inputs. Our CNNs, with up to 34 weight layers, are efficient to optimize over
very long sequences (e.g., vector of size 32000), necessary for processing
acoustic waveforms. This is achieved through batch normalization, residual
learning, and a careful design of down-sampling in the initial layers. Our
networks are fully convolutional, without the use of fully connected layers and
dropout, to maximize representation learning. We use a large receptive field in
the first convolutional layer to mimic bandpass filters, but very small
receptive fields subsequently to control the model capacity. We demonstrate the
performance gains with the deeper models. Our evaluation shows that the CNN
with 18 weight layers outperform the CNN with 3 weight layers by over 15% in
absolute accuracy for an environmental sound recognition task and matches the
performance of models using log-mel features.

 <dc:description>  UAV control system is a huge and complex system, and to design and test a UAV
control system is time-cost and money-cost. This paper considered the
simulation of identification of a nonlinear system dynamics using artificial
neural networks approach. This experiment develops a neural network model of
the plant that we want to control. In the control design stage, experiment uses
the neural network plant model to design (or train) the controller. We use
Matlab to train the network and simulate the behavior. This chapter provides
the mathematical overview of MRC technique and neural network architecture to
simulate nonlinear identification of UAV systems. MRC provides a direct and
effective method to control a complex system without an equation-driven model.
NN approach provides a good framework to implement MEC by identifying
complicated models and training a controller for it.

 <dc:description>  Many programming language techniques for incremental computation employ
programmer-specified names for cached information. At runtime, each name
identifies a &quot;cache location&quot; for a dynamic data value or a sub-computation; in
sum, these cache location choices guide change propagation and incremental
(re)execution.
  We call a cache location name precise when it identifies at most one value or
subcomputation; we call all other names imprecise, or ambiguous. At a minimum,
cache location names must be precise to ensure that change propagation works
correctly; yet, reasoning statically about names in incremental programs
remains an open problem.
  As a first step, this paper defines and solves the precise name problem,
where we verify that incremental programs with explicit names use them
precisely. To do so, we give a refinement type and effect system, and prove it
sound (every well-typed program uses names precisely). We also demonstrate that
this type system is expressive by verifying example programs that compute over
efficient representations of incremental sequences and sets. Beyond verifying
these programs, our type system also describes their dynamic naming strategies,
e.g., for library documentation purposes.

 <dc:title>Low Complexity Channel Estimation for Millimeter Wave Systems with
  Hybrid A/D Antenna Processing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alexandropoulos, George C.</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  The availability of large bandwidth at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies
is one of the major factors that rendered very high frequencies a promising
candidate enabler for fifth generation (5G) mobile communication networks. To
confront with the intrinsic characteristics of signal propagation at
frequencies of tens of GHz and being able to achieve data rates of the order of
gigabits per second, mmWave systems are expected to employ large antenna arrays
that implement highly directional beamforming. In this paper, we consider
mmWave wireless systems comprising of nodes equipped with large antenna arrays
and being capable of performing hybrid analog and digital (A/D) processing.
Intending at realizing channel-aware transmit and receive beamforming, we focus
on designing low complexity compressed sensing channel estimation. In
particular, by adopting a temporally correlated mmWave channel model, we
present two compressed sensing algorithms that exploit the temporal correlation
to reduce the complexity of sparse channel estimation, one being greedy and the
other one being iterative. Our representative performance evaluation results
offer useful insights on the interplay among some system and operation
parameters, and the accuracy of channel estimation.

 <dc:description>  We present Dithen, a novel computation-as-a-service (CaaS) cloud platform
specifically tailored to the parallel execution of large-scale multimedia
tasks. Dithen handles the upload/download of both multimedia data and
executable items, the assignment of compute units to multimedia workloads, and
the reactive control of the available compute units to minimize the cloud
infrastructure cost under deadline-abiding execution. Dithen combines three key
properties: (i) the reactive assignment of individual multimedia tasks to
available computing units according to availability and predetermined
time-to-completion constraints; (ii) optimal resource estimation based on
Kalman-filter estimates; (iii) the use of additive increase multiplicative
decrease (AIMD) algorithms (famous for being the resource management in the
transport control protocol) for the control of the number of units servicing
workloads. The deployment of Dithen over Amazon EC2 spot instances is shown to
be capable of processing more than 80,000 video transcoding, face detection and
image processing tasks (equivalent to the processing of more than 116 GB of
compressed data) for less than $1 in billing cost from EC2. Moreover, the
proposed AIMD-based control mechanism, in conjunction with the Kalman
estimates, is shown to provide for more than 27% reduction in EC2 spot instance
cost against methods based on reactive resource estimation. Finally, Dithen is
shown to offer a 38% to 500% reduction of the billing cost against the current
state-of-the-art in CaaS platforms on Amazon EC2 (Amazon Lambda and Amazon
Autoscale). A baseline version of Dithen is currently available at
http://www.dithen.com under the &quot;AutoScale&quot; option.

 <dc:description>  There are many representations of planar graphs, but few are as elegant as
Tur\'an's (1984): it is simple and practical, uses only 4 bits per edge, can
handle self-loops and multi-edges, and can store any specified embedding. Its
main disadvantage has been that &quot;it does not allow efficient searching&quot;
(Jacobson, 1989). In this paper we show how to add a sublinear number of bits
to Tur\'an's representation such that it supports fast navigation while
retaining simplicity. As a consequence of the inherited simplicity, we offer
the first efficient parallel construction of a compact encoding of a planar
graph embedding. Our experimental results show that the resulting
representation uses about 6 bits per edge in practice, supports basic
navigation operations within a few microseconds, and can be built sequentially
at a rate below 1 microsecond per edge, featuring a linear speedup with a
parallel efficiency around 50\% for large datasets.

 <dc:description>  Age and gender are complementary soft biometric traits for face recognition.
Successful estimation of age and gender from facial images taken under
real-world conditions can contribute improving the identification results in
the wild. In this study, in order to achieve robust age and gender
classification in the wild, we have benefited from Deep Convolutional Neural
Networks based representation. We have explored transferability of existing
deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models for age and gender
classification. The generic AlexNet-like architecture and domain specific
VGG-Face CNN model are employed and fine-tuned with the Adience dataset
prepared for age and gender classification in uncontrolled environments. In
addition, task specific GilNet CNN model has also been utilized and used as a
baseline method in order to compare with transferred models. Experimental
results show that both transferred deep CNN models outperform the GilNet CNN
model, which is the state-of-the-art age and gender classification approach on
the Adience dataset, by an absolute increase of 7% and 4.5% in accuracy,
respectively. This outcome indicates that transferring a deep CNN model can
provide better classification performance than a task specific CNN model, which
has a limited number of layers and trained from scratch using a limited amount
of data as in the case of GilNet. Domain specific VGG-Face CNN model has been
found to be more useful and provided better performance for both age and gender
classification tasks, when compared with generic AlexNet-like model, which
shows that transfering from a closer domain is more useful.

 <dc:description>  We undertake an investigation of combinatorial designs engendered by cellular
automata (CA), focusing in particular on orthogonal Latin squares and
orthogonal arrays. The motivation is of cryptographic nature. Indeed, we
consider the problem of employing CA to define threshold secret sharing schemes
via orthogonal Latin squares. We first show how to generate Latin squares
through bipermutive CA. Then, using a characterization based on Sylvester
matrices, we prove that two linear CA induce a pair of orthogonal Latin squares
if and only if the polynomials associated to their local rules are relatively
prime.

 <dc:title>Data-Unit-Size Distribution Model with Retransmitted Packet Size
  Preservation Property and Its Application to Goodput Analysis for
  Stop-and-Wait Protocol: Case of Independent Packet Losses</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ikegawa, Takashi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Performance</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a data-unit-size distribution model to represent the
retransmitted packet size preservation (RPSP) property in a scenario where
independently lost packets are retransmitted by a stop-and-wait protocol. RPSP
means that retransmitted packets with the same sequence number are equal in
size to the packet of the original transmission, which is identical to the
packet generated from a message through the segmentation function, namely,
generated packet. Furthermore, we derive goodput formula using an approach to
derive the data-unit-size distribution. We investigate the effect of RPSP on
frame size distributions and goodput in a simple case when no collision happens
over the bit-error prone wireless network equipped with IEEE 802.11 Distributed
Coordination Function, which is a typical example of the stop-and-wait
protocol. Numerical results show that the effect gets stronger as bit error
rate increases and the maximum size of the generated packets is larger than the
mean size for large enough packet retry limits because longer packets will be
repeatedly corrupted and retransmitted more times as a result of RPSP.

 <dc:title>How many three-dimensional Hilbert curves are there?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Haverkort, Herman</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Hilbert's two-dimensional space-filling curve is appreciated for its good
locality-preserving properties and easy implementation for many applications.
However, Hilbert did not describe how to generalize his construction to higher
dimensions. In fact, the number of ways in which this may be done ranges from
zero to infinite, depending on what properties of the Hilbert curve one
considers to be essential.
  In this work we take the point of view that a Hilbert curve should at least
be self-similar and traverse cubes octant by octant. We organize and explore
the space of possible three-dimensional Hilbert curves and the potentially
useful properties which they may have. We discuss a notation system that allows
us to distinguish the curves from one another and enumerate them. This system
has been implemented in a software prototype, available from the author's
website. Several examples of possible three-dimensional Hilbert curves are
presented, including a curve that visits the points on most sides of the unit
cube in the order of the two-dimensional Hilbert curve; curves of which not
only the eight octants are similar to each other, but also the four quarters; a
curve with excellent locality-preserving properties and endpoints that are not
vertices of the cube; a curve in which all but two octants are each other's
images with respect to reflections in axis-parallel planes; and curves that can
be sketched on a grid without using vertical line segments. In addition, we
discuss several four-dimensional Hilbert curves.

 <dc:title>A Performance-Based Scheme for Pricing Resources in the Cloud</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  With the rapid growth of the cloud computing marketplace, the issue of
pricing resources in the cloud has been the subject of much study in recent
years. In this paper, we identify and study a new issue: how to price resources
in the cloud so that the customer's risk is minimized, while at the same time
ensuring that the provider accrues his fair share. We do this by correlating
the revenue stream of the customer to the prices charged by the provider. We
show that our mechanism is incentive compatible in that it is in the best
interest of the customer to provide his true revenue as a function of the
resources rented. We next add another restriction to the price function, i.e.,
that it be linear. This removes the distortion that creeps in when the customer
has to pay more money for less resources. Our algorithms for both the schemes
mentioned above are efficient.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose cross-modal convolutional neural networks (X-CNNs),
a novel biologically inspired type of CNN architectures, treating gradient
descent-specialised CNNs as individual units of processing in a larger-scale
network topology, while allowing for unconstrained information flow and/or
weight sharing between analogous hidden layers of the network---thus
generalising the already well-established concept of neural network ensembles
(where information typically may flow only between the output layers of the
individual networks). The constituent networks are individually designed to
learn the output function on their own subset of the input data, after which
cross-connections between them are introduced after each pooling operation to
periodically allow for information exchange between them. This injection of
knowledge into a model (by prior partition of the input data through domain
knowledge or unsupervised methods) is expected to yield greatest returns in
sparse data environments, which are typically less suitable for training CNNs.
For evaluation purposes, we have compared a standard four-layer CNN as well as
a sophisticated FitNet4 architecture against their cross-modal variants on the
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with differing percentages of the training data
being removed, and find that at lower levels of data availability, the X-CNNs
significantly outperform their baselines (typically providing a 2--6% benefit,
depending on the dataset size and whether data augmentation is used), while
still maintaining an edge on all of the full dataset tests.

 <dc:title>Personalized Prediction of Vehicle Energy Consumption based on

 <dc:description>  The advent of abundant on-board sensors and electronic devices in vehicles
populates the paradigm of participatory sensing to harness crowd-sourced data
gathering for intelligent transportation applications, such as
distance-to-empty prediction and eco-routing. While participatory sensing can
provide diverse driving data, there lacks a systematic study of effective
utilization of the data for personalized prediction. There are considerable
challenges on how to interpolate the missing data from a sparse dataset, which
often arises from participatory sensing. This paper presents and compares
various approaches for personalized vehicle energy consumption prediction,
including a blackbox framework that identifies
driver/vehicle/environment-dependent factors and a collaborative filtering
approach based on matrix factorization. Furthermore, a case study of
distance-to-empty prediction for electric vehicles by participatory sensing
data is conducted and evaluated empirically, which shows that our approaches
can significantly improve the prediction accuracy.

 <dc:title>Near-Infrared Image Dehazing Via Color Regularization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Son, Chang-Hwan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Xiao-Ping</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Near-infrared imaging can capture haze-free near-infrared gray images and
visible color images, according to physical scattering models, e.g., Rayleigh
or Mie models. However, there exist serious discrepancies in brightness and
image structures between the near-infrared gray images and the visible color
images. The direct use of the near-infrared gray images brings about another
color distortion problem in the dehazed images. Therefore, the color distortion
should also be considered for near-infrared dehazing. To reflect this point,
this paper presents an approach of adding a new color regularization to
conventional dehazing framework. The proposed color regularization can model
the color prior for unknown haze-free images from two captured images. Thus,
natural-looking colors and fine details can be induced on the dehazed images.
The experimental results show that the proposed color regularization model can
help remove the color distortion and the haze at the same time. Also, the
effectiveness of the proposed color regularization is verified by comparing
with other conventional regularizations. It is also shown that the proposed
color regularization can remove the edge artifacts which arise from the use of
the conventional dark prior model.

 <dc:description>  Recently, communication systems that are both spectrum and energy efficient
have attracted significant attention. Different from the existing research, we
investigate the throughput and energy efficiency of a general class of
multiple-input and multiple-output systems with arbitrary inputs when they are
subject to statistical quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, which are imposed
as limits on the delay violation and buffer overflow probabilities. We employ
the effective capacity as the performance metric. We obtain the optimal input
covariance matrix that maximizes the effective capacity under a short-term
average power constraint. Following that, we perform an asymptotic analysis of
the effective capacity in the low signal-to-noise ratio and large-scale antenna
regimes. In the low signal-to-noise ratio regime analysis, we utilize the first
and second derivatives of the effective capacity when the signal-to-noise ratio
approaches zero in order to determine the minimum energy-per-bit and also the
slope of the effective capacity versus energy-per-bit curve at the minimum
energy-per-bit. We observe that the minimum energy-per-bit is independent of
the input distribution, whereas the slope depends on the input distribution. In
the large-scale antenna analysis, we show that the effective capacity
approaches the average transmission rate in the channel with the increasing
number of transmit and/or receive antennas. Particularly, the gap between the
effective capacity and the average transmission rate in the channel, which is
caused by the QoS constraints, is minimized with the number of antennas. In
addition, we put forward the non-asymptotic backlog and delay violation bounds
by utilizing the effective capacity. Finally, we substantiate our analytical
results through numerical illustrations.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we introduce the method of urban association rules and its
uses for extracting frequently appearing combinations of stores that are
visited together to characterize shoppers' behaviors. The Apriori algorithm is
used to extract the association rules (i.e., if -&gt; result) from customer
transaction datasets in a market-basket analysis. An application to our
large-scale and anonymized bank card transaction dataset enables us to output
linked trips for shopping all over the city: the method enables us to predict
the other shops most likely to be visited by a customer given a particular shop
that was already visited as an input. In addition, our methodology can consider
all transaction activities conducted by customers for a whole city in addition
to the location of stores dispersed in the city. This approach enables us to
uncover not only simple linked trips such as transition movements between
stores but also the edge weight for each linked trip in the specific district.
Thus, the proposed methodology can complement conventional research methods.
Enhancing understanding of people's shopping behaviors could be useful for city
authorities and urban practitioners for effective urban management. The results
also help individual retailers to rearrange their services by accommodating the
needs of their customers' habits to enhance their shopping experience.

 <dc:description>  A major task in systematic reviews is abstract screening, i.e., excluding,
often hundreds or thousand of, irrelevant citations returned from a database
search based on titles and abstracts. Thus, a systematic review platform that
can automate the abstract screening process is of huge importance. Several
methods have been proposed for this task. However, it is very hard to clearly
understand the applicability of these methods in a systematic review platform
because of the following challenges: (1) the use of non-overlapping metrics for
the evaluation of the proposed methods, (2) usage of features that are very
hard to collect, (3) using a small set of reviews for the evaluation, and (4)
no solid statistical testing or equivalence grouping of the methods. In this
paper, we use feature representation that can be extracted per citation. We
evaluate SVM-based methods (commonly used) on a large set of reviews ($61$) and
metrics ($11$) to provide equivalence grouping of methods based on a solid
statistical test. Our analysis also includes a strong variability of the
metrics using $500$x$2$ cross validation. While some methods shine for
different metrics and for different datasets, there is no single method that
dominates the pack. Furthermore, we observe that in some cases relevant
(included) citations can be found after screening only 15-20% of them via a
certainty based sampling. A few included citations present outlying
characteristics and can only be found after a very large number of screening
steps. Finally, we present an ensemble algorithm for producing a $5$-star
rating of citations based on their relevance. Such algorithm combines the best
methods from our evaluation and through its $5$-star rating outputs a more
easy-to-consume prediction.

 <dc:description>  Subspace learning and matrix factorization problems have a great many
applications in science and engineering, and efficient algorithms are critical
as dataset sizes continue to grow. Many relevant problem formulations are
non-convex, and in a variety of contexts it has been observed that solving the
non-convex problem directly is not only efficient but reliably accurate. We
discuss convergence theory for a particular method: first order incremental
gradient descent constrained to the Grassmannian. The output of the algorithm
is an orthonormal basis for a $d$-dimensional subspace spanned by an input
streaming data matrix. We study two sampling cases: where each data vector of
the streaming matrix is fully sampled, or where it is undersampled by a
sampling matrix $A_t\in \R^{m\times n}$ with $m\ll n$. We propose an adaptive
stepsize scheme that depends only on the sampled data and algorithm outputs. We
prove that with fully sampled data, the stepsize scheme maximizes the
improvement of our convergence metric at each iteration, and this method
converges from any random initialization to the true subspace, despite the
non-convex formulation and orthogonality constraints. For the case of
undersampled data, we establish monotonic improvement on the defined
convergence metric for each iteration with high probability.

 <dc:description>  We give a strongly polynomial time algorithm which determines whether or not
a bivariate polynomial is real stable. As a corollary, this implies an
algorithm for testing whether a given linear transformation on univariate
polynomials preserves real-rootedness. The proof exploits properties of
hyperbolic polynomials to reduce real stability testing to testing
nonnegativity of a finite number of polynomials on an interval.

 <dc:description>  Automated discourse analysis tools based on Natural Language Processing (NLP)
aiming at the diagnosis of language-impairing dementias generally extract
several textual metrics of narrative transcripts. However, the absence of
sentence boundary segmentation in the transcripts prevents the direct
application of NLP methods which rely on these marks to function properly, such
as taggers and parsers. We present the first steps taken towards automatic
neuropsychological evaluation based on narrative discourse analysis, presenting
a new automatic sentence segmentation method for impaired speech. Our model
uses recurrent convolutional neural networks with prosodic, Part of Speech
(PoS) features, and word embeddings. It was evaluated intrinsically on
impaired, spontaneous speech, as well as, normal, prepared speech, and presents
better results for healthy elderly (CTL) (F1 = 0.74) and Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI) patients (F1 = 0.70) than the Conditional Random Fields method
(F1 = 0.55 and 0.53, respectively) used in the same context of our study. The
results suggest that our model is robust for impaired speech and can be used in
automated discourse analysis tools to differentiate narratives produced by MCI
and CTL.

 <dc:description>  The movement of a user's face, easily detected by a smartphone's front

introduce three sets of face-engaged interaction techniques for augmenting the
traditional mobile inputs, which leverages the combination of the head
movements with touch gestures and device motions, all sensed via the phone's
built-in sensors. We systematically present the space of design considerations
for mobile interactions using one or more of the three input modalities (i.e.,
touch, motion, and head). The additional affordances of the proposed techniques
expand the mobile interaction vocabulary, and can facilitate unique usage
scenarios such as one-hand or touch-free interaction. An initial evaluation was
conducted and users had positive reactions to the new techniques, indicating
the promise of an intuitive and convenient user experience.

 <dc:description>  A text network refers to a data type that each vertex is associated with a
text document and the relationship between documents is represented by edges.
The proliferation of text networks such as hyperlinked webpages and academic
citation networks has led to an increasing demand for quickly developing a
general sense of a new text network, namely text network exploration. In this
paper, we address the problem of text network exploration through constructing
a heterogeneous web of topics, which allows people to investigate a text
network associating word level with document level. To achieve this, a
probabilistic generative model for text and links is proposed, where three
different relationships in the heterogeneous topic web are quantified. We also
develop a prototype demo system named TopicAtlas to exhibit such heterogeneous
topic web, and demonstrate how this system can facilitate the task of text
network exploration. Extensive qualitative analyses are included to verify the
effectiveness of this heterogeneous topic web. Besides, we validate our model
on real-life text networks, showing that it preserves good performance on
objective evaluation metrics.

 <dc:description>  Numerous linear and non-linear data-detection and precoding algorithms for
wideband massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless
systems that rely on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) or
single-carrier frequency-division multiple access (SC-FDMA) require the
computation of the Gram matrix for each active subcarrier. Computing the Gram
matrix for each active subcarrier, however, results in excessively high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose novel, approximate
algorithms that significantly reduce the complexity of Gram-matrix computation
by simultaneously exploiting correlation across subcarriers and channel
hardening. We show analytically that a small fraction of Gram-matrix
computations in combination with approximate interpolation schemes are
sufficient to achieve near-optimal error-rate performance at low computational
complexity in massive MU-MIMO systems. We also demonstrate that the proposed
methods exhibit improved robustness against channel-estimation errors compared
to exact Gram-matrix interpolation algorithms that typically require high
computational complexity.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional networks have marked their place over the last few years as the
best performing model for various visual tasks. They are, however, most suited
for supervised learning from large amounts of labeled data. Previous attempts
have been made to use unlabeled data to improve model performance by applying
unsupervised techniques. These attempts require different architectures and
training methods. In this work we present a novel approach for unsupervised
training of Convolutional networks that is based on contrasting between spatial
regions within images. This criterion can be employed within conventional
neural networks and trained using standard techniques such as SGD and

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel framework for modeling temporal events with
complex longitudinal dependency that are generated by dependent sources. This
framework takes advantage of multidimensional point processes for modeling time
of events. The intensity function of the proposed process is a mixture of
intensities, and its complexity grows with the complexity of temporal patterns
of data. Moreover, it utilizes a hierarchical dependent nonparametric approach
to model marks of events. These capabilities allow the proposed model to adapt
its temporal and topical complexity according to the complexity of data, which
makes it a suitable candidate for real world scenarios. An online inference
algorithm is also proposed that makes the framework applicable to a vast range
of applications. The framework is applied to a real world application, modeling
the diffusion of contents over networks. Extensive experiments reveal the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in comparison with state-of-the-art
methods.

 <dc:description>  In everyday life. Technological advancement can be found in many facets of
life, including personal computers, mobile devices, wearables, cloud services,
video gaming, web-powered messaging, social media, Internet-connected devices,
etc. This technological influence has resulted in these technologies being
employed by criminals to conduct a range of crimes -- both online and offline.
Both the number of cases requiring digital forensic analysis and the sheer
volume of information to be processed in each case has increased rapidly in
recent years. As a result, the requirement for digital forensic investigation
has ballooned, and law enforcement agencies throughout the world are scrambling
to address this demand. While more and more members of law enforcement are
being trained to perform the required investigations, the supply is not keeping
up with the demand. Current digital forensic techniques are arduously
time-consuming and require a significant amount of man power to execute. This
paper discusses a novel solution to combat the digital forensic backlog. This
solution leverages a deduplication-based paradigm to eliminate the
reacquisition, redundant storage, and reanalysis of previously processed data.

 <dc:description>  Seismic full-waveform inversion tries to estimate subsurface medium
parameters from seismic data. Areas with subsurface salt bodies are of
particular interest because they often have hydrocarbon reservoirs on their
sides or underneath. Accurate reconstruction of their geometry is a challenge
for current techniques. This paper presents a parametric level-set method for
the reconstruction of salt-bodies in seismic full-waveform inversion. We split
the subsurface model in two parts: a background velocity model and the salt
body with known velocity but undetermined shape. The salt geometry is
represented by a level-set function that evolves during the inversion. We
choose radial basis functions to represent the level-set function, leading to
an optimization problem with a modest number of parameters. A common problem
with level-set methods is to fine tune the width of the level-set boundary for
optimal sensitivity. We propose a robust algorithm that dynamically adapts the
width of the level-set boundary to ensure faster convergence. Tests on a suite
of idealized salt geometries show that the proposed method is stable against a
modest amount of noise. We also extend the method to joint inversion of both
the background velocity model and the salt-geometry.

 <dc:description>  Coordination is essential for dynamic distributed systems whose components
exhibit interactive and autonomous behaviors. Spatially distributed, locally
interacting, propagating computational fields are particularly appealing for
allowing components to join and leave with little or no overhead. Computational
fields are a key ingredient of aggregate programming, a promising software
engineering methodology particularly relevant for the Internet of Things. In
our approach, space topology is represented by a fixed graph-shaped field,
namely a network with attributes on both nodes and arcs, where arcs represent
interaction capabilities between nodes. We propose a SMuC calculus where
mu-calculus- like modal formulas represent how the values stored in neighbor
nodes should be combined to update the present node. Fixpoint operations can be
understood globally as recursive definitions, or locally as asynchronous
converging propagation processes. We present a distributed implementation of
our calculus. The translation is first done mapping SMuC programs into normal
form, purely iterative programs and then into distributed programs. Some key
results are presented that show convergence of fixpoint computations under fair
asynchrony and under reinitialization of nodes. The first result allows nodes
to proceed at different speeds, while the second one provides robustness
against certain kinds of failure. We illustrate our approach with a case study
based on a disaster recovery scenario, implemented in a prototype simulator
that we use to evaluate the performance of a recovery strategy.

 <dc:title>Square-root algorithms for maximum correntropy estimation of linear
  discrete-time systems in presence of non-Gaussian noise</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kulikova, Maria V.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent developments in the realm of state estimation of stochastic dynamic
systems in the presence of non-Gaussian noise have induced a new methodology
called the maximum correntropy filtering. The filters designed under the
maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) utilize a similarity measure (or
correntropy) between two random variables as a cost function. They are shown to
improve the estimators' robustness against outliers or impulsive noises. In
this paper we explore the numerical stability of linear filtering technique
proposed recently under the MCC approach. The resulted estimator is called the
maximum correntropy criterion Kalman filter (MCC-KF). The purpose of this study
is two-fold. First, the previously derived MCC-KF equations are revise and the
related Kalman-like equality conditions are proved. Based on this theoretical
finding, we improve the MCC-KF technique in the sense that the new method
possesses a better estimation quality with the reduced computational cost
compared with the previously proposed MCC-KF variant. Second, we devise some
square-root implementations for the newly-designed improved estimator. The
square-root algorithms are well known to be inherently more stable than the
conventional Kalman-like implementations, which process the full error
covariance matrix in each iteration step of the filter. Additionally, following
the latest achievements in the KF community, all square-root algorithms are
formulated here in the so-called array form. All the MCC-KF variants developed
in this paper are demonstrated to outperform the previously proposed MCC-KF
version in two numerical examples.

 <dc:description>  In this letter, a novel weighted ensemble classifier is proposed that
improves classification accuracy and minimizes the number of classifiers.
Ensemble weight finding problem is modeled as a cost function with following
terms: (a) a data fidelity term aiming to decrease misclassification rate, (b)
a sparsity term aiming to decrease the number of classifiers, and (c) a
non-negativity constraint on the weights of the classifiers. The proposed cost
function is a non-convex and hard to solve; thus, convex relaxation techniques
and novel approximations are employed to obtain a numerically efficient
solution. The proposed method achieves better or similar performance compared
to state-of-the art classifier ensemble methods, while using lower number of
classifiers.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes the extension and optimization of our previous work on
very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for effective recognition of
noisy speech in the Aurora 4 task. The appropriate number of convolutional
layers, the sizes of the filters, pooling operations and input feature maps are
all modified: the filter and pooling sizes are reduced and dimensions of input
feature maps are extended to allow adding more convolutional layers.
Furthermore appropriate input padding and input feature map selection
strategies are developed. In addition, an adaptation framework using joint
training of very deep CNN with auxiliary features i-vector and fMLLR features
is developed. These modifications give substantial word error rate reductions
over the standard CNN used as baseline. Finally the very deep CNN is combined
with an LSTM-RNN acoustic model and it is shown that state-level weighted log
likelihood score combination in a joint acoustic model decoding scheme is very
effective. On the Aurora 4 task, the very deep CNN achieves a WER of 8.81%,
further 7.99% with auxiliary feature joint training, and 7.09% with LSTM-RNN
joint decoding.

 <dc:title>Deep Learning Algorithms for Signal Recognition in Long Perimeter

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we show an approach to build deep learning algorithms for
recognizing signals in distributed fiber optic monitoring and security systems
for long perimeters. Synthesizing such detection algorithms poses a non-trivial
research and development challenge, because these systems face stringent error
(type I and II) requirements and operate in difficult signal-jamming
environments, with intensive signal-like jamming and a variety of changing
possible signal portraits of possible recognized events. To address these
issues, we have developed a twolevel event detection architecture, where the
primary classifier is based on an ensemble of deep convolutional networks, can
recognize 7 classes of signals and receives time-space data frames as input.
Using real-life data, we have shown that the applied methods result in
efficient and robust multiclass detection algorithms that have a high degree of
adaptability.

 <dc:description>  Adaptive thresholding methods have proved to yield high SNRs and fast
convergence in finding the solution to the Compressed Sensing (CS) problems.
Recently, it was observed that the robustness of a class of iterative sparse
recovery algorithms such as Iterative Method with Adaptive Thresholding (IMAT)
has outperformed the well-known LASSO algorithm in terms of reconstruction
quality, convergence speed, and the sensitivity to the noise. In this paper, we
introduce a new method towards solving the CS problem. The logic of this method
is based on iterative projections of the thresholded signal onto the null-space
of the sensing matrix. The thresholding is carried out by recovering the
support of the desired signal by projection on thresholding subspaces. The
simulations reveal that the proposed method has the capability of yielding
noticeable output SNR values with about as many samples as twice the sparsity
number, while other methods fail to recover the signals when approaching the
algebraic bound for the number of samples required. The computational
complexity of our method is also comparable to other methods as observed in the
simulations. We have also extended our Algorithm to Matrix Completion (MC)
scenarios and compared its efficiency to other well-reputed approaches for MC
in the literature.

 <dc:description>  We propose Flock; a simple and scalable protocol that enables live migration
of Virtual Machines (VMs) across heterogeneous edge and conventional cloud
platforms to improve the responsiveness of cloud services. Flock is designed
with properties that are suitable for the use cases of the Internet of Things
(IoT). We describe the properties of regularized latency measurements that
Flock can use for asynchronous and autonomous migration decisions. Such
decisions allow communicating VMs to follow a flocking-like behavior that
consists of three simple rules: separation, alignment, and cohesion. Using game
theory, we derive analytical bounds on Flock's Price of Anarchy (PoA), and
prove that flocking VMs converge to a Nash Equilibrium while settling in the
best possible cloud platforms. We verify the effectiveness of Flock through
simulations and discuss how its generic objective can simply be tweaked to
achieve other objectives, such as cloud load balancing and energy consumption
minimization.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel method for constructing Variational Autoencoder (VAE).
Instead of using pixel-by-pixel loss, we enforce deep feature consistency
between the input and the output of a VAE, which ensures the VAE's output to
preserve the spatial correlation characteristics of the input, thus leading the
output to have a more natural visual appearance and better perceptual quality.
Based on recent deep learning works such as style transfer, we employ a
pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and use its hidden features
to define a feature perceptual loss for VAE training. Evaluated on the CelebA
face dataset, we show that our model produces better results than other methods
in the literature. We also show that our method can produce latent vectors that
can capture the semantic information of face expressions and can be used to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in facial attribute prediction.

 <dc:description>  Most of the crowd abnormal event detection methods rely on complex
hand-crafted features to represent the crowd motion and appearance.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown to be a powerful tool with
excellent representational capacities, which can leverage the need for
hand-crafted features. In this paper, we show that keeping track of the changes
in the CNN feature across time can facilitate capturing the local abnormality.
We specifically propose a novel measure-based method which allows measuring the
local abnormality in a video by combining semantic information (inherited from
existing CNN models) with low-level Optical-Flow. One of the advantage of this
method is that it can be used without the fine-tuning costs. The proposed
method is validated on challenging abnormality detection datasets and the
results show the superiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-art
methods.

 <dc:description>  We assign binary and ternary error-correcting codes to the data of syntactic
structures of world languages and we study the distribution of code points in
the space of code parameters. We show that, while most codes populate the lower
region approximating a superposition of Thomae functions, there is a
substantial presence of codes above the Gilbert-Varshamov bound and even above
the asymptotic bound and the Plotkin bound. We investigate the dynamics induced
on the space of code parameters by spin glass models of language change, and
show that, in the presence of entailment relations between syntactic parameters
the dynamics can sometimes improve the code. For large sets of languages and
syntactic data, one can gain information on the spin glass dynamics from the
induced dynamics in the space of code parameters.

 <dc:description>  Content-based medical image retrieval can support diagnostic decisions by
clinical experts. Examining similar images may provide clues to the expert to
remove uncertainties in his/her final diagnosis. Beyond conventional feature
descriptors, binary features in different ways have been recently proposed to
encode the image content. A recent proposal is &quot;Radon barcodes&quot; that employ
binarized Radon projections to tag/annotate medical images with content-based
binary vectors, called barcodes. In this paper, MinMax Radon barcodes are
introduced which are superior to &quot;local thresholding&quot; scheme suggested in the
literature. Using IRMA dataset with 14,410 x-ray images from 193 different
classes, the advantage of using MinMax Radon barcodes over \emph{thresholded}
Radon barcodes are demonstrated. The retrieval error for direct search drops by
more than 15\%. As well, SURF, as a well-established non-binary approach, and
BRISK, as a recent binary method are examined to compare their results with
MinMax Radon barcodes when retrieving images from IRMA dataset. The results
demonstrate that MinMax Radon barcodes are faster and more accurate when
applied on IRMA images.

 <dc:description>  Medical images can be a valuable resource for reliable information to support
medical diagnosis. However, the large volume of medical images makes it
challenging to retrieve relevant information given a particular scenario. To
solve this challenge, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) attempts to
characterize images (or image regions) with invariant content information in
order to facilitate image search. This work presents a feature extraction
technique for medical images using stacked autoencoders, which encode images to
binary vectors. The technique is applied to the IRMA dataset, a collection of
14,410 x-ray images in order to demonstrate the ability of autoencoders to
retrieve similar x-rays given test queries. Using IRMA dataset as a benchmark,
it was found that stacked autoencoders gave excellent results with a retrieval
error of 376 for 1,733 test images with a compression of 74.61%.

 <dc:description>  To reduce the potential radiation risk, low-dose CT has attracted much
attention. However, simply lowering the radiation dose will lead to significant
deterioration of the image quality. In this paper, we propose a noise reduction
method for low-dose CT via deep neural network without accessing original
projection data. A deep convolutional neural network is trained to transform
low-dose CT images towards normal-dose CT images, patch by patch. Visual and
quantitative evaluation demonstrates a competing performance of the proposed
method.

 <dc:title>L-Convex Polyominoes are Recognizable in Real Time by 2D Cellular
  Automata</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A polyomino is said to be L-convex if any two of its cells are connected by a
4-connected inner path that changes direction at most once. The 2-dimensional
language representing such polyominoes has been recently proved to be
recognizable by tiling systems by S. Brocchi, A. Frosini, R. Pinzani and S.
Rinaldi. In an attempt to compare recognition power of tiling systems and
cellular automata, we have proved that this language can be recognized by
2-dimensional cellular automata working on the von Neumann neighborhood in real
time.
  Although the construction uses a characterization of L-convex polyominoes
that is similar to the one used for tiling systems, the real time constraint
which has no equivalent in terms of tilings requires the use of techniques that
are specific to cellular automata.

 <dc:description>  We explore techniques to significantly improve the compute efficiency and
performance of Deep Convolution Networks without impacting their accuracy. To
improve the compute efficiency, we focus on achieving high accuracy with
extremely low-precision (2-bit) weight networks, and to accelerate the
execution time, we aggressively skip operations on zero-values. We achieve the
highest reported accuracy of 76.6% Top-1/93% Top-5 on the Imagenet object
classification challenge with low-precision network\footnote{github release of
the source code coming soon} while reducing the compute requirement by ~3x
compared to a full-precision network that achieves similar accuracy.
Furthermore, to fully exploit the benefits of our low-precision networks, we
build a deep learning accelerator core, dLAC, that can achieve up to 1
TFLOP/mm^2 equivalent for single-precision floating-point operations (~2
TFLOP/mm^2 for half-precision).

 <dc:description>  The operation of most signalized intersections is governed by predefined
timing plans that are applied during specified times of the day. These plans
are designed to accommodate average conditions and are unable to respond to
large deviations in traffic flow. We propose a control approach that adjusts
time-of-day signaling plans based on a prediction of future traffic flow. The
prediction algorithm identifies correlated, low rank structure in historical
measurement data and predicts future traffic flow from real-time measurements
by determining which structural trends are prominent in the measurements. From
this prediction, the controller then determines the optimal time of day to
apply new timing plans. We demonstrate the potential benefits of this approach
using eight months of high resolution data collected at an intersection in
Beaufort, South Carolina.

 <dc:description>  The plethora of comparison shopping agents (CSAs) in today's markets enables
buyers to query more than a single CSA when shopping, and an inter-CSAs
competition naturally arises. We suggest a new approach, termed &quot;selective
price disclosure&quot;, which improves the attractiveness of a CSA by removing some
of the prices in the outputted list. The underlying idea behind this approach
is to affect the buyer's beliefs regarding the chance of obtaining more
attractive prices. The paper presents two methods, which are suitable for
fully-rational buyers, for deciding which prices among those known to the CSA
should be disclosed. The effectiveness and efficiency of the methods are
evaluated using real data collected from five CSAs. The methods are also
evaluated with human subjects, showing that selective price disclosure can be
highly effective in this case as well, however, the disclosed subset of prices
should be extracted in a different (simplistic) manner.

 <dc:description>  Subtyping in concurrency has been extensively studied since early 1990s as
one of the most interesting issues in type theory. The correctness of subtyping
relations has been usually provided as the soundness for type safety. The
converse direction, the completeness, has been largely ignored in spite of its
usefulness to define the largest subtyping relation ensuring type safety. This
paper formalises preciseness (i.e. both soundness and completeness) of
subtyping for mobile processes and studies it for the synchronous and the
asynchronous session calculi. We first prove that the well-known session
subtyping, the branching-selection subtyping, is sound and complete for the
synchronous calculus. Next we show that in the asynchronous calculus, this
subtyping is incomplete for type-safety: that is, there exist session types T
and S such that
  T can safely be considered as a subtype of S, but T &lt; S is not derivable by
the subtyping. We then propose an asynchronous subtyping system which is sound
and complete for the asynchronous calculus. The method gives a general guidance
to design rigorous channel-based subtypings respecting desired safety
properties. Both the synchronous and the asynchronous calculus are first
considered with lin ear channels only, and then they are extended with session
initialisations and c ommunications of expressions (including shared channels).

 <dc:description>  We study the influence of the dimension of cellular automata (CA) for real
time language recognition of one-dimensional languages with parallel input.
Specifically, we focus on the question of determining whether every language
that can be recognized in real time on a 2-dimensional CA working on the Moore
neighborhood can also be recognized in real time by a 1-dimensional CA working
on the standard two-way neighborhood.
  We show that 2-dimensional CA in real time can perform a linear number of
simulations of a 1-dimensional real time CA. If the two classes are equal then
the number of simulated instances can be polynomial.

 <dc:description>  Linear acceleration theorems are known for most computational models.
Although such results have been proved for two-dimensional cellular automata
working on specific neighborhoods, no general construction was known. We
present here a technique of linear acceleration for all two-dimensional
languages recognized by cellular automata working on complete neighborhoods.

 <dc:description>  The estimation of probability densities based on available data is a central
task in many statistical applications. Especially in the case of large
ensembles with many samples or high-dimensional sample spaces, computationally
efficient methods are needed. We propose a new method that is based on a
decomposition of the unknown distribution in terms of so-called distribution
elements (DEs). These elements enable an adaptive and hierarchical
discretization of the sample space with small or large elements in regions with
smoothly or highly variable densities, respectively. The novel refinement
strategy that we propose is based on statistical goodness-of-fit and pair-wise
(as an approximation to mutual) independence tests that evaluate the local
approximation of the distribution in terms of DEs. The capabilities of our new
method are inspected based on several examples of different dimensionality and
successfully compared with other state-of-the-art density estimators.

 <dc:title>Nonlinear Control of a Tethered UAV: the Taut Cable case</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on the design of a stabilizing control law for an aerial
vehicle which is physically connected to a ground station by means of a tether
cable. By taking advantage of the tensile force acting along the taut cable, it
is shown that the tethered UAV is able to maintain a non-zero attitude while
hovering in a constant position. The control objective is to stabilize the
desired configuration while simultaneously ensuring that the cable remains taut
at all times. This leads to a nonlinear control problem subject to constraints.
This paper provides a two-step solution. First, the system is stabilized using
a cascade control scheme based on thrust vectoring. Then, constraint
satisfaction is guaranteed using a novel Reference Governor scheme.

 <dc:title>A Small-Order-Polynomial-Sized Linear Program for Solving the Traveling

 <dc:description>  We present a polynomial-sized linear program (LP) for the n-city TSP drawing
upon &quot;complex flow&quot; modeling ideas by the first two authors who used an
O(n^9)xO(n^8) model*. Here we have only O(n^5) variables and O(n^4)
constraints. We do not model explicit cycles of the cities, and our modeling
does not involve the city-to-city variables-based, traditional TSP polytope
referred to in the literature as &quot;The TSP Polytope.&quot; Optimal TSP objective
value and tours are achieved by solving our proposed LP. In the case of a
unique optimum, the integral solution representing the optimal tour is obtained
using any LP solver (solution algorithm). In the case of alternate optima, an
LP solver (e.g., an interior-point solver) may stop with a fractional
(interior-point) solution, which (we prove) is a convex combination of
alternate optimal TSP tours. In such cases, one of the optimal tours can be
trivially retrieved from the solution using a simple iterative elimination
procedure we propose. We have solved over a million problems with up to 27
cities using the barrier methods of CPLEX, consistently obtaining all integer
solutions. Since LP is solvable in polynomial time and we have a model which is
of polynomial size in n, the paper is thus offering (although, incidentally) a
proof of the equality of the computational complexity classes &quot;P&quot; and &quot;NP&quot;. The
non-applicability and numerical refutations of existing extended formulations
results (such as Braun et al. (2015) or Fiorini et al. (2015) in particular)
are briefly discussed in an appendix. [*: Advances in Combinatorial
Optimization: Linear Programming Formulation of the Traveling Salesman and

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Internet Protocol (IP) is the lifeblood of the modern Internet. Its
simplicity and universality have fueled the unprecedented and lasting global
success of the current Internet. Nonetheless, some limitations of IP have been
emerging in recent years. Its original design envisaged supporting perhaps tens
of thousands of static hosts operating in a friendly academic-like setting,
mainly in order to facilitate email communication and remote access to scarce
computing resources. At present IP interconnects billions of static and mobile
devices (ranging from supercomputers to IoT gadgets) with a large and dynamic
set of popular applications. Starting in mid-1990s, the advent of mobility,
wirelessness and the web substantially shifted Internet usage and communication
paradigms. This accentuated long-term concerns about the current Internet
architecture and prompted interest in alternative designs.
  The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has been one of the key supporters
of efforts to design a set of candidate next-generation Internet architectures.
As a prominent design requirement, NSF emphasized &quot;security and privacy by
design&quot; in order to avoid the long and unhappy history of incremental patching
and retrofitting that characterizes the current Internet architecture. To this
end, as a result of a competitive process, four prominent research projects
were funded by the NSF in 2010: Nebula, Named-Data Networking (NDN),
MobilityFirst (MF), and Expressive Internet Architecture (XIA). This paper
provides a comprehensive and neutral analysis of salient security and privacy
features (and issues) in these NSF-funded Future Internet Architectures. It
also compares the four candidate designs with the current IP-based architecture
and discusses similarities, differences, and possible improvements.

 <dc:title>Reconstruction of weakly simple polygons from their edges</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Akitaya, Hugo A.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given $n$ line segments in the plane, do they form the edge set of a
\emph{weakly simple polygon}; that is, can the segment endpoints be perturbed
by at most $\varepsilon$, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, to obtain a simple polygon?
While the analogous question for \emph{simple polygons} can easily be answered
in $O(n\log n)$ time, we show that it is NP-complete for weakly simple
polygons. We give $O(n)$-time algorithms in two special cases: when all
segments are collinear, or the segment endpoints are in general position. These
results extend to the variant in which the segments are \emph{directed}, and
the counterclockwise traversal of a polygon should follow the orientation.
  We study related problems for the case that the union of the $n$ input
segments is connected. (i) If each segment can be subdivided into several
segments, find the minimum number of subdivision points to form a weakly simple
polygon. (ii) If new line segments can be added, find the minimum total length
of new segments that creates a weakly simple polygon. We give worst-case upper
and lower bounds for both problems.

 <dc:title>An Optimal Treatment Assignment Strategy to Evaluate Demand Response

 <dc:description>  Demand response is designed to motivate electricity customers to modify their
loads at critical time periods. The accurate estimation of impact of demand
response signals to customers' consumption is central to any successful
program. In practice, learning these response is nontrivial because operators
can only send a limited number of signals. In addition, customer behavior also
depends on a large number of exogenous covariates. These two features lead to a
high dimensional inference problem with limited number of observations. In this
paper, we formulate this problem by using a multivariate linear model and adopt
an experimental design approach to estimate the impact of demand response
signals. We show that randomized assignment, which is widely used to estimate
the average treatment effect, is not efficient in reducing the variance of the
estimator when a large number of covariates is present. In contrast, we present
a tractable algorithm that strategically assigns demand response signals to
customers. This algorithm achieves the optimal reduction in estimation
variance, independent of the number of covariates. The results are validated
from simulations on synthetic data.

 <dc:title>Funneled Bayesian Optimization for Design, Tuning and Control of
  Autonomous Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Bayesian optimization has become a fundamental global optimization algorithm
in many problems where sample efficiency is of paramount importance. Recently,
there has been proposed a large number of new applications in fields such as
robotics, machine learning, experimental design, simulation, etc. In this
paper, we focus on several problems that appear in robotics and autonomous
systems: algorithm tuning, automatic control and intelligent design. All those
problems can be mapped to global optimization problems. However, they become
hard optimization problems. Bayesian optimization internally uses a
probabilistic surrogate model (e.g.: Gaussian process) to learn from the
process and reduce the number of samples required. In order to generalize to
unknown functions in a black-box fashion, the common assumption is that the
underlying function can be modeled with a stationary process. Nonstationary
Gaussian process regression cannot generalize easily and it typically requires
prior knowledge of the function. Some works have designed techniques to
generalize Bayesian optimization to nonstationary functions in an indirect way,
but using techniques originally designed for regression, where the objective is
to improve the quality of the surrogate model everywhere. Instead optimization
should focus on improving the surrogate model near the optimum. In this paper,
we present a novel kernel function specially designed for Bayesian
optimization, that allows nonstationary behavior of the surrogate model in an
adaptive local region. In our experiments, we found that this new kernel
results in an improved local search (exploitation), without penalizing the
global search (exploration). We provide results in well-known benchmarks and
real applications. The new method outperforms the state of the art in Bayesian
optimization both in stationary and nonstationary problems.

 <dc:description>  Security and privacy are major concerns in modern communication networks. In
recent years, the information theory of covert communications, where the very
presence of the communication is undetectable to a watchful and determined
adversary, has been of great interest. This emerging body of work has focused
on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), discrete memoryless channels (DMCs),
and optical channels. In contrast, our recent work introduced the
information-theoretic limits for covert communications over packet channels
whose packet timings are governed by a Poisson point process. However, actual
network packet arrival times do not generally conform to the Poisson process
assumption, and thus here we consider the extension of our work to timing
channels characterized by more general renewal processes of rate $\lambda$. We
consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, the source of the packets on the
channel cannot be authenticated by Willie, and therefore Alice can insert
packets into the channel. We show that if the total number of transmitted
packets by Jack is $N$, Alice can covertly insert
$\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{N}\right)$ packets and, if she transmits more, she will
be detected by Willie. In the second scenario, packets are authenticated by
Willie but we assume that Alice and Bob share a secret key; hence, Alice alters
the timings of the packets according to a pre-shared codebook with Bob to send
information to him over a $G/M/1$ queue with service rate $\mu&gt;\lambda$. We
show that Alice can covertly and reliably transmit $\mathcal{O}(N)$ bits to Bob
when the total number of packets sent from Jack to Steve is $N$.

 <dc:description>  Sentiment Analysis (SA) is an action research area in the digital age. With
rapid and constant growth of online social media sites and services, and the
increasing amount of textual data such as - statuses, comments, reviews etc.
available in them, application of automatic SA is on the rise. However, most of
the research works on SA in natural language processing (NLP) are based on
English language. Despite being the sixth most widely spoken language in the
world, Bangla still does not have a large and standard dataset. Because of
this, recent research works in Bangla have failed to produce results that can
be both comparable to works done by others and reusable as stepping stones for
future researchers to progress in this field. Therefore, we first tried to
provide a textual dataset - that includes not just Bangla, but Romanized Bangla
texts as well, is substantial, post-processed and multiple validated, ready to
be used in SA experiments. We tested this dataset in Deep Recurrent model,
specifically, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), using two types of loss functions
- binary crossentropy and categorical crossentropy, and also did some
experimental pre-training by using data from one validation to pre-train the
other and vice versa. Lastly, we documented the results along with some
analysis on them, which were promising.

to choose between a variety of possible conditioning sets for a pair of
variables, one should choose the one with the highest p-value. One can use the
CPC (Conservative PC, Ramsey et al., 2012) algorithm as a guide to possible
sepsets for a pair of variables. However, whereas CPC uses a voting rule to
classify colliders versus noncolliders, our proposed algorithm, PC-Max, picks
the conditioning set with the highest p-value, so that there are no
ambiguities. We combine this with two other optimizations: (a) avoiding
bidirected edges in the orientation of colliders, and (b) parallelization. For
(b) we borrow ideas from the PC-Stable algorithm (Colombo and Maathuis, 2014).
The result is an algorithm that scales quite well both in terms of accuracy and
time, with no risk of bidirected edges.

 <dc:description>  Consider a channel where authorized transmitter Jack sends packets to
authorized receiver Steve according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$
packets per second for a time period $T$. Suppose that covert transmitter Alice
wishes to communicate information to covert receiver Bob on the same channel
without being detected by a watchful adversary Willie. We consider two
scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that warden Willie cannot look at
packet contents but rather can only observe packet timings, and Alice must send
information by inserting her own packets into the channel. We show that the
number of packets that Alice can covertly transmit to Bob is on the order of
the square root of the number of packets that Jack transmits to Steve;
conversely, if Alice transmits more than that, she will be detected by Willie
with high probability. In the second scenario, we assume that Willie can look
at packet contents but that Alice can communicate across an $M/M/1$ queue to
Bob by altering the timings of the packets going from Jack to Steve. First,
Alice builds a codebook, with each codeword consisting of a sequence of packet
timings to be employed for conveying the information associated with that
codeword. However, to successfully employ this codebook, Alice must always have
a packet to send at the appropriate time. Hence, leveraging our result from the
first scenario, we propose a construction where Alice covertly slows down the
packet stream so as to buffer packets to use during a succeeding codeword
transmission phase. Using this approach, Alice can covertly and reliably
transmit $\mathcal{O}(\lambda T)$ covert bits to Bob in time period $T$ over an
$M/M/1$ queue with service rate $\mu &gt; \lambda$.

 <dc:title>Near-Infrared Coloring via a Contrast-Preserving Mapping Model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Son, Chang-Hwan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Xiao-Ping</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Near-infrared gray images captured together with corresponding visible color
images have recently proven useful for image restoration and classification.
This paper introduces a new coloring method to add colors to near-infrared gray
images based on a contrast-preserving mapping model. A naive coloring method
directly adds the colors from the visible color image to the near-infrared gray
image; however, this method results in an unrealistic image because of the
discrepancies in brightness and image structure between the captured
near-infrared gray image and the visible color image. To solve the discrepancy
problem, first we present a new contrast-preserving mapping model to create a
new near-infrared gray image with a similar appearance in the luminance plane
to the visible color image, while preserving the contrast and details of the
captured near-infrared gray image. Then based on the proposed
contrast-preserving mapping model, we develop a method to derive realistic
colors that can be added to the newly created near-infrared gray image.
Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only preserve the
local contrasts and details of the captured near-infrared gray image, but
transfers the realistic colors from the visible color image to the newly
created near-infrared gray image. Experimental results also show that the
proposed approach can be applied to near-infrared denoising.

 <dc:description>  Covert communication, also known as low probability of detection (LPD)
communication, prevents the adversary from knowing that a communication is
taking place. Recent work has demonstrated that, in a three-party scenario with
a transmitter (Alice), intended recipient (Bob), and adversary (Warden Willie),
the maximum number of bits that can be transmitted reliably from Alice to Bob
without detection by Willie, when additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels
exist between all parties, is on the order of the square root of the number of
channel uses. In this paper, we begin consideration of network scenarios by
studying the case where there are additional &quot;friendly&quot; nodes present in the
environment that can produce artificial noise to aid in hiding the
communication. We establish achievability results by considering constructions
where the system node closest to the warden produces artificial noise and
demonstrate a significant improvement in the throughput achieved covertly,
without requiring close coordination between Alice and the noise-generating
node. Conversely, under mild restrictions on the communication strategy, we
demonstrate no higher covert throughput is possible. Extensions to the
consideration of the achievable covert throughput when multiple wardens
randomly located in the environment collaborate to attempt detection of the
transmitter are also considered.

 <dc:title>Rain Removal via Shrinkage-Based Sparse Coding and Learned Rain
  Dictionary</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Son, Chang-Hwan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Xiao-Ping</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new rain removal model based on the shrinkage of the
sparse codes for a single image. Recently, dictionary learning and sparse
coding have been widely used for image restoration problems. These methods can
also be applied to the rain removal by learning two types of rain and non-rain
dictionaries and forcing the sparse codes of the rain dictionary to be zero
vectors. However, this approach can generate unwanted edge artifacts and detail
loss in the non-rain regions. Based on this observation, a new approach for
shrinking the sparse codes is presented in this paper. To effectively shrink
the sparse codes in the rain and non-rain regions, an error map between the
input rain image and the reconstructed rain image is generated by using the
learned rain dictionary. Based on this error map, both the sparse codes of rain
and non-rain dictionaries are used jointly to represent the image structures of
objects and avoid the edge artifacts in the non-rain regions. In the rain
regions, the correlation matrix between the rain and non-rain dictionaries is
calculated. Then, the sparse codes corresponding to the highly correlated
signal-atoms in the rain and non-rain dictionaries are shrunk jointly to
improve the removal of the rain structures. The experimental results show that
the proposed shrinkage-based sparse coding can preserve image structures and
avoid the edge artifacts in the non-rain regions, and it can remove the rain
structures in the rain regions. Also, visual quality evaluation confirms that
the proposed method outperforms the conventional texture and rain removal
methods.

 <dc:description>  Translating in real-time, a.k.a. simultaneous translation, outputs
translation words before the input sentence ends, which is a challenging
problem for conventional machine translation methods. We propose a neural
machine translation (NMT) framework for simultaneous translation in which an
agent learns to make decisions on when to translate from the interaction with a
pre-trained NMT environment. To trade off quality and delay, we extensively
explore various targets for delay and design a method for beam-search
applicable in the simultaneous MT setting. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines on two language pairs demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
framework both quantitatively and qualitatively.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the {\em polygon cloud}, also known as a polygon set or {\em
soup}, as a compressible representation of 3D geometry (including its
attributes, such as color texture) intermediate between polygonal meshes and
point clouds. Dynamic or time-varying polygon clouds, like dynamic polygonal
meshes and dynamic point clouds, can take advantage of temporal redundancy for
compression, if certain challenges are addressed. In this paper, we propose
methods for compressing both static and dynamic polygon clouds, specifically
triangle clouds. We compare triangle clouds to both triangle meshes and point
clouds in terms of compression, for live captured dynamic colored geometry. We
find that triangle clouds can be compressed nearly as well as triangle meshes,
while being far more robust to noise and other structures typically found in
live captures, which violate the assumption of a smooth surface manifold, such
as lines, points, and ragged boundaries. We also find that triangle clouds can
be used to compress point clouds with significantly better performance than
previously demonstrated point cloud compression methods. In particular, for
intra-frame coding of geometry, our method improves upon octree-based
intra-frame coding by a factor of 5-10 in bit rate. Inter-frame coding improves
this by another factor of 2-5. Overall, our dynamic triangle cloud compression
improves over the previous state-of-the-art in dynamic point cloud compression
by 33\% or more.

 <dc:title>Seeing into Darkness: Scotopic Visual Recognition</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Images are formed by counting how many photons traveling from a given set of
directions hit an image sensor during a given time interval. When photons are
few and far in between, the concept of `image' breaks down and it is best to
consider directly the flow of photons. Computer vision in this regime, which we
call `scotopic', is radically different from the classical image-based paradigm
in that visual computations (classification, control, search) have to take
place while the stream of photons is captured and decisions may be taken as
soon as enough information is available. The scotopic regime is important for
biomedical imaging, security, astronomy and many other fields. Here we develop
a framework that allows a machine to classify objects with as few photons as
possible, while maintaining the error rate below an acceptable threshold. A
dynamic and asymptotically optimal speed-accuracy tradeoff is a key feature of
this framework. We propose and study an algorithm to optimize the tradeoff of a
convolutional network directly from lowlight images and evaluate on simulated
images from standard datasets. Surprisingly, scotopic systems can achieve
comparable classification performance as traditional vision systems while using
less than 0.1% of the photons in a conventional image. In addition, we
demonstrate that our algorithms work even when the illuminance of the
environment is unknown and varying. Last, we outline a spiking neural network
coupled with photon-counting sensors as a power-efficient hardware realization
of scotopic algorithms.

 <dc:description>  In Fourier-based medical imaging, sampling below the Nyquist rate results in
an underdetermined system, in which linear reconstructions will exhibit
artifacts. Another consequence of under-sampling is lower signal to noise ratio
(SNR) due to fewer acquired measurements. Even if an oracle provided the
information to perfectly disambiguate the underdetermined system, the
reconstructed image could still have lower image quality than a corresponding
fully sampled acquisition because of the reduced measurement time. The effects
of lower SNR and the underdetermined system are coupled during reconstruction,
making it difficult to isolate the impact of lower SNR on image quality. To
this end, we present an image quality prediction process that reconstructs
fully sampled, fully determined data with noise added to simulate the loss of
SNR induced by a given under-sampling pattern. The resulting prediction image
empirically shows the effect of noise in under-sampled image reconstruction
without any effect from an underdetermined system.
  We discuss how our image quality prediction process can simulate the
distribution of noise for a given under-sampling pattern, including variable
density sampling that produces colored noise in the measurement data. An
interesting consequence of our prediction model is that we can show that
recovery from underdetermined non-uniform sampling is equivalent to a weighted
least squares optimization that accounts for heterogeneous noise levels across
measurements.
  Through a series of experiments with synthetic and in vivo datasets, we
demonstrate the efficacy of the image quality prediction process and show that
it provides a better estimation of reconstruction image quality than the
corresponding fully-sampled reference image.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This letter proposes a simple method of transferring rain structures of a
given exemplar rain image into a target image. Given the exemplar rain image
and its corresponding masked rain image, rain patches including rain structures
are extracted randomly, and then residual rain patches are obtained by
subtracting those rain patches from their mean patches. Next, residual rain
patches are selected randomly, and then added to the given target image along a
raster scanning direction. To decrease boundary artifacts around the added
patches on the target image, minimum error boundary cuts are found using
dynamic programming, and then blending is conducted between overlapping
patches. Our experiment shows that the proposed method can generate realistic
rain images that have similar rain structures in the exemplar images. Moreover,
it is expected that the proposed method can be used for rain removal. More
specifically, natural images and synthetic rain images generated via the
proposed method can be used to learn classifiers, for example, deep neural
networks, in a supervised manner.

a barcode using an infrared communication is implemented here, comprises of a
card on which a barcode is printed is illuminated with an infrared beam. The
reflections from the card are received by an infrared receiver and transmit
them to a remote machine over wireless channel where the retrieve information
is further processed and converted into the corresponding barcode digits which
are further matched against the database stored in the server and the
authenticity of the user is established. The system developed is

 <dc:description>  Many real-world problems involving constraints can be regarded as instances
of the Max-SAT problem, which is the optimization variant of the classic
satisfiability problem. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic
approach for Max-SAT called ProMS. Our algorithm relies on a stochastic local
search strategy using a novel probability distribution function with two
strategies for picking variables, one based on available information and
another purely random one. Moreover, while most previous algorithms based on
WalkSAT choose unsatisfied clauses randomly, we introduce a novel clause
selection strategy to improve our algorithm. Experimental results illustrate
that ProMS outperforms many state-of-the-art stochastic local search solvers on
hard unweighted random Max-SAT benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  We study algebraic synchronization trees, i.e., initial solutions of
algebraic recursion schemes over the continuous categorical algebra of
synchronization trees. In particular, we investigate the relative expressive
power of algebraic recursion schemes over two signatures, which are based on
those for Basic CCS and Basic Process Algebra, as a means for defining
synchronization trees up to isomorphism as well as modulo bisimilarity and
language equivalence. The expressiveness of algebraic recursion schemes is also
compared to that of the low levels in Caucal's pushdown hierarchy.

 <dc:title>Energy Efficient Restoring of Barrier Coverage in Wireless Sensor
  Networks Using Limited Mobility Sensors</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dash, Dinesh</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In Wireless Sensor Networks, sensors are used for tracking objects,
monitoring health and observing a region/territory for different environmental
parameters. Coverage problem in sensor network ensures quality of monitoring a
given region. Depending on applications different measures of coverage are
there. Barrier coverage is a type of coverage, which ensures all paths that
cross the boundary of a region intersect at least one sensor's sensing region.
The goal of the sensors is to detect intruders as they cross the boundary or as
they penetrate a protected area. The sensors are dependent on their battery
life. Restoring barrier coverage on sensor failure using mobile sensors with
minimum total displacement is the primary objective of this paper. A
centralized barrier coverage restoring scheme is proposed to increase the
robustness of the network. We formulate restoring barrier coverage as bipartite
matching problem. A distributed restoring of barrier coverage algorithm is also
proposed, which restores it by first finding existing alternate barrier. If
alternate barrier is not found, an alternate barrier is reconstructed by
shifting existing sensors in a cascaded manner. Detailed simulation results are
shown to evaluate the performance of our algorithms.

 <dc:title>Quantified-Self 2.0: Using Context-Aware Services for Promoting Gradual
  Behaviour Change</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Guo, Li</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The recent development of smartphone and wearable sensor technologies enable
general public to carry self-tracking tasks more easily. Much work has been
devoted to life data collection and visualisation to help people with better
self-understanding. We believe that although (awareness/knowledge discovery is
an important aspect of personal informatics, knowledge maintenance is more, or
at least equally, important. In this paper, we propose a proactive approach
that uses the knowledge mined from people's activity data to nudge them towards
a good lifestyle (better knowledge maintenance). For demonstration purpose, a
trial study was designed and implemented for good sleep maintenance. In the
study, we first use smartphones as activity trackers to collect various
features in a non-intrusive manner. We then use those data to learn users'
activity patterns, including daily step amount, app usages, bedding time,
wake-up time and sleep duration. Subsequently, we analyse correlations that may
have the positive or negative impact on users' sleep qualities and finally we
designed and implemented three proactive services that are able to generate
customised advice in the &quot;right&quot; context to nudge users towards a better
lifestyle. The experiments results are positive showing that with the use of
the proposed services 1. daily step amount have been increased by 3.03% on
average in a 10 days study and 2. sleep durations are increased by 7% for two
subjects.

 <dc:description>  In an ideal network, every packet would be attributable to its sender, while
host identities and transmitted content would remain private. Designing such a
network is challenging because source accountability and communication privacy
are typically viewed as conflicting properties. In this paper, we propose an
architecture that guarantees source accountability and privacy-preserving
communication by enlisting ISPs as accountability agents and privacy brokers.
While ISPs can link every packet in their network to their customers, customer
identity remains unknown to the rest of the Internet. In our architecture,
network communication is based on Ephemeral Identifiers
(EphIDs)---cryptographic tokens that can be linked to a source only by the
source's ISP. We demonstrate that EphIDs can be generated and processed
efficiently, and we analyze the practical considerations for deployment.

 <dc:description>  Perturb and Combine (P&amp;C) group of methods generate multiple versions of the
predictor by perturbing the training set or construction and then combining
them into a single predictor (Breiman, 1996b). The motive is to improve the
accuracy in unstable classification and regression methods. One of the most
well known method in this group is Bagging. Arcing or Adaptive Resampling and
Combining methods like AdaBoost are smarter variants of P&amp;C methods. In this
extended abstract, we lay the groundwork for a new family of methods under the
P&amp;C umbrella, known as Evolutionary Sampling (ES). We employ Evolutionary
algorithms to suggest smarter sampling in both the feature space (sub-spaces)
as well as training samples. We discuss multiple fitness functions to assess
ensembles and empirically compare our performance against randomized sampling
of training data and feature sub-spaces.

 <dc:description>  Notes in a musical piece are building blocks employed in non-random ways to
create melodies. It is the &quot;interaction&quot; among a limited amount of notes that
allows constructing the variety of musical compositions that have been written
in centuries and within different cultures. Networks are a modeling tool that
is commonly employed to represent a set of entities interacting in some way.
Thus, notes composing a melody can be seen as nodes of a network that are
connected whenever these are played in sequence. The outcome of such a process
results in a directed graph. By using complex network theory, some main metrics
of musical graphs can be measured, which characterize the related musical
pieces. In this paper, we define a framework to represent melodies as networks.
Then, we provide an analysis on a set of guitar solos performed by main
musicians. Results of this study indicate that the presented model can have an
impact on audio and multimedia applications such as music classification,
identification, e-learning, automatic music generation, multimedia
entertainment.

 <dc:title>A new kernel-based approach to system identification with quantized

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce a novel method for linear system identification
with quantized output data. We model the impulse response as a zero-mean
Gaussian process whose covariance (kernel) is given by the recently proposed
stable spline kernel, which encodes information on regularity and exponential
stability. This serves as a starting point to cast our system identification
problem into a Bayesian framework. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods
to provide an estimate of the system. In particular, we design two methods
based on the so-called Gibbs sampler that allow also to estimate the kernel
hyperparameters by marginal likelihood maximization via the
expectation-maximization method. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness
of the proposed scheme, as compared to the state-of-the-art kernel-based
methods when these are employed in system identification with quantized data.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the first generic text representation model that is completely
nonsymbolic, i.e., it does not require the availability of a segmentation or
tokenization method that attempts to identify words or other symbolic units in
text. This applies to training the parameters of the model on a training corpus
as well as to applying it when computing the representation of a new text. We
show that our model performs better than prior work on an information

 <dc:title>Pooling Hybrid Representations for Web Structured Data Annotation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Automatically identifying data types of web structured data is a key step in
the process of web data integration. Web structured data is usually associated
with entities or objects in a particular domain. In this paper, we aim to map
attributes of an entity in a given domain to pre-specified classes of
attributes in the same domain based on their values. To perform this task, we
propose a hybrid deep learning network that relies on the format of the
attributes' values. It does so without any pre-processing or using pre-defined
hand-crafted features. The hybrid network combines sequence-based neural
networks, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural
networks (RNN), to learn the sequence structure of attributes' values. The CNN
captures short-distance dependencies in these sequences through a sliding
window approach, and the RNN captures long-distance dependencies by storing
information of previous characters. These networks create different vector
representations of the input sequence which are combined using a pooling layer.
This layer applies a specific operation on these vectors in order to capture
their most useful patterns for the task. Finally, on top of the pooling layer,
a softmax function predicts the label of a given attribute value. We evaluate
our strategy in four different web domains. The results show that the pooling
network outperforms previous approaches, which use some kind of input
pre-processing, in all domains.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of efficient &quot;on the fly&quot; tuning of existing, or {\it
legacy}, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. The legacy AI systems are
allowed to be of arbitrary class, albeit the data they are using for computing
interim or final decision responses should posses an underlying structure of a
high-dimensional topological real vector space. The tuning method that we
propose enables dealing with errors without the need to re-train the system.
Instead of re-training a simple cascade of perceptron nodes is added to the
legacy system. The added cascade modulates the AI legacy system's decisions. If
applied repeatedly, the process results in a network of modulating rules
&quot;dressing up&quot; and improving performance of existing AI systems. Mathematical
rationale behind the method is based on the fundamental property of measure
concentration in high dimensional spaces. The method is illustrated with an
example of fine-tuning a deep convolutional network that has been pre-trained
to detect pedestrians in images.

 <dc:description>  Many security and software testing applications require checking whether
certain properties of a program hold for any possible usage scenario. For
instance, a tool for identifying software vulnerabilities may need to rule out
the existence of any backdoor to bypass a program's authentication. One
approach would be to test the program using different, possibly random inputs.
As the backdoor may only be hit for very specific program workloads, automated
exploration of the space of possible inputs is of the essence. Symbolic
execution provides an elegant solution to the problem, by systematically
exploring many possible execution paths at the same time without necessarily
requiring concrete inputs. Rather than taking on fully specified input values,
the technique abstractly represents them as symbols, resorting to constraint
solvers to construct actual instances that would cause property violations.
Symbolic execution has been incubated in dozens of tools developed over the
last four decades, leading to major practical breakthroughs in a number of
prominent software reliability applications. The goal of this survey is to
provide an overview of the main ideas, challenges, and solutions developed in
the area, distilling them for a broad audience.

 <dc:description>  In phylogenetics, the consensus problem consists in summarizing a set of
phylogenetic trees that all classify the same set of species into a single
tree. Several definitions of consensus exist in the literature; in this paper
we focus on the Weighted Quartet Consensus problem, a problem with unknown
complexity status so far. Here we prove that the Weighted Quartet Consensus
problem is NP-hard and we give a 1/2-factor approximation for this problem.
During the process, we propose a derandomization procedure of a previously
known randomized 1/3-factor approximation. We also investigate the
fixed-parameter tractability of this problem.

 <dc:description>  We propose the application of a semi-supervised learning method to improve
the performance of acoustic modelling for automatic speech recognition based on
deep neural net- works. As opposed to unsupervised initialisation followed by
supervised fine tuning, our method takes advantage of both unlabelled and
labelled data simultaneously through mini- batch stochastic gradient descent.
We tested the method with varying proportions of labelled vs unlabelled
observations in frame-based phoneme classification on the TIMIT database. Our
experiments show that the method outperforms standard supervised training for
an equal amount of labelled data and provides competitive error rates compared
to state-of-the-art graph-based semi-supervised learning techniques.

 <dc:description>  We propose a probabilistic video model, the Video Pixel Network (VPN), that
estimates the discrete joint distribution of the raw pixel values in a video.
The model and the neural architecture reflect the time, space and color
structure of video tensors and encode it as a four-dimensional dependency
chain. The VPN approaches the best possible performance on the Moving MNIST
benchmark, a leap over the previous state of the art, and the generated videos
show only minor deviations from the ground truth. The VPN also produces
detailed samples on the action-conditional Robotic Pushing benchmark and
generalizes to the motion of novel objects.

 <dc:description>  We present a policy search method for learning complex feedback control
policies that map from high-dimensional sensory inputs to motor torques, for
manipulation tasks with discontinuous contact dynamics. We build on a prior
technique called guided policy search (GPS), which iteratively optimizes a set
of local policies for specific instances of a task, and uses these to train a
complex, high-dimensional global policy that generalizes across task instances.
We extend GPS in the following ways: (1) we propose the use of a model-free
local optimizer based on path integral stochastic optimal control (PI2), which
enables us to learn local policies for tasks with highly discontinuous contact
dynamics; and (2) we enable GPS to train on a new set of task instances in
every iteration by using on-policy sampling: this increases the diversity of
the instances that the policy is trained on, and is crucial for achieving good
generalization. We show that these contributions enable us to learn deep neural
network policies that can directly perform torque control from visual input. We
validate the method on a challenging door opening task and a pick-and-place
task, and we demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms the prior
LQR-based local policy optimizer on these tasks. Furthermore, we show that
on-policy sampling significantly increases the generalization ability of these
policies.

 <dc:description>  For a finite group $G$ and a finite set $A$, we study various algebraic
aspects of cellular automata over the configuration space $A^G$. In this
situation, the set $\text{CA}(G;A)$ of all cellular automata over $A^G$ is a
finite monoid whose basic algebraic properties had remained unknown. First, we
investigate the structure of the group of units $\text{ICA}(G;A)$ of
$\text{CA}(G;A)$. We obtain a decomposition of $\text{ICA}(G;A)$ into a direct
product of wreath products of groups that depends on the numbers $\alpha_{[H]}$
of periodic configurations for conjugacy classes $[H]$ of subgroups of $G$. We
show how the numbers $\alpha_{[H]}$ may be computed using the M\&quot;obius function
of the subgroup lattice of $G$, and we use this to improve the lower bound
recently found by Gao, Jackson and Seward on the number of aperiodic
configurations of $A^G$. Furthermore, we study generating sets of
$\text{CA}(G;A)$; in particular, we prove that $\text{CA}(G;A)$ cannot be
generated by cellular automata with small memory set, and, when all subgroups
of $G$ are normal, we determine the relative rank of $\text{ICA}(G;A)$ on
$\text{CA}(G;A)$, i.e. the minimal size of a set $V \subseteq \text{CA}(G;A)$
such that $\text{CA}(G;A) = \langle \text{ICA}(G;A) \cup V \rangle$.

 <dc:description>  We present an extension of a theorem by Michael Drmota and Michele Soria
[Images and Preimages in Random Mappings, 1997] which can be used to identify
the limiting distribution for a class of combinatorial schemata. This is
achieved by determining analytic and algebraic properties of the associated
bivariate generating function. We give sufficient conditions implying a
half-normal limiting distribution, extending the known conditions leading to
either a Rayleigh, a Gaussian, or a convolution of the last two distributions.
We conclude with three natural appearances of such a limiting distribution in
the domain of lattice paths.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a neural network based real-time speech recognition (SR)
system is developed using an FPGA for very low-power operation. The implemented
system employs two recurrent neural networks (RNNs); one is a
speech-to-character RNN for acoustic modeling (AM) and the other is for
character-level language modeling (LM). The system also employs a statistical
word-level LM to improve the recognition accuracy. The results of the AM, the
character-level LM, and the word-level LM are combined using a fairly simple
N-best search algorithm instead of the hidden Markov model (HMM) based network.
The RNNs are implemented using massively parallel processing elements (PEs) for
low latency and high throughput. The weights are quantized to 6 bits to store
all of them in the on-chip memory of an FPGA. The proposed algorithm is
implemented on a Xilinx XC7Z045, and the system can operate much faster than
real-time.

 <dc:description>  We consider a system of processor-sharing queues with state-dependent service
rates. These are allocated according to balanced fairness within a polymatroid
capacity set. Balanced fairness is known to be both insensitive and
Pareto-efficient in such systems, which ensures that the performance metrics,
when computable, will provide robust insights into the real performance of the
system considered. We first show that these performance metrics can be
evaluated with a complexity that is polynomial in the system size if the system
is partitioned into a finite number of parts, so that queues are exchangeable
within each part and asymmetric across different parts. This in turn allows us
to derive stochastic bounds for a larger class of systems which satisfy less
restrictive symmetry assumptions. These results are applied to practical
examples of tree data networks, such as backhaul networks of Internet service
providers, and computer clusters.

parity games over graphs of bounded tree-width, where updates may add or delete
edges, or change the owner or color of states. We show that this problem is in
DynFO (with LOGSPACE precomputation); this is achieved by a reduction to a

 <dc:description>  Due to rapid development of the Internet, recent years have witnessed an
explosion in the rate of data generation. Dealing with data at current scales
brings up unprecedented challenges. From the algorithmic view point, executing
existing linear algorithms in information retrieval and machine learning on
such tremendous amounts of data incur intolerable computational and storage
costs. To address this issue, there is a growing interest to map data points in
large-scale datasets to binary codes. This can significantly reduce the storage
complexity of large-scale datasets. However, one of the most compelling reasons
for using binary codes or any discrete representation is that they can be used
as direct indices into a hash table. Incorporating hash table offers fast query
execution; one can look up the nearby buckets in a hash table populated with
binary codes to retrieve similar items. Nonetheless, if binary codes are
compared in terms of the cosine similarity rather than the Hamming distance,
there is no fast exact sequential procedure to find the $K$ closest items to
the query other than the exhaustive search. Given a large dataset of binary
codes and a binary query, the problem that we address is to efficiently find
$K$ closest codes in the dataset that yield the largest cosine similarities to
the query. To handle this issue, we first elaborate on the relation between the
Hamming distance and the cosine similarity. This allows finding the sequence of
buckets to check in the hash table. Having this sequence, we propose a
multi-index hashing approach that can increase the search speed up to orders of
magnitude in comparison to the exhaustive search and even approximation methods
such as LSH. We empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm
on real world datasets.

 <dc:description>  Detecting and quantifying anomalies in urban traffic is critical for
real-time alerting or re-routing in the short run and urban planning in the
long run. We describe a two-step framework that achieves these two goals in a
robust, fast, online, and unsupervised manner. First, we adapt stable principal
component pursuit to detect anomalies for each road segment. This allows us to
pinpoint traffic anomalies early and precisely in space. Then we group the
road-level anomalies across time and space into meaningful anomaly events using
a simple graph expansion procedure. These events can be easily clustered,
visualized, and analyzed by urban planners. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our system using 7 weeks of anonymized and aggregated cellular location data in
Dallas-Fort Worth. We suggest potential opportunities for urban planners and
policy makers to use our methodology to make informed changes. These
applications include real-time re-routing of traffic in response to abnormally
high traffic, or identifying candidates for high-impact infrastructure
projects.

 <dc:description>  Recovery from the Flint Water Crisis has been hindered by uncertainty in both
the water testing process and the causes of contamination. In this work, we
develop an ensemble of predictive models to assess the risk of lead
contamination in individual homes and neighborhoods. To train these models, we
utilize a wide range of data sources, including voluntary residential water
tests, historical records, and city infrastructure data. Additionally, we use
our models to identify the most prominent factors that contribute to a high
risk of lead contamination. In this analysis, we find that lead service lines
are not the only factor that is predictive of the risk of lead contamination of
water. These results could be used to guide the long-term recovery efforts in
Flint, minimize the immediate damages, and improve resource-allocation
decisions for similar water infrastructure crises.

 <dc:description>  We study space and time efficient quantum algorithms for two graph problems
-- deciding whether an $n$-vertex graph is a forest, and whether it is
bipartite. Via a reduction to the s-t connectivity problem, we describe quantum
algorithms for deciding both properties in $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ time and using
$O(\log n)$ classical and quantum bits of storage in the adjacency matrix
model. We then present quantum algorithms for deciding the two properties in
the adjacency array model, which run in time $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{d_m})$ and also
require $O(\log n)$ space, where $d_m$ is the maximum degree of any vertex in
the input graph.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we describe a system for generating three-dimensional visual
simulations of natural language motion expressions. We use a rich formal model
of events and their participants to generate simulations that satisfy the
minimal constraints entailed by the associated utterance, relying on semantic
knowledge of physical objects and motion events. This paper outlines technical
considerations and discusses implementing the aforementioned semantic models
into such a system.

 <dc:title>Congestion Control for Network-Aware Telehaptic Communication</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Telehaptic applications involve delay-sensitive multimedia communication
between remote locations with distinct Quality of Service (QoS) requirements
for different media components. These QoS constraints pose a variety of
challenges, especially when the communication occurs over a shared network,
with unknown and time-varying cross-traffic. In this work, we propose a
transport layer congestion control protocol for telehaptic applications
operating over shared networks, termed as dynamic packetization module (DPM).
DPM is a lossless, network-aware protocol which tunes the telehaptic
packetization rate based on the level of congestion in the network. To monitor
the network congestion, we devise a novel network feedback module, which
communicates the end-to-end delays encountered by the telehaptic packets to the
respective transmitters with negligible overhead. Via extensive simulations, we
show that DPM meets the QoS requirements of telehaptic applications over a wide
range of network cross-traffic conditions. We also report qualitative results
of a real-time telepottery experiment with several human subjects, which reveal
that DPM preserves the quality of telehaptic activity even under heavily
congested network scenarios. Finally, we compare the performance of DPM with
several previously proposed telehaptic communication protocols and demonstrate
that DPM outperforms these protocols.

 <dc:title>FogMQ: A Message Broker System for Enabling Distributed, Internet-Scale
  IoT Applications over Heterogeneous Cloud Platforms</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Excessive tail end-to-end latency occurs with conventional message brokers as
a result of having massive numbers of geographically distributed devices
communicate through a message broker. On the other hand, broker-less messaging
systems, though ensure low latency, are highly dependent on the limitation of
direct device-to-device (D2D) communication technologies, and cannot scale well
as large numbers of resource-limited devices exchange messages. In this paper,
we propose FogMQ, a cloud-based message broker system that overcomes the
limitations of conventional systems by enabling autonomous discovery,
self-deployment, and online migration of message brokers across heterogeneous
cloud platforms. For each device, FogMQ provides a high capacity device cloning
service that subscribes to device messages. The clones facilitate near-the-edge
data analytics in resourceful cloud compute nodes. Clones in FogMQ apply Flock,
an algorithm mimicking flocking-like behavior to allow clones to dynamically
select and autonomously migrate to different heterogeneous cloud platforms in a
distributed manner.

 <dc:description>  Enterprises are investing heavily in cloud data centers to meet the ever
surging business demand. Data Center is a facility, which houses computer
systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage
systems. It generally includes power supply equipment, communication
connections and cooling equipment. A large data center can use as much
electricity as a small town. Due to the emergence of data center based
computing services, it has become necessary to examine how the costs associated
with data centers evolve over time, mainly in view of efficiency issues. We
have presented a quasi form of Cobb Douglas model, which addresses revenue and
profit issues in running large data centers. The stochastic form has been
introduced and explored along with the quasi Cobb Douglas model to understand
the behavior of the model in depth. Harrod neutrality and Solow neutrality are
incorporated in the model to identify the technological progress in cloud data
centers. This allows us to shed light on the stochastic uncertainty of cloud
data center operations. A general approach to optimizing the revenue cost of
data centers using Cobb Douglas Stochastic Frontier Analysis,CDSFA is
presented. Next, we develop the optimization model for large data centers. The
mathematical basis of CDSFA has been utilized for cost optimization and profit
maximization in data centers. The results are found to be quite useful in view
of production reorganization in large data centers around the world.

 <dc:description>  Not long ago, it was thought that only software applications and general
purpose digital systems i.e. computers were prone to various types of attacks
against their security. The underlying hardware, hardware implementations of
these software applications, embedded systems, and hardware devices were
considered to be secure and out of reach of these attacks. However, during the
previous few years, it has been demonstrated that novel attacks against the
hardware and embedded systems can also be mounted. Not only viruses, but worms
and Trojan horses have been developed for them, and they have also been
demonstrated to be effective. Whereas a lot of research has already been done
in the area of security of general purpose computers and software applications,
hardware and embedded systems security is a relatively new and emerging area of
research. This chapter provides details of various types of existing attacks
against hardware devices and embedded systems, analyzes existing design
methodologies for their vulnerability to new types of attacks, and along the
way describes solutions and countermeasures against them for the design and
development of secure systems.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning holds the promise of enabling autonomous robots to
learn large repertoires of behavioral skills with minimal human intervention.
However, robotic applications of reinforcement learning often compromise the
autonomy of the learning process in favor of achieving training times that are
practical for real physical systems. This typically involves introducing
hand-engineered policy representations and human-supplied demonstrations. Deep
reinforcement learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose
neural network policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning
algorithms have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively
simple tasks, due to their apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we
demonstrate that a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on
off-policy training of deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D manipulation
tasks and can learn deep neural network policies efficiently enough to train on
real physical robots. We demonstrate that the training times can be further
reduced by parallelizing the algorithm across multiple robots which pool their
policy updates asynchronously. Our experimental evaluation shows that our
method can learn a variety of 3D manipulation skills in simulation and a
complex door opening skill on real robots without any prior demonstrations or
manually designed representations.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There is no denying the fact that with the widespread usage of computers and
the Internet in our daily lives, security of information and data has gained
increased attention. Information stored in electronic form is more susceptible
to being leaked to unauthorized individuals intentionally or without intent.
One of the major reasons for this breach of security has been attributed to
proprietary software whose source is available only to the company which made
it. Thus you have no surety that the proprietary and pre-compiled software has
no hole to help an individual break security of your computer or network.
Philosophy of free and open source software as against this provides everyone
an opportunity to view the source code for any possible vulnerabilities and
compile and change it according to ones need. This paper discusses this
philosophy in length with some examples and also some open source tools that
help maintain computer and Internet security.

 <dc:title>Speech Enhancement via Two-Stage Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Packet
  Transform with a Speech Presence Probability Estimator</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sun, Pengfei</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Qin, Jun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a two-stage dual tree complex wavelet packet transform
(DTCWPT) based speech enhancement algorithm has been proposed, in which a
speech presence probability (SPP) estimator and a generalized minimum mean
squared error (MMSE) estimator are developed. To overcome the drawback of
signal distortions caused by down sampling of WPT, a two-stage analytic
decomposition concatenating undecimated WPT (UWPT) and decimated WPT is
employed. An SPP estimator in the DTCWPT domain is derived based on a
generalized Gamma distribution of speech, and Gaussian noise assumption. The
validation results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain enhanced
perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), and segmental signal-to-noise
ratio (SegSNR) at low SNR nonstationary noise, compared with other four
state-of-the-art speech enhancement algorithms, including optimally modified
LSA (OM-LSA), soft masking using a posteriori SNR uncertainty (SMPO), a
posteriori SPP based MMSE estimation (MMSE-SPP), and adaptive Bayesian wavelet
thresholding (BWT).

 <dc:description>  In future practical deployments of massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
systems, the number of radio frequency (RF) chains at the base stations (BSs)
may be much smaller than the number of BS antennas to reduce the overall
expenditure. In this paper, we propose a novel design framework for joint data
and artificial noise (AN) precoding in a multiuser massive MIMO system with
limited number of RF chains, which improves the wireless security performance.
With imperfect channel state information (CSI), we analytically derive an
achievable lower bound on the ergodic secrecy rate of any mobile terminal (MT),
for both analog and hybrid precoding schemes. The closed-form lower bound is
used to determine optimal power splitting between data and AN that maximizes
the secrecy rate through simple one-dimensional search. Analytical and
numerical results together reveal that the proposed hybrid precoder, although
suffers from reduced secrecy rate compared with theoretical full-dimensional
precoder, is free of the high computational complexity of large-scale matrix
inversion and null-space calculations, and largely reduces the hardware cost.

 <dc:title>Distributionally Robust Games with Risk-averse Players</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Loizou, Nicolas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a new model of incomplete information games without private
information in which the players use a distributionally robust optimization
approach to cope with the payoff uncertainty. With some specific restrictions,
we show that our &quot;Distributionally Robust Game&quot; constitutes a true
generalization of three popular finite games. These are the Complete
Information Games, Bayesian Games and Robust Games. Subsequently, we prove that
the set of equilibria of an arbitrary distributionally robust game with
specified ambiguity set can be computed as the component-wise projection of the
solution set of a multi-linear system of equations and inequalities. For
special cases of such games we show equivalence to complete information finite
games (Nash Games) with the same number of players and same action spaces.
Thus, when our game falls within these special cases one can simply solve the
corresponding Nash Game. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our new
model of games and highlight its importance.

 <dc:description>  Contemporary technological challenges often involve many degrees of freedom
in a distributed or networked setting. Three aspects are notable: the variables
are usually associated with the nodes of a graph with limited communication
resources, hindering centralized control; the communication is subjected to
noise; and the number of variables can be very large. These three aspects make
tools and techniques from statistical physics particularly suitable for the
performance analysis of such networked systems in the limit of many variables
(analogous to the thermodynamic limit in statistical physics). Perhaps not
surprisingly, phase-transition like phenomena appear in these systems, where a
sharp change in performance can be observed with a smooth parameter variation,
with the change becoming discontinuous or singular in the limit of infinite
system size. In this paper we analyze the so called network consensus problem,
prototypical of the above considerations, that has been previously analyzed
mostly in the context of additive noise. We show that qualitatively new
phase-transition like phenomena appear for this problem in the presence of
multiplicative noise. Depending on dimensions and on the presence or absence of
a conservation law, the system performance shows a discontinuous change at a
threshold value of the multiplicative noise strength. In the absence of the
conservation law, and for graph spectral dimension less than two, the
multiplicative noise threshold (the stability margin of the control problem) is
zero. This is reminiscent of the absence of robust controllers for certain
classes of centralized control problems. Although our study involves a toy
model we believe that the qualitative features are generic, with implication
for the robust stability of distributed control systems, as well as the effect
of roundoff errors and communication noise on distributed algorithms.

 <dc:description>  In the context of the global obesity epidemic, it is important to know who
becomes obese and why. However, the processes that determine the changing shape
of Body Mass Index (BMI) distributions in high-income societies are not
well-understood. Here we establish the statistical mechanics of human weight
change, providing a fundamental new understanding of human weight
distributions. By compiling and analysing the largest data set so far of
year-over-year BMI changes, we find, strikingly, that heavy people on average
strongly decrease their weight year-over-year, and light people increase their
weight. This drift towards the centre of the BMI distribution is balanced by
diffusion resulting from random fluctuations in diet and physical activity that
are, notably, proportional in size to BMI. We formulate a stochastic
mathematical model for BMI dynamics, deriving a theoretical shape for the BMI
distribution and offering a mechanism to explain the ongoing right-skewed
broadening of BMI distributions over time. The model also provides new
quantitative support for the hypothesis that peer-to-peer social influence
plays a measurable role in BMI dynamics. More broadly, our results demonstrate
a remarkable analogy with drift-diffusion mechanisms that are well-known from
the physical sciences and finance.

 <dc:title>Kernel Selection using Multiple Kernel Learning and Domain Adaptation in
  Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, for Face Recognition under Surveillance
  Scenario</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Face Recognition (FR) has been the interest to several researchers over the
past few decades due to its passive nature of biometric authentication. Despite
high accuracy achieved by face recognition algorithms under controlled
conditions, achieving the same performance for face images obtained in
surveillance scenarios, is a major hurdle. Some attempts have been made to
super-resolve the low-resolution face images and improve the contrast, without
considerable degree of success. The proposed technique in this paper tries to
cope with the very low resolution and low contrast face images obtained from
surveillance cameras, for FR under surveillance conditions. For Support Vector
Machine classification, the selection of appropriate kernel has been a widely
discussed issue in the research community. In this paper, we propose a novel
kernel selection technique termed as MFKL (Multi-Feature Kernel Learning) to
obtain the best feature-kernel pairing. Our proposed technique employs a
effective kernel selection by Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) method, to choose
the optimal kernel to be used along with unsupervised domain adaptation method
in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), for a solution to the problem.
Rigorous experimentation has been performed on three real-world surveillance
face datasets : FR\_SURV, SCface and ChokePoint. Results have been shown using
Rank-1 Recognition Accuracy, ROC and CMC measures. Our proposed method
outperforms all other recent state-of-the-art techniques by a considerable
margin.

 <dc:description>  Obtaining high quality sensor information is critical in vehicular
emergencies. However, existing standards such as IEEE 802.11p/DSRC and LTE-A
cannot support either the required data rates or the latency requirements. One
solution to this problem is for municipalities to invest in dedicated base
stations to ensure that drivers have the information they need to make safe
decisions in or near accidents. In this paper we further propose that these
municipality-owned base stations form a Single Frequency Network (SFN). In
order to ensure that transmissions are reliable, we derive tight bounds on the
outage probability when the SFN is overlaid on an existing cellular network.
Using our bounds, we propose a transmission power allocation algorithm. We show
that our power allocation model can reduce the total instantaneous SFN
transmission power up to $20$ times compared to a static uniform power
allocation solution, for the considered scenarios. The result is particularly
important when base stations rely on an off-grid power source (i.e.,
batteries).

 <dc:title>Privacy-guaranteed Two-Agent Interactions Using Information-Theoretic

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a multi-round interaction problem with privacy
constraints between two agents that observe correlated data. The agents
alternately share data with one another for a total of K rounds such that each
agent initiates sharing over K/2 rounds. The interactions are modeled as a
collection of K random mechanisms (mappings), one for each round. The goal is
to jointly design the K private mechanisms to determine the set of all
achievable distortion-leakage pairs at each agent. Arguing that a mutual
information-based leakage metric can be appropriate for streaming data
settings, this paper: (i) determines the set of all achievable distortion-
leakage tuples ; (ii) shows that the K mechanisms allow for precisely composing
the total privacy budget over K rounds without loss; and (ii) develops
conditions under which interaction reduces the net leakage at both agents and
illustrates it for a specific class of sources. The paper then focuses on
log-loss distortion to better understand the effect on leakage of using a
commonly used utility metric in learning theory. The resulting interaction
problem leads to a non-convex sum-leakage-distortion optimization problem that
can be viewed as an interactive version of the information bottleneck problem.
A new merge-and-search algorithm that extends the classical agglomerative
information bottleneck algorithm to the interactive setting is introduced to
determine a provable locally optimal solution. Finally, the benefit of
interaction under log-loss is illustrated for specific source classes and the
optimality of one-shot is proved for Gaussian sources under both mean-square
and log-loss distortions constraints.

 <dc:description>  Synthetic graph generators facilitate research in graph algorithms and
processing systems by providing access to data, for instance, graphs resembling
social networks, while circumventing privacy and security concerns.
Nevertheless, their practical value lies in their ability to capture important
metrics of real graphs, such as degree distribution and clustering properties.
Graph generators must also be able to produce such graphs at the scale of
real-world industry graphs, that is, hundreds of billions or trillions of
edges.
  In this paper, we propose Darwini, a graph generator that captures a number
of core characteristics of real graphs. Importantly, given a source graph, it
can reproduce the degree distribution and, unlike existing approaches, the
local clustering coefficient and joint-degree distributions. Furthermore,
Darwini maintains metrics such node PageRank, eigenvalues and the K-core
decomposition of a source graph. Comparing Darwini with state-of-the-art
generative models, we show that it can reproduce these characteristics more
accurately. Finally, we provide an open source implementation of our approach
on the vertex-centric Apache Giraph model that allows us to create synthetic
graphs with one trillion edges.

 <dc:description>  In principle, reinforcement learning and policy search methods can enable
robots to learn highly complex and general skills that may allow them to
function amid the complexity and diversity of the real world. However, training
a policy that generalizes well across a wide range of real-world conditions
requires far greater quantity and diversity of experience than is practical to
collect with a single robot. Fortunately, it is possible for multiple robots to
share their experience with one another, and thereby, learn a policy
collectively. In this work, we explore distributed and asynchronous policy
learning as a means to achieve generalization and improved training times on
challenging, real-world manipulation tasks. We propose a distributed and
asynchronous version of Guided Policy Search and use it to demonstrate
collective policy learning on a vision-based door opening task using four
robots. We show that it achieves better generalization, utilization, and
training times than the single robot alternative.

 <dc:description>  We construct team-optimal estimation algorithms over distributed networks for
state estimation in the finite-horizon mean-square error (MSE) sense. Here, we
have a distributed collection of agents with processing and cooperation
capabilities. These agents observe noisy samples of a desired state through a
linear model and seek to learn this state by interacting with each other.
Although this problem has attracted significant attention and been studied
extensively in fields including machine learning and signal processing, all the
well-known strategies do not achieve team-optimal learning performance in the
finite-horizon MSE sense. To this end, we formulate the finite-horizon
distributed minimum MSE (MMSE) when there is no restriction on the size of the
disclosed information, i.e., oracle performance, over an arbitrary network
topology. Subsequently, we show that exchange of local estimates is sufficient
to achieve the oracle performance only over certain network topologies. By
inspecting these network structures, we propose recursive algorithms achieving
the oracle performance through the disclosure of local estimates. For practical
implementations we also provide approaches to reduce the complexity of the
algorithms through the time-windowing of the observations. Finally, in the
numerical examples, we demonstrate the superior performance of the introduced
algorithms in the finite-horizon MSE sense due to optimal estimation.

 <dc:description>  High-Throughput materials discovery involves the rapid synthesis,
measurement, and characterization of many different but structurally-related
materials. A key problem in materials discovery, the phase map identification
problem, involves the determination of the crystal phase diagram from the
materials' composition and structural characterization data. We present
Phase-Mapper, a novel AI platform to solve the phase map identification problem
that allows humans to interact with both the data and products of AI
algorithms, including the incorporation of human feedback to constrain or
initialize solutions. Phase-Mapper affords incorporation of any spectral
demixing algorithm, including our novel solver, AgileFD, which is based on a
convolutive non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. AgileFD can
incorporate constraints to capture the physics of the materials as well as
human feedback. We compare three solver variants with previously proposed
methods in a large-scale experiment involving 20 synthetic systems,
demonstrating the efficacy of imposing physical constrains using AgileFD.
Phase-Mapper has also been used by materials scientists to solve a wide variety
of phase diagrams, including the previously unsolved Nb-Mn-V oxide system,
which is provided here as an illustrative example.

 <dc:description>  A key challenge in scaling up robot learning to many skills and environments
is removing the need for human supervision, so that robots can collect their
own data and improve their own performance without being limited by the cost of
requesting human feedback. Model-based reinforcement learning holds the promise
of enabling an agent to learn to predict the effects of its actions, which
could provide flexible predictive models for a wide range of tasks and
environments, without detailed human supervision. We develop a method for
combining deep action-conditioned video prediction models with model-predictive
control that uses entirely unlabeled training data. Our approach does not
require a calibrated camera, an instrumented training set-up, nor precise
sensing and actuation. Our results show that our method enables a real robot to
perform nonprehensile manipulation -- pushing objects -- and can handle novel
objects not seen during training.

 <dc:title>Footstep and Motion Planning in Semi-unstructured Environments Using
  Randomized Possibility Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Traversing environments with arbitrary obstacles poses significant challenges
for bipedal robots. In some cases, whole body motions may be necessary to
maneuver around an obstacle, but most existing footstep planners can only
select from a discrete set of predetermined footstep actions; they are unable
to utilize the continuum of whole body motion that is truly available to the
robot platform. Existing motion planners that can utilize whole body motion
tend to struggle with the complexity of large-scale problems. We introduce a
planning method, called the &quot;Randomized Possibility Graph&quot;, which uses
high-level approximations of constraint manifolds to rapidly explore the
&quot;possibility&quot; of actions, thereby allowing lower-level motion planners to be
utilized more efficiently. We demonstrate simulations of the method working in
a variety of semi-unstructured environments. In this context,
&quot;semi-unstructured&quot; means the walkable terrain is flat and even, but there are
arbitrary 3D obstacles throughout the environment which may need to be stepped
over or maneuvered around using whole body motions.

 <dc:description>  Locomotion for legged robots poses considerable challenges when confronted by
obstacles and adverse environments. Footstep planners are typically only
designed for one mode of locomotion, but traversing unfavorable environments
may require several forms of locomotion to be sequenced together, such as
walking, crawling, and jumping. Multi-modal motion planners can be used to
address some of these problems, but existing implementations tend to be
time-consuming and are limited to quasi-static actions. This paper presents a
motion planning method to traverse complex environments using multiple
categories of continuous actions. To this end, this paper formulates and
exploits the Possibility Graph---which uses high-level approximations of
constraint manifolds to rapidly explore the &quot;possibility&quot; of actions---to
utilize lower-level single-action motion planners more effectively. We show
that the Possibility Graph can quickly find routes through several different
challenging environments which require various combinations of actions in order
to traverse.

 <dc:title>A thermodynamic approach to nonlinear ultrasonics for material state
  awareness and prognosis</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We develop a thermodynamic framework for modeling nonlinear ultrasonic damage
sensing and prognosis in materials undergoing progressive damage. The framework
is based on the internal variable approach and relies on the construction of a
pseudo-elastic strain energy function that captures the energetics associated
with the damage progression. The pseudo-elastic strain energy function is
composed of two energy functions - one that describes how a material stores
energy in an elastic fashion and the other describes how material dissipates
energy or stores it in an inelastic fashion. Experimental motivation for the
choice of the above two functionals is discussed and some specific choices
pertaining to damage progression during fatigue and creep are presented. The
thermodynamic framework is employed to model the nonlinear response of material
undergoing stress relaxation and creep-like degradation. For each of the above
cases, evolution of the nonlinearity parameter with damage as well as with
macroscopic measurables like accumulated plastic strain are obtained.

 <dc:title>Complexity of Left-Ideal, Suffix-Closed and Suffix-Free Regular

 <dc:description>  A language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is suffix-convex if, for any words
$x,y,z\in\Sigma^*$, whenever $z$ and $xyz$ are in $L$, then so is $yz$.
Suffix-convex languages include three special cases: left-ideal, suffix-closed,
and suffix-free languages. We examine complexity properties of these three
special classes of suffix-convex regular languages. In particular, we study the
quotient/state complexity of boolean operations, product (concatenation), star,
and reversal on these languages, as well as the size of their syntactic
semigroups, and the quotient complexity of their atoms.
