 <dc:title>Decidability of Non-Interactive Simulation of Joint Distributions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present decidability results for a sub-class of &quot;non-interactive&quot;
simulation problems, a well-studied class of problems in information theory. A
non-interactive simulation problem is specified by two distributions $P(x,y)$
and $Q(u,v)$: The goal is to determine if two players, Alice and Bob, that
observe sequences $X^n$ and $Y^n$ respectively where $\{(X_i, Y_i)\}_{i=1}^n$
are drawn i.i.d. from $P(x,y)$ can generate pairs $U$ and $V$ respectively
(without communicating with each other) with a joint distribution that is
arbitrarily close in total variation to $Q(u,v)$. Even when $P$ and $Q$ are
extremely simple: e.g., $P$ is uniform on the triples $\{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)\}$
and $Q$ is a &quot;doubly symmetric binary source&quot;, i.e., $U$ and $V$ are uniform
$\pm 1$ variables with correlation say $0.49$, it is open if $P$ can simulate
$Q$.
  In this work, we show that whenever $P$ is a distribution on a finite domain
and $Q$ is a $2 \times 2$ distribution, then the non-interactive simulation
problem is decidable: specifically, given $\delta &gt; 0$ the algorithm runs in
time bounded by some function of $P$ and $\delta$ and either gives a
non-interactive simulation protocol that is $\delta$-close to $Q$ or asserts
that no protocol gets $O(\delta)$-close to $Q$. The main challenge to such a
result is determining explicit (computable) convergence bounds on the number
$n$ of samples that need to be drawn from $P(x,y)$ to get $\delta$-close to
$Q$. We invoke contemporary results from the analysis of Boolean functions such
as the invariance principle and a regularity lemma to obtain such explicit
bounds.

 <dc:description>  Combinatorial optimization problems are typically NP-hard, and thus very
challenging to solve. In this paper, we present the random key cuckoo search
(RKCS) algorithm for solving the famous Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). We
used a simplified random-key encoding scheme to pass from a continuous space
(real numbers) to a combinatorial space. We also consider the displacement of a
solution in both spaces using Levy flights. The performance of the proposed
RKCS is tested against a set of benchmarks of symmetric TSP from the well-known
TSPLIB library. The results of the tests show that RKCS is superior to some
other metaheuristic algorithms.

 <dc:title>Performance Comparison of Dual Connectivity and Hard Handover for LTE-5G
  Tight Integration in mmWave Cellular Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Polese, Michele</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  MmWave communications are expected to play a major role in the Fifth
generation of mobile networks. They offer a potential multi-gigabit throughput
and an ultra-low radio latency, but at the same time suffer from high isotropic
pathloss, and a coverage area much smaller than the one of LTE macrocells. In
order to address these issues, highly directional beamforming and a very
high-density deployment of mmWave base stations were proposed. This Thesis aims
to improve the reliability and performance of the 5G network by studying its
tight and seamless integration with the current LTE cellular network. In
particular, the LTE base stations can provide a coverage layer for 5G mobile
terminals, because they operate on microWave frequencies, which are less
sensitive to blockage and have a lower pathloss. This document is a copy of the
Master's Thesis carried out by Mr. Michele Polese under the supervision of Dr.
Marco Mezzavilla and Prof. Michele Zorzi. It will propose an LTE-5G tight
integration architecture, based on mobile terminals' dual connectivity to LTE
and 5G radio access networks, and will evaluate which are the new network
procedures that will be needed to support it. Moreover, this new architecture
will be implemented in the ns-3 simulator, and a thorough simulation campaign
will be conducted in order to evaluate its performance, with respect to the
baseline of handover between LTE and 5G.

 <dc:description>  Interesting data often concentrate on low dimensional smooth manifolds inside
a high dimensional ambient space. Random projections are a simple, powerful
tool for dimensionality reduction of such data. Previous works have studied
bounds on how many projections are needed to accurately preserve the geometry
of these manifolds, given their intrinsic dimensionality, volume and curvature.
However, such works employ definitions of volume and curvature that are
inherently difficult to compute. Therefore such theory cannot be easily tested
against numerical simulations to understand the tightness of the proven bounds.
We instead study typical distortions arising in random projections of an
ensemble of smooth Gaussian random manifolds. We find explicitly computable,
approximate theoretical bounds on the number of projections required to
accurately preserve the geometry of these manifolds. Our bounds, while
approximate, can only be violated with a probability that is exponentially
small in the ambient dimension, and therefore they hold with high probability
in cases of practical interest. Moreover, unlike previous work, we test our
theoretical bounds against numerical experiments on the actual geometric
distortions that typically occur for random projections of random smooth
manifolds. We find our bounds are tighter than previous results by several
orders of magnitude.

 <dc:description>  We analyze the performance of coded slotted ALOHA systems for a scenario
where users have different error protection requirements and correspondingly
can be divided into user classes. The main goal is to design the system so that
the requirements for each class are satisfied. To that end, we derive
analytical error floor approximations of the packet loss rate for each class in
the finite frame length regime, as well as the density evolution in the
asymptotic case. Based on this analysis, we propose a heuristic approach for
the optimization of the degree distributions to provide the required unequal
error protection. In addition, we analyze the decoding delay for users in
different classes and show that better protected users experience a smaller
average decoding delay.

 <dc:description>  With rapid growth in the amount of unstructured data produced by
memory-intensive applications, large scale data analytics has recently
attracted increasing interest. Processing, managing and analyzing this huge
amount of data poses several challenges in cloud and data center computing
domain. Especially, conventional frameworks for distributed data analytics are
based on the assumption of homogeneity and non-stochastic distribution of
different data-processing nodes. The paper argues the fundamental limiting
factors for scaling big data computation. It is shown that as the number of
series and parallel computing servers increase, the tail (mean and variance) of
the job execution time increase. We will first propose a model to predict the
response time of highly distributed processing tasks and then propose a new
practical computational algorithm to optimize the response time.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the feasibility of mmWave frequencies for personal
networks of wireless wearable devices in enclosed settings (e.g., commuter
trains, subways, airplanes, airports, or offices). At these frequencies,
specular reflections off surfaces are expected to contribute intended signal
power and, simultaneously, to aggravate the interference at the receivers.
Meanwhile, blockages by obstacles and people---including the individuals
wearing the devices---are expected to shield receivers from interference. With
the aid of stochastic geometry and random shape theory, we assess the interplay
of surface reflections and blockages for dense deployments of wearable networks
equipped with directional antenna arrays in relevant indoor settings.

 <dc:title>Nonlinear Stabilization via Control Contraction Metrics: a
  Pseudospectral Approach for Computing Geodesics</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Leung, Karen</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Manchester, Ian R.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Real-time nonlinear stabilization techniques are often limited by inefficient
or intractable online and/or offline computations, or a lack guarantee for
global stability. In this paper, we explore the use of Control Contraction
Metrics (CCM) for nonlinear stabilization because it offers tractable offline
computations that give formal guarantees for global stability. We provide a
method to solve the associated online computation for a CCM controller - a
pseudospectral method to find a geodesic. Through a case study of a stiff
nonlinear system, we highlight two key benefits: (i) using CCM for nonlinear
stabilization and (ii) rapid online computations amenable to real-time
implementation. We compare the performance of a CCM controller with other
popular feedback control techniques, namely the Linear Quadratic Regulator
(LQR) and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). We show that a CCM
controller using a pseudospectral approach for online computations is a middle
ground between the simplicity of LQR and stability guarantees for NMPC.

 <dc:description>  GitHub is the largest source code repository in the world. It provides a
git-based source code management platform and also many features inspired by
social networks. For example, GitHub users can show appreciation to projects by
adding stars to them. Therefore, the number of stars of a repository is a
direct measure of its popularity. In this paper, we use multiple linear
regressions to predict the number of stars of GitHub repositories. These
predictions are useful both to repository owners and clients, who usually want
to know how their projects are performing in a competitive open source
development market. In a large-scale analysis, we show that the proposed models
start to provide accurate predictions after being trained with the number of
stars received in the last six months. Furthermore, specific models---generated
using data from repositories that share the same growth trends---are
recommended for repositories with slow growth and/or for repositories with less
stars. Finally, we evaluate the ability to predict not the number of stars of a
repository but its rank among the GitHub repositories. We found a very strong
correlation between predicted and real rankings (Spearman's rho greater than
0.95).

 <dc:description>  We show that the compressed suffix array and the compressed suffix tree of a
string $T$ can be built in $O(n)$ deterministic time using $O(n\log\sigma)$
bits of space, where $n$ is the string length and $\sigma$ is the alphabet
size. Previously described deterministic algorithms either run in time that
depends on the alphabet size or need $\omega(n\log \sigma)$ bits of working
space. Our result has immediate applications to other problems, such as
yielding the first linear-time LZ77 and LZ78 parsing algorithms that use $O(n
\log\sigma)$ bits.

 <dc:description>  Despite being one of the most basic tasks in software development, debugging
is still performed in a mostly manual way, leading to high cost and low
performance. To address this problem, researchers have studied promising
approaches, such as Spectrum-based Fault Localization (SFL) techniques, which
pinpoint program elements more likely to contain faults. This survey discusses
the state-of-the-art of SFL, including the different techniques that have been
proposed, the type and number of faults they address, the types of spectra they
use, the programs they utilize in their validation, the testing data that
support them, and their use at industrial settings. Notwithstanding the
advances, there are still challenges for the industry to adopt these
techniques, which we analyze in this paper. SFL techniques should propose new
ways to generate reduced sets of suspicious entities, combine different spectra
to fine-tune the fault localization ability, use strategies to collect
fine-grained coverage levels from suspicious coarser levels for balancing
execution costs and output precision, and propose new techniques to cope with
multiple-fault programs. Moreover, additional user studies are needed to
understand better how SFL techniques can be used in practice. We conclude by
presenting a concept map about topics and challenges for future research in
SFL.

 <dc:description>  This paper shows how the application of stochastic geometry to the analysis
of wireless networks is greatly facilitated by (i) a clear separation of time
scales, (ii) the abstraction of small-scale effects via ergodicity, and (iii)
an interference model that reflects the receiver's lack of knowledge of how
each individual interference term is faded. These procedures render the
analysis both more manageable and more precise, as well as more amenable to the
incorporation of subsequent features. In particular, the paper presents
analytical characterizations of the ergodic spectral efficiency of cellular
networks with single-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and
sectorization. These characterizations, in the form of easy-to-evaluate
expressions, encompass the coverage, the distribution of spectral efficiency
over the network locations, and the average thereof.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a queueing network approach to the problem of
routing and rebalancing a fleet of self-driving vehicles providing on-demand
mobility within a capacitated road network. We refer to such systems as
autonomous mobility-on-demand systems, or AMoD. We first cast an AMoD system
into a closed, multi-class BCMP queueing network model. Second, we present
analysis tools that allow the characterization of performance metrics for a
given routing policy, in terms, e.g., of vehicle availabilities, and first and
second order moments of vehicle throughput. Third, we propose a scalable method
for the synthesis of routing policies, with performance guarantees in the limit
of large fleet sizes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results on a case
study of New York City. Collectively, this paper provides a unifying framework
for the analysis and control of AMoD systems, which subsumes earlier Jackson
and network flow models, provides a quite large set of modeling options (e.g.,
the inclusion of road capacities and general travel time distributions), and
allows the analysis of second and higher-order moments for the performance
metrics.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an analytical framework for modelling resource contention
in multi-robot systems, where the travel times and task durations are
uncertain. It uses several approximation methods to quickly and accurately
calculate the probability distributions describing the times at which the tasks
start and finish. Specific contributions include a method for calculating the
probability of a set of independent normally distributed random events
occurring in a given order, an upper bound on that probability, and a method
for calculating the most likely and $n$-th most likely orders of occurrence for
a set of independent normally distributed random events that have equal
standard deviations. The complete framework is shown to be much faster than a
Monte Carlo approach for the same accuracy in two multi-robot task allocation
problems. This is a general framework that is agnostic to the optimisation
method and objective function used, and is applicable to a wide range of
robotics and non-robotics problems.

 <dc:title>Mechanism Design for Value Maximizers</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Bidders often want to get as much as they can without violating constraints
on what they spend. For example, advertisers seek to maximize the impressions,
clicks, sales, or market share generated by their advertising, subject to
budget or return-on-investment (ROI) constraints. The quasilinear utility model
dramatically fails to capture these preferences, and so we initiate the study
of mechanism design in this different context. In single-parameter settings, we
show that any monotone allocation can be implemented truthfully. Interestingly,
even in unrestricted domains any choice function that optimizes monotone
functions of bidders' values can be implemented. For general valuations we show
that maximizing the value of the highest-value bidder is the natural analog of
welfare maximization.
  We apply our results to online advertising as a case study. Firstly, the
natural analog of welfare maximization directly generalizes the generalized
second price (GSP) auction commonly used to sell search ads. Finally, we show
that value-maximizing preferences are robust in a practical sense: even though
real advertisers' preferences are complex and varied, as long as outcomes are
&quot;sufficiently different,&quot; any advertiser with a moderate ROI constraint and
&quot;super-quasilinear&quot; preferences will be behaviorally equivalent to a value
maximizer. We empirically establish that for at least 80% of a sample of
auctions from the Yahoo Gemini Native ads platform, bidders requiring at least
a 100% ROI should behave like value maximizers.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an energy management scheme to maximize the use of solar
energy in the smart grid. In this context, a shared facility controller (SFC)
with a number of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in a smart community is
considered that has the capability to schedule the generated energy for
consumption and trade to other entities. Particularly, a mechanism is designed
for the SFC to decide on the energy surplus, if there is any, that it can use
to charge its battery and sell to the households and the grid based on the
offered prices. In this regard, a hierarchical energy management scheme is
proposed with a view to reduce the total operational cost to the SFC. The
concept of a virtual cost (VC) is introduced that aids the SFC to estimate its
future operational cost based on some available current information. The energy
management is conducted for three different cases and the optimal cost to the
SFC is determined for each case via the theory of maxima and minima. A
real-time algorithm is proposed to reach the optimal cost for all cases and
some numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the beneficial properties
of the proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  Understanding users' interactions with highly subjective content---like
artistic images---is challenging due to the complex semantics that guide our
preferences. On the one hand one has to overcome `standard' recommender systems
challenges, such as dealing with large, sparse, and long-tailed datasets. On
the other, several new challenges present themselves, such as the need to model
content in terms of its visual appearance, or even social dynamics, such as a
preference toward a particular artist that is independent of the art they
create.
  In this paper we build large-scale recommender systems to model the dynamics
of a vibrant digital art community, Behance, consisting of tens of millions of
interactions (clicks and `appreciates') of users toward digital art.
Methodologically, our main contributions are to model (a) rich content,
especially in terms of its visual appearance; (b) temporal dynamics, in terms
of how users prefer `visually consistent' content within and across sessions;
and (c) social dynamics, in terms of how users exhibit preferences both towards
certain art styles, as well as the artists themselves.

 <dc:description>  We present a long-term intrinsically motivated structure learning method for
modeling transition dynamics during controlled interactions between a robot and
semi-permanent structures in the world. In particular, we discuss how
partially-observable state is represented using distributions over a Markovian
state and build models of objects that predict how state distributions change
in response to interactions with such objects. These structures serve as the
basis for a number of possible future tasks defined as Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs). The approach is an example of a structure learning technique
applied to a multimodal affordance representation that yields a population of
forward models for use in planning. We evaluate the approach using experiments
on a bimanual mobile manipulator (uBot-6) that show the performance of model
acquisition as the number of transition actions increases.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel two-phase method for audio representation,
Discriminative and Compact Audio Representation (DCAR), and evaluates its
performance at detecting events in consumer-produced videos. In the first phase
of DCAR, each audio track is modeled using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) that
includes several components to capture the variability within that track. The
second phase takes into account both global structure and local structure. In
this phase, the components are rendered more discriminative and compact by
formulating an optimization problem on Grassmannian manifolds, which we found
represents the structure of audio effectively.
  Our experiments used the YLI-MED dataset (an open TRECVID-style video corpus
based on YFCC100M), which includes ten events. The results show that the
proposed DCAR representation consistently outperforms state-of-the-art audio
representations. DCAR's advantage over i-vector, mv-vector, and GMM
representations is significant for both easier and harder discrimination tasks.
We discuss how these performance differences across easy and hard cases follow
from how each type of model leverages (or doesn't leverage) the intrinsic
structure of the data. Furthermore, DCAR shows a particularly notable accuracy
advantage on events where humans have more difficulty classifying the videos,
i.e., events with lower mean annotator confidence.

 <dc:description>  Protein quality assessment (QA) by ranking and selecting protein models has
long been viewed as one of the major challenges for protein tertiary structure
prediction. Especially, estimating the quality of a single protein model, which
is important for selecting a few good models out of a large model pool
consisting of mostly low-quality models, is still a largely unsolved problem.
We introduce a novel single-model quality assessment method DeepQA based on
deep belief network that utilizes a number of selected features describing the
quality of a model from different perspectives, such as energy, physio-chemical
characteristics, and structural information. The deep belief network is trained
on several large datasets consisting of models from the Critical Assessment of
Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments, several publicly available
datasets, and models generated by our in-house ab initio method. Our experiment
demonstrate that deep belief network has better performance compared to Support
Vector Machines and Neural Networks on the protein model quality assessment
problem, and our method DeepQA achieves the state-of-the-art performance on
CASP11 dataset. It also outperformed two well-established methods in selecting
good outlier models from a large set of models of mostly low quality generated
by ab initio modeling methods. DeepQA is a useful tool for protein single model
quality assessment and protein structure prediction. The source code,
executable, document and training/test datasets of DeepQA for Linux is freely
available to non-commercial users at http://cactus.rnet.missouri.edu/DeepQA/.

 <dc:description>  Modern deep neural networks have a large number of parameters, making them
very hard to train. We propose DSD, a dense-sparse-dense training flow, for
regularizing deep neural networks and achieving better optimization
performance. In the first D (Dense) step, we train a dense network to learn
connection weights and importance. In the S (Sparse) step, we regularize the
network by pruning the unimportant connections with small weights and
retraining the network given the sparsity constraint. In the final D (re-Dense)
step, we increase the model capacity by removing the sparsity constraint,
re-initialize the pruned parameters from zero and retrain the whole dense
network. Experiments show that DSD training can improve the performance for a
wide range of CNNs, RNNs and LSTMs on the tasks of image classification,
caption generation and speech recognition. On ImageNet, DSD improved the Top1
accuracy of GoogLeNet by 1.1%, VGG-16 by 4.3%, ResNet-18 by 1.2% and ResNet-50
by 1.1%, respectively. On the WSJ'93 dataset, DSD improved DeepSpeech and
DeepSpeech2 WER by 2.0% and 1.1%. On the Flickr-8K dataset, DSD improved the
NeuralTalk BLEU score by over 1.7. DSD is easy to use in practice: at training
time, DSD incurs only one extra hyper-parameter: the sparsity ratio in the S
step. At testing time, DSD doesn't change the network architecture or incur any
inference overhead. The consistent and significant performance gain of DSD
experiments shows the inadequacy of the current training methods for finding
the best local optimum, while DSD effectively achieves superior optimization
performance for finding a better solution. DSD models are available to download

 <dc:description>  Physical properties of materials are seldom studied in the context of packing
problems. In this work we study the behavior of semifluids: materials with
particular characteristics, that share properties both with solids and with
fluids. We describe the importance of some specific semifluids in an industrial
context, and propose methods for tackling the problem of packing them, taking
into account several practical requirements and physical constraints. Although
the focus of this paper is on the computation of practical solutions, it also
uncovers interesting mathematical properties of this problem, which
differentiate it from other packing problems.

 <dc:description>  Robotic manipulation of deformable objects is a difficult problem especially
because of the complexity of the many different ways an object can deform.
Searching such a high dimensional state space makes it difficult to recognize,
track, and manipulate deformable objects. In this paper, we introduce a
predictive, model-driven approach to address this challenge, using a
pre-computed, simulated database of deformable object models. Mesh models of
common deformable garments are simulated with the garments picked up in
multiple different poses under gravity, and stored in a database for fast and
efficient retrieval. To validate this approach, we developed a comprehensive
pipeline for manipulating clothing as in a typical laundry task. First, the
database is used for category and pose estimation for a garment in an arbitrary
position. A fully featured 3D model of the garment is constructed in real-time
and volumetric features are then used to obtain the most similar model in the
database to predict the object category and pose. Second, the database can
significantly benefit the manipulation of deformable objects via non-rigid
registration, providing accurate correspondences between the reconstructed
object model and the database models. Third, the accurate model simulation can
also be used to optimize the trajectories for manipulation of deformable
objects, such as the folding of garments. Extensive experimental results are
shown for the tasks above using a variety of different clothing.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the evolution of line of sight (LOS) blockage over both time
and space for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channels. Using realistic vehicular
mobility and building and foliage locations from maps, we first perform LOS
blockage analysis to extract LOS probabilities in real cities and on highways
for varying vehicular densities. Next, to model the time evolution of LOS
blockage for V2V links, we employ a three-state discrete-time Markov chain
comprised of the following states: i) LOS; ii) non-LOS due to static objects
(e.g., buildings, trees, etc.); and iii) non-LOS due to mobile objects
(vehicles). We obtain state transition probabilities based on the evolution of
LOS blockage. Finally, we perform curve fitting and obtain a set of
distance-dependent equations for both LOS and transition probabilities. These
equations can be used to generate time-evolved V2V channel realizations for
representative urban and highway environments. Our results can be used to
perform highly efficient and accurate simulations without the need to employ
complex geometry-based models for link evolution.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers password generators, i.e. systems designed to generate
site-specific passwords on demand. Such systems are an alternative to password
managers. Over the last 15 years a range of password generator systems have
been described. This paper proposes the first general model for such systems,
and critically examines options for instantiating this model; options
considered include all those previously proposed as part of existing schemes as
well as certain novel possibilities. The model enables a more objective and
high-level assessment of the design of such systems; it has also been used to
sketch a possible new scheme, AutoPass, intended to incorporate the best
features of the prior art whilst also addressing many of the most serious
shortcomings of existing systems through the inclusion of novel features.

 <dc:description>  Cloze-style queries are representative problems in reading comprehension.
Over the past few months, we have seen much progress that utilizing neural
network approach to solve Cloze-style questions. In this paper, we present a
novel model called attention-over-attention reader for the Cloze-style reading
comprehension task. Our model aims to place another attention mechanism over
the document-level attention, and induces &quot;attended attention&quot; for final
predictions. Unlike the previous works, our neural network model requires less
pre-defined hyper-parameters and uses an elegant architecture for modeling.
Experimental results show that the proposed attention-over-attention model
significantly outperforms various state-of-the-art systems by a large margin in
public datasets, such as CNN and Children's Book Test datasets.

 <dc:title>A Theoretical Analysis of the BDeu Scores in Bayesian Network Structure
  Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Suzuki, Joe</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In Bayesian network structure learning (BNSL), we need the prior probability
over structures and parameters. If the former is the uniform distribution, the
latter determines the correctness of BNSL. In this paper, we compare BDeu
(Bayesian Dirichlet equivalent uniform) and Jeffreys' prior w.r.t. their
consistency. When we seek a parent set $U$ of a variable $X$, we require
regularity that if $H(X|U)\leq H(X|U')$ and $U\subsetneq U'$, then $U$ should
be chosen rather than $U'$. We prove that the BDeu scores violate the property
and cause fatal situations in BNSL. This is because for the BDeu scores, for
any sample size $n$,there exists a probability in the form
$P(X,Y,Z)={P(XZ)P(YZ)}/{P(Z)}$ such that the probability of deciding that $X$
and $Y$ are not conditionally independent given $Z$ is more than a half. For
Jeffreys' prior, the false-positive probability uniformly converges to zero
without depending on any parameter values, and no such an inconvenience occurs.

 <dc:description>  This letter offers the first characterisation of the stability for
full-duplex large size networks. Through stochastic geometry tools, key
performance metrics like delay and maximum stable arrival rate are derived for
the non saturated system and compared to a half-duplex counterpart, also
accounting for imperfect self-interference cancellation. This analysis better
identifies that the full-duplex advantage is prominent for sparse networks,
whereas in dense topologies residual self-interference may hinder achievable
gains.

 <dc:description>  Canonical orderings and their relatives such as st-numberings have been used
as a key tool in algorithmic graph theory for the last decades. Recently, a
unifying concept behind all these orders has been shown: they can be described
by a graph decomposition into parts that have a prescribed vertex-connectivity.
  Despite extensive interest in canonical orderings, no analogue of this
unifying concept is known for edge-connectivity. In this paper, we establish
such a concept named edge-orders and show how to compute (1,1)-edge-orders of
2-edge-connected graphs as well as (2,1)-edge-orders of 3-edge-connected graphs
in linear time, respectively. While the former can be seen as the edge-variants
of st-numberings, the latter are the edge-variants of Mondshein sequences and
non-separating ear decompositions. The methods that we use for obtaining such
edge-orders differ considerably in almost all details from the ones used for
their vertex-counterparts, as different graph-theoretic constructions are used
in the inductive proof and standard reductions from edge- to
vertex-connectivity are bound to fail.
  As a first application, we consider the famous Edge-Independent Spanning Tree
Conjecture, which asserts that every k-edge-connected graph contains k rooted
spanning trees that are pairwise edge-independent. We illustrate the impact of
the above edge-orders by deducing algorithms that construct 2- and 3-edge
independent spanning trees of 2- and 3-edge-connected graphs, the latter of
which improves the best known running time from O(n^2) to linear time.

 <dc:description>  We present a neural network model approach for multi-frame blind

techniques for image deblurring into a single neural network architecture. Our
proposed hybrid-architecture combines the explicit prediction of a
deconvolution filter and non-trivial averaging of Fourier coefficients in the
frequency domain. In order to make full use of the information contained in all
images in one burst, the proposed network embeds smaller networks, which
explicitly allow the model to transfer information between images in early
layers. Our system is trained end-to-end using standard backpropagation on a
set of artificially generated training examples, enabling competitive
performance in multi-frame blind deconvolution, both with respect to quality
and runtime.

 <dc:description>  A real-time Deep Learning based method for Pedestrian Detection (PD) is
applied to the Human-Aware robot navigation problem. The pedestrian detector
combines the Aggregate Channel Features (ACF) detector with a deep
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to obtain fast and accurate
performance. Our solution is firstly evaluated using a set of real images taken
from onboard and offboard cameras and, then, it is validated in a typical robot
navigation environment with pedestrians (two distinct experiments are
conducted). The results on both tests show that our pedestrian detector is
robust and fast enough to be used on robot navigation applications.

 <dc:description>  Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained popularity due to
their many potential application fields. Alongside sophisticated sensors, UAVs
can be equipped with communication adaptors aimed for inter-UAV communication.
Inter-communication of UAVs to form a UAV swarm raises questions on how to
manage its communication structure and mobility. In this paper, we consider
therefore the problem of establishing an efficient swarm movement model and a
network topology between a collection of UAVs, which are specifically deployed
for the scenario of high-quality forest-mapping.
  The forest environment with its highly heterogeneous distribution of trees
and obstacles represents an extreme challenge for a UAV swarm. It requires the
swarm to constantly avoid possible collisions with trees, to change
autonomously the trajectory, which can lead to disconnection to the swarm, and
to reconnect to the swarm after passing the obstacle, while continue collecting
environmental data that needs to be fused and assessed efficiently.
  In this paper, we propose a novel solution to the formation flight problem
for UAV swarms. The proposed method provides an adaptive and reliable network
structure, which maintains swarm connectivity and communicability. These
characteristics are needed to achieve a detailed and accurate description of
the environment from the data acquired by the UAV swarm.
  The main characteristics of our approach are high scalability regarding the
number of UAVs in the swarm and the adaptive network topology within the swarm.

(ACF) detector with a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve fast
and accurate Pedestrian Detection (PD). Regarding the human awareness (that can
be defined as constraints associated with the robot's motion), we use a mixture
of asymmetric Gaussian functions, to define the cost functions associated to
each constraint. Both methods proposed herein are evaluated individually to
measure the impact of each of the components. The final solution (including
both the proposed pedestrian detection and the human-aware constraints) is
tested in a typical domestic indoor scenario, in four distinct experiments. The
results show that the robot is able to cope with human-aware constraints,
defined after common proxemics and social rules.

 <dc:description>  Various grammar compression algorithms have been proposed in the last decade.
A grammar compression is a restricted CFG deriving the string
deterministically. An efficient grammar compression develops a smaller CFG by
finding duplicated patterns and removing them. This process is just a frequent
pattern discovery by grammatical inference. While we can get any frequent
pattern in linear time using a preprocessed string, a huge working space is
required for longer patterns, and the whole string must be loaded into the
memory preliminarily. We propose an online algorithm approximating this problem
within a compressed space. The main contribution is an improvement of the
previously best known approximation ratio $\Omega(\frac{1}{\lg^2m})$ to
$\Omega(\frac{1}{\lg^*N\lg m})$ where $m$ is the length of an optimal pattern
in a string of length $N$ and $\lg^*$ is the iteration of the logarithm base
$2$. For a sufficiently large $N$, $\lg^*N$ is practically constant. The
experimental results show that our algorithm extracts nearly optimal patterns
and achieves a significant improvement in memory consumption compared to the
offline algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We consider a multichannel Cognitive Radio Network (CRN), where secondary
users sequentially sense channels for opportunistic spectrum access. In this
scenario, the Channel Selection Algorithm (CSA) allows secondary users to find
a vacant channel with the minimal number of channel switches. Most of the
existing CSA literature assumes exponential ON-OFF time distribution for
primary users (PU) channel occupancy pattern. This exponential assumption might
be helpful to get performance bounds; but not useful to evaluate the
performance of CSA under realistic conditions. An in-depth analysis of
independent spectrum measurement traces reveals that wireless channels have
typically heavy-tailed PU OFF times. In this paper, we propose an extension to
the Predictive CSA framework and its generalization for heavy tailed PU OFF
time distribution, which represents realistic scenarios. In particular, we
calculate the probability of channel being idle for hyper-exponential OFF times
to use in CSA. We implement our proposed CSA framework in a wireless test-bed
and comprehensively evaluate its performance by recreating the realistic PU
channel occupancy patterns. The proposed CSA shows significant reduction in
channel switches and energy consumption as compared to Predictive CSA which
always assumes exponential PU ON-OFF times.Through our work, we show the impact
of the PU channel occupancy pattern on the performance of CSA in multichannel
CRN.

 <dc:description>  Emerging trends in smartphones, online maps, social media, and the resulting
geo-located data, provide opportunities to collect traces of people's
socio-economical activities in a much more granular and direct fashion,
triggering a revolution in empirical research. These vast mobile data offer new
perspectives and approaches for measurements of economic dynamics and are
broadening the research fields of social science and economics. In this paper,
we explore the potential of using mobile big data for measuring economic
activities of China. Firstly, We build indices for gauging employment and
consumer trends based on billions of geo-positioning data. Secondly, we advance
the estimation of store offline foot traffic via location search data derived
from Baidu Maps, which is then applied to predict revenues of Apple in China
and detect box-office fraud accurately. Thirdly, we construct consumption
indicators to track the trends of various industries in service sector, which
are verified by several existing indicators. To the best of our knowledge, we
are the first to measure the second largest economy by mining such
unprecedentedly large scale and fine granular spatial-temporal data. Our
research provides new approaches and insights on measuring economic activities.

 <dc:description>  Software engineering is extremely information-intensive. Every day developers
work with source code, version repositories, issue trackers, documentation,
web-based and other information resources. However, three key aspects of
information work lack good support: (i) combining information from different
sources; (ii) flexibly presenting collected information to enable easier
comprehension; and (iii) automatically acting on collected information, for
example to perform a refactoring. Poor support for these activities makes many
common development tasks time-consuming and error-prone. We propose an approach
that directly addresses these three issues by integrating a flexible query
mechanism into the development environment. Our approach enables diverse ways
to process and visualize information and can be extended via scripts. We
demonstrate how an implementation of the approach can be used to rapidly write
queries that meet a wide range of information needs.

 <dc:description>  The use of temporal logics has long been recognised as a fundamental approach
to the formal specification and verification of reactive systems. In this
paper, we take on the problem of automatically verifying a temporal property,
given by a CTL formula, for a given (possibly infinite-state) program. We
propose a method based on encoding the problem as a set of Horn constraints.
The method takes a program, modeled as a transition system, and a property
given by a CTL formula as input. It first generates a set of forall-exists
quantified Horn constraints and well-foundedness constraints by exploiting the
syntactic structure of the CTL formula. Then, the generated set of constraints
are solved by applying an off-the-shelf Horn constraints solving engine. The
program is said to satisfy the property if and only if the generated set of
constraints has a solution. We demonstrate the practical promises of the method
by applying it on a set of challenging examples. Although our method is based
on a generic Horn constraint solving engine, it is able to outperform
state-of-art methods specialised for CTL verification.

 <dc:description>  In model based development, embedded systems are modeled using a mix of
dataflow formalism, that capture the flow of computation, and hierarchical
state machines, that capture the modal behavior of the system. For safety
analysis, existing approaches rely on a compilation scheme that transform the
original model (dataflow and state machines) into a pure dataflow formalism.
Such compilation often result in loss of important structural information that
capture the modal behaviour of the system. In previous work we have developed a
compilation technique from a dataflow formalism into modular Horn clauses. In
this paper, we present a novel technique that faithfully compile hierarchical
state machines into modular Horn clauses. Our compilation technique preserves
the structural and modal behavior of the system, making the safety analysis of
such models more tractable.

 <dc:title>Challenges in Decomposing Encodings of Verification Problems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Schrammel, Peter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Modern program verifiers use logic-based encodings of the verification
problem that are discharged by a back end reasoning engine. However, instances
of such encodings for large programs can quickly overwhelm these back end
solvers. Hence, we need techniques to make the solving process scale to large
systems, such as partitioning (divide-and-conquer) and abstraction.
  In recent work, we showed how decomposing the formula encoding of a
termination analysis can significantly increase efficiency. The analysis
generates a sequence of logical formulas with existentially quantified
predicates that are solved by a synthesis-based program analysis engine.
However, decomposition introduces abstractions in addition to those required
for finding the unknown predicates in the formula, and can hence deteriorate
precision. We discuss the challenges associated with such decompositions and
their interdependencies with the solving process.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we show that checking satisfiability of a set of non-linear
Horn clauses (also called a non-linear Horn clause program) can be achieved
using a solver for linear Horn clauses. We achieve this by interleaving a
program transformation with a satisfiability checker for linear Horn clauses
(also called a solver for linear Horn clauses). The program transformation is
based on the notion of tree dimension, which we apply to a set of non-linear
clauses, yielding a set whose derivation trees have bounded dimension. Such a
set of clauses can be linearised. The main algorithm then proceeds by applying
the linearisation transformation and solver for linear Horn clauses to a
sequence of sets of clauses with successively increasing dimension bound. The
approach is then further developed by using a solution of clauses of lower
dimension to (partially) linearise clauses of higher dimension. We constructed
a prototype implementation of this approach and performed some experiments on a
set of verification problems, which shows some promise.

 <dc:description>  Verification conditions (VCs) are logical formulas whose satisfiability
guarantees program correctness. We consider VCs in the form of constrained Horn
clauses (CHC) which are automatically generated from the encoding of (an
interpreter of) the operational semantics of the programming language. VCs are
derived through program specialization based on the unfold/fold transformation
rules and, as it often happens when specializing interpreters, they contain
unnecessary variables, that is, variables which are not required for the
correctness proofs of the programs under verification. In this paper we adapt
to the CHC setting some of the techniques that were developed for removing
unnecessary variables from logic programs, and we show that, in some cases, the
application of these techniques increases the effectiveness of Horn clause
solvers when proving program correctness.

 <dc:description>  A bit layout is a sequence of fields of certain bit lengths that specifies
how to interpret a serial stream, e.g., the MP3 audio format. A layout with
variable length fields needs to include meta-information to help the parser
interpret unambiguously the rest of the stream; e.g. a field providing the
length of a following variable length field. If no such information is
available, then the layout is ambiguous. I present a linear-time algorithm to
determine whether a layout is ambiguous or not by modelling the behaviour of a
serial parser reading the stream as forward chaining reasoning on a collection
of Horn clauses.

 <dc:description>  Let $\Sigma_d^{++}$ be the set of positive definite matrices with determinant
1 in dimension $d\ge 2$. Identifying any two $SL_d(\mathbb{Z})$-congruent
elements in $\Sigma_d^{++}$ gives rise to the space of reduced quadratic forms
of determinant one, which in turn can be identified with the locally symmetric
space $X_d:=SL_d(\mathbb{Z})\backslash SL_d(\mathbb{R})/SO_d(\mathbb{R})$.
Equip the latter space with its natural probability measure coming from a Haar
measure on $SL_d(\mathbb{R})$. In 1998, Kleinbock and Margulis established
sharp estimates for the probability that an element of $X_d$ takes a value less
than a given real number $\delta&gt;0$ over the non--zero lattice points
$\mathbb{Z}^d\backslash\{ 0 \}$.
  In this article, these estimates are extended to a large class of probability
measures arising either from the spectral or the Cholesky decomposition of an
element of $\Sigma_d^{++}$. The sharpness of the bounds thus obtained are also
established (up to multiplicative constants) for a subclass of these measures.
  Although of an independent interest, this theory is partly developed here
with a view towards application to Information Theory. More precisely, after
providing a concise introduction to this topic fitted to our needs, we lay the
theoretical foundations of the study of some manifolds frequently appearing in
the theory of Signal Processing. This is then applied to the recently
introduced Integer-Forcing Receiver Architecture channel whose importance stems
from its expected high performance. Here, we give sharp estimates for the
probabilistic distribution of the so-called \emph{Effective Signal--to--Noise
Ratio}, which is an essential quantity in the evaluation of the performance of
this model.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) process input text sequentially and model
the conditional transition between word tokens. In contrast, the advantages of
recursive networks include that they explicitly model the compositionality and
the recursive structure of natural language. However, the current recursive
architecture is limited by its dependence on syntactic tree. In this paper, we
introduce a robust syntactic parsing-independent tree structured model, Neural
Tree Indexers (NTI) that provides a middle ground between the sequential RNNs
and the syntactic treebased recursive models. NTI constructs a full n-ary tree
by processing the input text with its node function in a bottom-up fashion.
Attention mechanism can then be applied to both structure and node function. We
implemented and evaluated a binarytree model of NTI, showing the model achieved
the state-of-the-art performance on three different NLP tasks: natural language
inference, answer sentence selection, and sentence classification,
outperforming state-of-the-art recurrent and recursive neural networks.

 <dc:title>Selecting Algorithms for Black Box Matrices: Checking for Matrix
  Properties That Can Simplify Computations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Eberly, Wayne</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Processes to automate the selection of appropriate algorithms for various
matrix computations are described. In particular, processes to check for, and
certify, various matrix properties of black box matrices are presented. These
include sparsity patterns and structural properties that allow &quot;superfast&quot;
algorithms to be used in place of black-box algorithms. Matrix properties that
hold generically, and allow the use of matrix preconditioning to be reduced or
eliminated, can also be checked for and certified - notably including in the
small-field case, where this presently has the greatest impact on the
efficiency of the computation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we examine a number of term rewriting system for integer number
representations, building further upon the datatype defining systems described
in [2]. In particular, we look at automated methods for proving confluence and
termination in binary and decimal term rewriting systems for both append and
tree constructor functions. We find that some of these term rewriting systems
are not strongly terminating, which we resolve with minor changes to these
systems. Moreover, most of the term rewriting systems discussed do not exhibit
the confluence property, which seems more difficult to resolve.

 <dc:description>  Maintaining the stability of synchronization state is crucial for the
functioning of many natural and artificial systems. In this study, we develop
methods to optimize the synchronization stability of the Kuramoto model by
minimizing the dominant Lyapunov exponent. With the help of the recently
proposed cut-set space approximation of the steady states, we greatly simplify
the objective function, and further derive its gradient and Hessian with
respect to natural frequencies, which leads to an efficient algorithm with the
quasi-Newton's method. The optimized systems are demonstrated to achieve better
synchronization stability for the Kuramoto model with or without inertia in
certain regimes. Hence our method is applicable in improving the stability of
power grids. It is also viable to adjust the coupling strength of each link to
improve the stability of the system. Various operational constraints can also
be easily integrated into our scope by employing the interior point method in
convex optimization. The properties of the optimized networks are also
discussed.

 <dc:title>Black Box Linear Algebra: Extending Wiedemann's Analysis of a Sparse
  Matrix Preconditioner for Computations over Small Fields</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Eberly, Wayne</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Wiedemann's paper, introducing his algorithm for sparse and structured matrix
computations over arbitrary fields, also presented a pair of matrix
preconditioners for computations over small fields. The analysis of the second
of these is extended in order to provide more explicit statements of the
expected number of nonzero entries in the matrices obtained as well as bounds
on the probability that such matrices have maximal rank.
  This is part of ongoing work to establish that this matrix preconditioner can
also be used to bound the number of nontrivial nilpotent blocks in the Jordan
normal form of a preconditioned matrix, in such a way that one can also sample
uniformly from the null space of the originally given matrix. If successful
this will result in a black box algorithm for the type of matrix computation
required when using the number field sieve for integer factorization that is
provably reliable and - by a small factor - asymptotically more efficient than
alternative techniques that make use of other matrix preconditioners or require
computations over field extensions.

 <dc:description>  Conventional structure-from-motion (SFM) research is primarily concerned with
the 3D reconstruction of a single, rigidly moving object seen by a static
camera, or a static and rigid scene observed by a moving camera --in both cases
there are only one relative rigid motion involved. Recent progress have
extended SFM to the areas of {multi-body SFM} (where there are {multiple rigid}
relative motions in the scene), as well as {non-rigid SFM} (where there is a
single non-rigid, deformable object or scene). Along this line of thinking,
there is apparently a missing gap of &quot;multi-body non-rigid SFM&quot;, in which the
task would be to jointly reconstruct and segment multiple 3D structures of the
multiple, non-rigid objects or deformable scenes from images. Such a multi-body
non-rigid scenario is common in reality (e.g. two persons shaking hands,
multi-person social event), and how to solve it represents a natural
{next-step} in SFM research. By leveraging recent results of subspace
clustering, this paper proposes, for the first time, an effective framework for
multi-body NRSFM, which simultaneously reconstructs and segments each 3D
trajectory into their respective low-dimensional subspace. Under our
formulation, 3D trajectories for each non-rigid structure can be well
approximated with a sparse affine combination of other 3D trajectories from the
same structure (self-expressiveness). We solve the resultant optimization with
the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed framework through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real data sequences. Our method clearly outperforms other
alternative methods, such as first clustering the 2D feature tracks to groups
and then doing non-rigid reconstruction in each group or first conducting 3D
reconstruction by using single subspace assumption and then clustering the 3D
trajectories into groups.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a class of Gaussian layered networks where a source communicates
with a destination through $L$ intermediate relay layers with $N$ nodes in each
layer in the presence of a single eavesdropper which can overhear the
transmissions of the nodes in any one layer. The problem of maximum secrecy
rate achievable with analog network coding for a unicast communication over
such layered wireless relay networks with directed links is considered. A relay
node performing analog network coding scales and forwards the signals received
at its input. The key contribution of this work is a lemma that provides the
globally optimal set of scaling factors for the nodes that maximizes the
end-to-end secrecy rate for a class of layered networks. We also show that in
the high-SNR regime, ANC achieves secrecy rates within a constant gap of the
cutset upper bound on the secrecy capacity. To the best of our knowledge, this
work offers the first characterization of the performance of secure ANC in
multi-layered networks in the presence of an eavesdropper.

 <dc:title>Maximizing a Monotone Submodular Function with a Bounded Curvature under

 <dc:creator>Yoshida, Yuichi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a
knapsack constraint. We show that, for any fixed $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there exists a
polynomial-time algorithm with an approximation ratio $1-c/e-\epsilon$, where
$c \in [0,1]$ is the (total) curvature of the input function. This
approximation ratio is tight up to $\epsilon$ for any $c \in [0,1]$. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first result for a knapsack constraint that
incorporates the curvature to obtain an approximation ratio better than
$1-1/e$, which is tight for general submodular functions. As an application of
our result, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for the budget allocation
problem with an improved approximation ratio.

 <dc:description>  In this work we present a trajectory Optimization framework for whole-body
motion planning through contacts. We demonstrate how the proposed approach can
be applied to automatically discover different gaits and dynamic motions on a
quadruped robot. In contrast to most previous methods, we do not pre-specify
contact switches, timings, points or gait patterns, but they are a direct
outcome of the optimization. Furthermore, we optimize over the entire dynamics
of the robot, which enables the optimizer to fully leverage the capabilities of
the robot. To illustrate the spectrum of achievable motions, here we show eight
different tasks, which would require very different control structures when
solved with state-of-the-art methods. Using our trajectory Optimization
approach, we are solving each task with a simple, high level cost function and
without any changes in the control structure. Furthermore, we fully integrated
our approach with the robot's control and estimation framework such that
optimization can be run online. By demonstrating a rough manipulation task with
multiple dynamic contact switches, we exemplarily show how optimized
trajectories and control inputs can be directly applied to hardware.

 <dc:title>On Distance-$d$ Independent Set and other problems in graphs with few

 <dc:description>  Fomin and Villanger (STACS 2010) proved that Maximum Independent Set,
Feedback Vertex Set, and more generally the problem of finding a maximum
induced subgraph of treewith at most a constant $t$, can be solved in
polynomial time on graph classes with polynomially many minimal separators. We
extend these results in two directions. Let $\Gpoly$ be the class of graphs
with at most $\poly(n)$ minimal separators, for some polynomial $\poly$.
  We show that the odd powers of a graph $G$ have at most as many minimal
separators as $G$. Consequently, \textsc{Distance-$d$ Independent Set}, which
consists in finding maximum set of vertices at pairwise distance at least $d$,
is polynomial on $\Gpoly$, for any even $d$. The problem is NP-hard on chordal
graphs for any odd $d \geq 3$.
  We also provide polynomial algorithms for Connected Vertex Cover and
Connected Feedback Vertex Set on subclasses of $\Gpoly$ including chordal and
circular-arc graphs, and we discuss variants of independent domination
problems.

 <dc:description>  To find the cause of a functional or non-functional defect (bug) in software
running on a multi-processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC), developers need insight
into the chip. Tracing systems provide this insight non-intrusively, at the
cost of high off-chip bandwidth requirements. This I/O bottleneck limits the
observability, a problem becoming more severe as more functionality is
integrated on-chip. In this paper, we present DiaSys, an MPSoC diagnosis system
with the potential to replace today's tracing systems. Its main idea is to
partially execute the analysis of observation data on the chip; in consequence,
more information and less data is sent to the attached host PC. With DiaSys,
the data analysis is performed by the diagnosis application. Its input are
events, which are generated by observation hardware at interesting points in
the program execution (like a function call). Its outputs are events with
higher information density. The event transformation is modeled as dataflow
application. For execution, it is mapped in part to dedicated and distributed
on-chip components, and in part to the host PC; the off-chip boundary is
transparent to the developer of the diagnosis application. We implement DiaSys
as extension to an existing SoC with four tiles and a mesh network running on
an FPGA platform. Two usage examples confirm that DiaSys is flexible enough to
replace a tracing system, while significantly lowering the off-chip bandwidth
requirements. In our examples, the debugging of a race-condition bug, and the
creation of a lock contention profile, we see a reduction of trace bandwidth of
more than three orders of magnitude, compared to a full trace created by a
common tracing system.

 <dc:description>  We provide simple and fast polynomial time approximation schemes (PTASs) for
several variants of the max-sum diversification problem which, in its most
basic form, is as follows: Given n points p_1,...,p_n in R^d and an integer k,
select k points such that the average Euclidean distance between these points
is maximized. This problem commonly appears in information retrieval and
web-search in order to select a diverse set of points from the input. In this
context, it has recently received a lot of attention.
  We present new techniques to analyze natural local search algorithms. This
leads to a (1-O(1/k))-approximation for distances of negative type, even
subject to any matroid constraint of rank k, in time O(n k^2 log k), when
assuming that distance evaluations and calls to the independence oracle are
constant time. Negative type distances include as special cases Euclidean
distances and many further natural distances. Our result easily transforms into
a PTAS and improves on the only previously known PTAS for this setting, which
relies on convex optimization techniques in an n-dimensional space and is
impractical for large data sets. In contrast, our procedure has an (optimal)
linear dependence on n.
  Using generalized exchange properties of matroid intersection, we show that a
PTAS can be obtained for matroid intersection constraints as well. Moreover,
our techniques, being based on local search, are conceptually simple and allow
for various extensions. In particular, we get asymptotically optimal
O(1)-approximations when combining the classic dispersion function with a
monotone submodular objective, which is a very common class of functions to
measure diversity and relevance. This result leverages recent advances on local
search techniques based on proxy functions to obtain optimal approximations for
monotone submodular function maximization subject to a matroid constraint.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO with large antenna array has attracted
considerable interests from academic and industry communities, as it can
provide larger bandwidth and higher spectrum efficiency. However, with hundreds
of antennas, the number of radio frequency (RF) chains required by mmWave MIMO
is also huge, leading to unaffordable hardware cost and power consumption in
practice. In this paper, we investigate low RF-complexity technologies to solve
this bottleneck. We first review the evolution of low RF-complexity
technologies from microwave frequencies to mmWave frequencies. Then, we discuss
two promising low RF-complexity technologies for mmWave MIMO systems in detail,
i.e., phased array based hybrid precoding (PAHP) and lens array based hybrid
precoding (LAHP), including their principles, advantages, challenges, and
recent results. We compare the performance of these two technologies to draw
some insights about how they can be deployed in practice. Finally, we conclude
this paper and point out some future research directions in this area.

 <dc:description>  Vehicle detection and annotation for streaming video data with complex scenes
is an interesting but challenging task for urban traffic surveillance. In this
paper, we present a fast framework of Detection and Annotation for Vehicles
(DAVE), which effectively combines vehicle detection and attributes annotation.
DAVE consists of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs): a fast vehicle
proposal network (FVPN) for vehicle-like objects extraction and an attributes
learning network (ALN) aiming to verify each proposal and infer each vehicle's
pose, color and type simultaneously. These two nets are jointly optimized so
that abundant latent knowledge learned from the ALN can be exploited to guide
FVPN training. Once the system is trained, it can achieve efficient vehicle
detection and annotation for real-world traffic surveillance data. We evaluate
DAVE on a new self-collected UTS dataset and the public PASCAL VOC2007 car and
LISA 2010 datasets, with consistent improvements over existing algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Research on Offline Handwritten Signature Verification explored a large
variety of handcrafted feature extractors, ranging from graphology, texture
descriptors to interest points. In spite of advancements in the last decades,
performance of such systems is still far from optimal when we test the systems
against skilled forgeries - signature forgeries that target a particular
individual. In previous research, we proposed a formulation of the problem to
learn features from data (signature images) in a Writer-Independent format,
using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), seeking to improve performance
on the task. In this research, we push further the performance of such method,
exploring a range of architectures, and obtaining a large improvement in
state-of-the-art performance on the GPDS dataset, the largest publicly
available dataset on the task. In the GPDS-160 dataset, we obtained an Equal
Error Rate of 2.74%, compared to 6.97% in the best result published in
literature (that used a combination of multiple classifiers). We also present a
visual analysis of the feature space learned by the model, and an analysis of
the errors made by the classifier. Our analysis shows that the model is very
effective in separating signatures that have a different global appearance,
while being particularly vulnerable to forgeries that very closely resemble
genuine signatures, even if their line quality is bad, which is the case of
slowly-traced forgeries.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have shown recent promise in many language-related tasks
such as the modeling of conversations. We extend RNN-based sequence to sequence
models to capture the long range discourse across many turns of conversation.
We perform a sensitivity analysis on how much additional context affects
performance, and provide quantitative and qualitative evidence that these
models are able to capture discourse relationships across multiple utterances.
Our results quantifies how adding an additional RNN layer for modeling
discourse improves the quality of output utterances and providing more of the
previous conversation as input also improves performance. By searching the
generated outputs for specific discourse markers we show how neural discourse
models can exhibit increased coherence and cohesion in conversations.

 <dc:description>  Many machine learning tasks, such as learning with invariance and policy
evaluation in reinforcement learning, can be characterized as problems of
learning from conditional distributions. In such problems, each sample $x$
itself is associated with a conditional distribution $p(z|x)$ represented by
samples $\{z_i\}_{i=1}^M$, and the goal is to learn a function $f$ that links
these conditional distributions to target values $y$. These learning problems
become very challenging when we only have limited samples or in the extreme
case only one sample from each conditional distribution. Commonly used
approaches either assume that $z$ is independent of $x$, or require an
overwhelmingly large samples from each conditional distribution.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach which employs a new
min-max reformulation of the learning from conditional distribution problem.
With such new reformulation, we only need to deal with the joint distribution
$p(z,x)$. We also design an efficient learning algorithm, Embedding-SGD, and
establish theoretical sample complexity for such problems. Finally, our
numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that the
proposed approach can significantly improve over the existing algorithms.

 <dc:title>A Counterexample to the Forward Recursion in Fuzzy Critical Path
  Analysis Under Discrete Fuzzy Sets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liberatore, Matthew J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>62A86</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Fuzzy logic is an alternate approach for quantifying uncertainty relating to
activity duration. The fuzzy version of the backward recursion has been shown
to produce results that incorrectly amplify the level of uncertainty. However,
the fuzzy version of the forward recursion has been widely proposed as an
approach for determining the fuzzy set of critical path lengths. In this paper,
the direct application of the extension principle leads to a proposition that
must be satisfied in fuzzy critical path analysis. Using a counterexample it is
demonstrated that the fuzzy forward recursion when discrete fuzzy sets are used
to represent activity durations produces results that are not consistent with
the theory presented. The problem is shown to be the application of the fuzzy
maximum. Several methods presented in the literature are described and shown to
provide results that are consistent with the extension principle.

 <dc:description>  In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), sound sensing applications
are required to run on embedded platforms where notions of product pricing and
form factor impose hard constraints on the available computing power. Whereas
Automatic Environmental Sound Recognition (AESR) algorithms are most often
developed with limited consideration for computational cost, this article seeks
which AESR algorithm can make the most of a limited amount of computing power
by comparing the sound classification performance em as a function of its
computational cost. Results suggest that Deep Neural Networks yield the best
ratio of sound classification accuracy across a range of computational costs,
while Gaussian Mixture Models offer a reasonable accuracy at a consistently
small cost, and Support Vector Machines stand between both in terms of
compromise between accuracy and computational cost.

 <dc:title>Spatial Context based Angular Information Preserving Projection for

 <dc:creator>Cui, Minshan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Prasad, Saurabh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Dimensionality reduction is a crucial preprocessing for hyperspectral data
analysis - finding an appropriate subspace is often required for subsequent
image classification. In recent work, we proposed supervised angular
information based dimensionality reduction methods to find effective subspaces.
Since unlabeled data are often more readily available compared to labeled data,
we propose an unsupervised projection that finds a lower dimensional subspace
where local angular information is preserved. To exploit spatial information
from the hyperspectral images, we further extend our unsupervised projection to
incorporate spatial contextual information around each pixel in the image.
Additionally, we also propose a sparse representation based classifier which is
optimized to exploit spatial information during classification - we hence
assert that our proposed projection is particularly suitable for classifiers
where local similarity and spatial context are both important. Experimental
results with two real-world hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our
proposed methods provide a robust classification performance.

 <dc:description>  The stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (s-LLGS) equation is
widely used to study the temporal evolution of the macrospin subject to spin
torque and thermal noise. The numerical simulation of the s-LLGS equation
requires an appropriate choice of stochastic calculus and numerical integration
scheme. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate the accuracy and complexity
of various numerical techniques to solve the s-LLGS equation. We focus on
implicit midpoint, Heun, and Euler-Heun methods that converge to the
Stratonovich solution of the s-LLGS equation. By performing numerical tests for
both strong (path-wise) and weak (statistical) convergence, we quantify the
accuracy of various numerical schemes used to solve the s-LLGS equation. We
demonstrate a new method intended to solve Stochastic Differential Equations
(SDEs) with small noise (RK4-Heun), and test its capability to handle the
s-LLGS equation. We also discuss the circuit implementation of nanomagnets for
large-scale SPICE-based simulations. We evaluate the efficacy of SPICE in
handling the stochastic dynamics of the multiplicative noise in the s-LLGS
equation. Numerical schemes such as Euler and Gear, typically used by
SPICE-based circuit simulators do not yield the expected outcome when solving
the Stratonovich s-LLGS equation. While the trapezoidal method in SPICE does
solve for the Stratonovich solution, its accuracy is limited by the minimum
time step of integration in SPICE. We implement the s-LLGS equation in both its
cartesian and spherical coordinates form in SPICE and compare the stability and
accuracy of the two implementations. The results in this paper will serve as
guidelines for researchers to understand the tradeoffs between accuracy and
complexity of various numerical methods and the choice of appropriate calculus
to solve the s-LLGS equation.

 <dc:description>  We study variants of Mastermind, a popular board game in which the objective
is sequence reconstruction. In this two-player game, the so-called
\textit{codemaker} constructs a hidden sequence $H = (h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n)$
of colors selected from an alphabet $\mathcal{A} = \{1,2,\ldots, k\}$
(\textit{i.e.,} $h_i\in\mathcal{A}$ for all $i\in\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$). The game
then proceeds in turns, each of which consists of two parts: in turn $t$, the
second player (the \textit{codebreaker}) first submits a query sequence $Q_t =
(q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n)$ with $q_i\in \mathcal{A}$ for all $i$, and second
receives feedback $\Delta(Q_t, H)$, where $\Delta$ is some agreed-upon function
of distance between two sequences with $n$ components. The game terminates when
$Q_t = H$, and the codebreaker seeks to end the game in as few turns as
possible. Throughout we let $f(n,k)$ denote the smallest integer such that the
codebreaker can determine any $H$ in $f(n,k)$ turns. We prove three main
results: First, when $H$ is known to be a permutation of $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$,
we prove that $f(n, n)\ge n - \log\log n$ for all sufficiently large $n$.
Second, we show that Knuth's Minimax algorithm identifies any $H$ in at most
$nk$ queries. Third, when feedback is not received until all queries have been
submitted, we show that $f(n,k)=\Omega(n\log k)$.

 <dc:description>  Continuous word representations, trained on large unlabeled corpora are
useful for many natural language processing tasks. Popular models that learn
such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct
vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large
vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach
based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of
character $n$-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character
$n$-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our
method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us
to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training
data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on
word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed
morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve
state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.

 <dc:description>  Person re-identification in a multi-camera environment is an important part
of modern surveillance systems. Person re-identification from color images has
been the focus of much active research, due to the numerous challenges posed
with such analysis tasks, such as variations in illumination, pose and
viewpoints. In this paper, we suggest that hyperspectral imagery has the
potential to provide unique information that is expected to be beneficial for
the re-identification task. Specifically, we assert that by accurately
characterizing the unique spectral signature for each person's skin,
hyperspectral imagery can provide very useful descriptors (e.g. spectral
signatures from skin pixels) for re-identification. Towards this end, we
acquired proof-of-concept hyperspectral re-identification data under
challenging (practical) conditions from 15 people. Our results indicate that
hyperspectral data result in a substantially enhanced re-identification
performance compared to color (RGB) images, when using spectral signatures over
skin as the feature descriptor.

 <dc:title>The recursion hierarchy for PCF is strict</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Longley, John</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let $PCF_k$ denote the sublanguage of Plotkin's PCF in which fixed point
operators $Y_\sigma$ are admitted only for types $\sigma$ of level $\leq k$. We
show that the languages $PCF_k$ form a strict hierarchy, in the sense that none
of the $Y_\sigma$ for $\sigma$ of level $k+1$ are definable in $PCF_k$ up to
observational equivalence. This answers a question posed by Berger in 1999. Our
proof makes substantial use of the theory of nested sequential procedures (also
called PCF B\&quot;ohm trees) as expounded in the recent book of Longley and
Normann.

 <dc:title>Guided Policy Search as Approximate Mirror Descent</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Guided policy search algorithms can be used to optimize complex nonlinear
policies, such as deep neural networks, without directly computing policy
gradients in the high-dimensional parameter space. Instead, these methods use
supervised learning to train the policy to mimic a &quot;teacher&quot; algorithm, such as
a trajectory optimizer or a trajectory-centric reinforcement learning method.
Guided policy search methods provide asymptotic local convergence guarantees by
construction, but it is not clear how much the policy improves within a small,
finite number of iterations. We show that guided policy search algorithms can
be interpreted as an approximate variant of mirror descent, where the
projection onto the constraint manifold is not exact. We derive a new guided
policy search algorithm that is simpler and provides appealing improvement and
convergence guarantees in simplified convex and linear settings, and show that
in the more general nonlinear setting, the error in the projection step can be
bounded. We provide empirical results on several simulated robotic navigation
and manipulation tasks that show that our method is stable and achieves similar
or better performance when compared to prior guided policy search methods, with
a simpler formulation and fewer hyperparameters.

 <dc:description>  Wireless Sensor Networks have emerged as one of the leading technologies.
These networks are designed to monitor crucial environmental parameters of
humidity, temperature, wind speed, soil moisture content, UV index, sound, etc.
and then transfer the required information to the base station. However,
security remains the key challenge of such networks as critical data is being
transferred. Most sensor nodes currently deployed have constraints on memory
and processing power and hence operate without an efficient security protocol.
Hereby a protocol which is lightweight and is secure for wireless sensor
applications is proposed.

 <dc:description>  Given the vast amounts of video available online, and recent breakthroughs in
object detection with static images, object detection in video offers a
promising new frontier. However, motion blur and compression artifacts cause
substantial frame-level variability, even in videos that appear smooth to the
eye. Additionally, video datasets tend to have sparsely annotated frames. We
present a new framework for improving object detection in videos that captures
temporal context and encourages consistency of predictions. First, we train a
pseudo-labeler, that is, a domain-adapted convolutional neural network for
object detection. The pseudo-labeler is first trained individually on the
subset of labeled frames, and then subsequently applied to all frames. Then we
train a recurrent neural network that takes as input sequences of
pseudo-labeled frames and optimizes an objective that encourages both accuracy
on the target frame and consistency across consecutive frames. The approach
incorporates strong supervision of target frames, weak-supervision on context
frames, and regularization via a smoothness penalty. Our approach achieves mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 68.73, an improvement of 7.1 over the strongest
image-based baselines for the Youtube-Video Objects dataset. Our experiments
demonstrate that neighboring frames can provide valuable information, even
absent labels.

 <dc:description>  Numerical models and computer-aided modeling software are tools commonly used
to assess the accessibility of an environment, based on static human body
dimensions. In this paper, the limits of validity of these approaches are
assessed by comparing the reach envelopes obtained by these methods to those
obtained experimentally. First, the accessibility areas of forty adult
subjects, which may correspond to the distance of reachability of products,
were evaluated by performing an accessibility task comprising 168 reach points.
Second, anthropometric characteristics of participants were recorded and used
to perform the reach assessment by a numerical method, and then by a CAD-based
analysis, where the reach was predicted using the software's maximum
reach-envelope generation. In spite of the simple nature of the presented
design problem (two-dimensional), the results show important differences
between the three methods. The study of the number of reached points shows that
the CAD-based assessment provides more accurate results than the numerical
model. Nevertheless, the shapes envelopes comparison indicates that the maximum
reach envelopes obtained with the CAD analysis are not always consistent with
those obtained experimentally, closely linked to the hand location. Results
indicate that the CAD model used to obtain maximum reaches gave predictions
that underestimate the reach ability.

 <dc:description>  We introduce inter-technology backscatter, a novel approach that transforms
wireless transmissions from one technology to another, on the air.
Specifically, we show for the first time that Bluetooth transmissions can be
used to create Wi-Fi and ZigBee-compatible signals using backscatter
communication. Since Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and ZigBee radios are widely available,
this approach enables a backscatter design that works using only commodity
devices.
  We build prototype backscatter hardware using an FPGA and experiment with
various Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and ZigBee devices. Our experiments show we can create
2-11 Mbps Wi-Fi standards-compliant signals by backscattering Bluetooth
transmissions. To show the generality of our approach, we also demonstrate
generation of standards-complaint ZigBee signals by backscattering Bluetooth
transmissions. Finally, we build proof-of-concepts for previously infeasible
applications including the first contact lens form-factor antenna prototype and
an implantable neural recording interface that communicate directly with
commodity devices such as smartphones and watches, thus enabling the vision of
Internet connected implanted devices.

 <dc:description>  This paper adapts a popular image quality measure called structural
similarity for high precision registration based tracking while also
introducing a simpler and faster variant of the same. Further, these are
evaluated comprehensively against existing measures using a unified approach to
study registration based trackers that decomposes them into three constituent
sub modules - appearance model, state space model and search method. Several
popular trackers in literature are broken down using this method so that their
contributions - as of this paper - are shown to be limited to only one or two
of these submodules. An open source tracking framework is made available that
follows this decomposition closely through extensive use of generic
programming. It is used to perform all experiments on four publicly available
datasets so the results are easily reproducible. This framework provides a
convenient interface to plug in a new method for any sub module and combine it
with existing methods for the other two. It can also serve as a fast and
flexible solution for practical tracking needs due to its highly efficient
implementation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a simple and computationally efficient quantization
scheme that enables us to reduce the resolution of the parameters of a neural
network from 32-bit floating point values to 8-bit integer values. The proposed
quantization scheme leads to significant memory savings and enables the use of
optimized hardware instructions for integer arithmetic, thus significantly
reducing the cost of inference. Finally, we propose a &quot;quantization aware&quot;
training process that applies the proposed scheme during network training and
find that it allows us to recover most of the loss in accuracy introduced by
quantization. We validate the proposed techniques by applying them to a long
short-term memory-based acoustic model on an open-ended large vocabulary speech
recognition task.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a probabilistic extension of Levy's Call-By-Push-Value. This
extension consists simply in adding a &quot; flipping coin &quot; boolean closed atomic
expression. This language can be understood as a major generalization of
Scott's PCF encompassing both call-by-name and call-by-value and featuring
recursive (possibly lazy) data types. We interpret the language in the
previously introduced denotational model of probabilistic coherence spaces, a
categorical model of full classical Linear Logic, interpreting data types as
coalgebras for the resource comonad. We prove adequacy and full abstraction,
generalizing earlier results to a much more realistic and powerful programming
language.

 <dc:description>  The emergence of new network applications is driving network operators to not
only fulfill dynamic bandwidth requirements, but offer various grades of
service. Degraded provisioning provides an effective solution to flexibly
allocate resources in various dimensions to reduce blocking for differentiated
demands when network congestion occurs. In this work, we investigate the novel
problem of online degraded provisioning in service-differentiated multi-layer
networks with optical elasticity. Quality of Service (QoS) is assured by
service-holding-time prolongation and immediate access as soon as the service
arrives without set-up delay. We decompose the problem into degraded routing
and degraded resource allocation stages, and design polynomial-time algorithms
with the enhanced multi-layer architecture to increase the network flexibility
in temporal and spectral dimensions. Illustrative results verify that we can
achieve significant reduction of network service failures, especially for
requests with higher priorities. The results also indicate that degradation in
optical layer can increase the network capacity, while the degradation in
electric layer provides flexible time-bandwidth exchange.

 <dc:description>  Energy harvesting communication has raised great research interests due to
its wide applications and feasibility of commercialization. In this paper, we
investigate the multiuser energy diversity. Specifically, we reveal the
throughput gain coming from the increase of total available energy harvested
over time/space and from the combined dynamics of batteries. Considering both
centralized and distributed access schemes, the scaling of the average
throughput over the number of transmitters is studied, along with the scaling
of corresponding available energy in the batteries.

 <dc:description>  This work presents a descending-price-auction algorithm to obtain the maximum
market-clearing price vector (MCP) in unit-demand matching markets with m items
by exploiting the combinatorial structure. With a shrewd choice of goods for
which the prices are reduced in each step, the algorithm only uses the
combinatorial structure, which avoids solving LPs and enjoys a strongly
polynomial runtime of $O(m^4)$. Critical to the algorithm is determining the
set of under-demanded goods for which we reduce the prices simultaneously in
each step of the algorithm. This we accomplish by choosing the subset of goods
that maximize a skewness function, which makes the bipartite graph series
converges to the combinatorial structure at the maximum MCP in $O(m^2)$ steps.
A graph coloring algorithm is proposed to find the set of goods with the
maximal skewness value that yields $O(m^4)$ complexity.

 <dc:title>Core spaces, sector spaces and fan spaces: a topological approach to

 <dc:description>  We present old and new characterizations of core spaces, alias worldwide web
spaces, originally defined by the existence of supercompact neighborhood bases.
The patch spaces of core spaces, obtained by joining the original topology with
a second topology having the dual specialization order, are the so-called
sector spaces, which have good convexity and separation properties and
determine the original space. The category of core spaces is shown to be
concretely isomorphic to the category of fan spaces; these are certain
quasi-ordered spaces having neighborhood bases of so-called fans, obtained by
deleting a finite number of principal filters from a principal filter. This
approach has useful consequences for domain theory. In fact, endowed with the
Scott topology, the continuous domains are nothing but the sober core spaces,
and endowed with the Lawson topology, they are the corresponding fan spaces. We
generalize the characterization of continuous lattices as meet-continuous
lattices with T$_2$ Lawson topology and extend the Fundamental Theorem of
Compact Semilattices to non-complete structures. Finally, we investigate
cardinal invariants like density and weight of the involved objects.

 <dc:description>  In the literature there exists analytical expressions for the probability of
a receiver decoding a transmitted source message that has been encoded using
random linear network coding. In this work, we look into the probability that
the receiver will decode at least a fraction of the source message, and present
an exact solution to this problem for both non-systematic and systematic
network coding. Based on the derived expressions, we investigate the potential
of these two implementations of network coding for information-theoretic secure
communication and progressive recovery of data.

 <dc:description>  Let $A^*$ denote the free monoid generated by a finite nonempty set $A.$ In
this paper we introduce a new measure of complexity of languages $L\subseteq
A^*$ defined in terms of the semigroup structure on $A^*.$ For each $L\subseteq
A^*,$ we define its {\it cost} $c(L)$ as the infimum of all real numbers
$\alpha$ for which there exist a language $S\subseteq A^*$ with
$p_S(n)=O(n^\alpha)$ and a positive integer $k$ with $L\subseteq S^k.$ We also
define the {\it cost dimension} $d_c(L)$ as the infimum of the set of all
positive integers $k$ such that $L\subseteq S^k$ for some language $S$ with
$p_S(n)=O(n^{c(L)}).$ We are primarily interested in languages $L$ given by the
set of factors of an infinite word $x=x_0x_1x_2\cdots \in A^\omega$ of zero
topological entropy, in which case $c(L)&lt;+\infty.$ We establish the following
characterisation of words of linear factor complexity: Let $x\in A^\omega$ and
$L=$Fac$(x)$ be the set of factors of $x.$ Then $p_x(n)=\Theta(n)$ if and only
$c(L)=0$ and $d_c(L)=2.$ In other words, $p_x(n)=O(n)$ if and only if
Fac$(x)\subseteq S^2$ for some language $S\subseteq A^+$ of bounded complexity
(meaning $\limsup p_S(n)&lt;+\infty).$ In general the cost of a language $L$
reflects deeply the underlying combinatorial structure induced by the semigroup
structure on $A^*.$ For example, in contrast to the above characterisation of
languages generated by words of sub-linear complexity, there exist non
factorial languages $L$ of complexity $p_L(n)=O(\log n)$ (and hence of cost
equal to $0)$ and of cost dimension $+\infty.$ In this paper we investigate the
cost and cost dimension of languages defined by infinite words of zero
topological entropy.

 <dc:description>  Driven by growing spectrum shortage, Long-term Evolution in unlicensed
spectrum (LTE-U) has recently been proposed as a new paradigm to deliver better
performance and experience for mobile users by extending the LTE protocol to
unlicensed spectrum. In the paper, we first present a comprehensive overview of
the LTE-U technology, and discuss the practical challenges it faces. We
summarize the existing LTE-U operation modes and analyze several means for
LTE-U coexistence with Wi-Fi medium access control protocols. We further
propose a novel hyper access-point (HAP) that integrates the functionalities of
LTE small cell base station and commercial Wi-Fi AP for deployment by cellular
network operators. Our proposed LTE-U access embedding within the Wi-Fi
protocol is non-disruptive to unlicensed Wi-Fi nodes and demonstrates
performance benefits as a seamless and novel LTE and Wi-Fi coexistence
technology in unlicensed band. We provide results to demonstrate the
performances advantage of this novel LTE-U proposal.

 <dc:description>  Computational saliency models for still images have gained significant
popularity in recent years. Saliency prediction from videos, on the other hand,
has received relatively little interest from the community. Motivated by this,
in this work, we study the use of deep learning for dynamic saliency prediction
and propose the so-called spatio-temporal saliency networks. The key to our
models is the architecture of two-stream networks where we investigate
different fusion mechanisms to integrate spatial and temporal information. We
evaluate our models on the DIEM and UCF-Sports datasets and present highly
competitive results against the existing state-of-the-art models. We also carry
out some experiments on a number of still images from the MIT300 dataset by
exploiting the optical flow maps predicted from these images. Our results show
that considering inherent motion information in this way can be helpful for
static saliency estimation.

 <dc:description>  Object detection is an import task of computer vision.A variety of methods
have been proposed,but methods using the weak labels still do not have a
satisfactory result.In this paper,we propose a new framework that using the
weakly supervised method's output as the pseudo-strong labels to train a
strongly supervised model.One weakly supervised method is treated as black-box
to generate class-specific bounding boxes on train dataset.A de-noise method is
then applied to the noisy bounding boxes.Then the de-noised pseudo-strong
labels are used to train a strongly object detection network.The whole
framework is still weakly supervised because the entire process only uses the
image-level labels.The experiment results on PASCAL VOC 2007 prove the validity
of our framework, and we get result 43.4% on mean average precision compared to
39.5% of the previous best result and 34.5% of the initial
method,respectively.And this frame work is simple and distinct,and is promising
to be applied to other method easily.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of stochastic approximation
schemes with set-valued drift function and non-additive iterate-dependent
Markov noise. We show that a linearly interpolated trajectory of such a
recursion is an asymptotic pseudotrajectory for the flow of a limiting
differential inclusion obtained by averaging the set-valued drift function of
the recursion w.r.t. the stationary distributions of the Markov noise. The
limit set theorem in [1] is then used to characterize the limit sets of the
recursion in terms of the dynamics of the limiting differential inclusion. We
then state two variants of the Markov noise assumption under which the analysis
of the recursion is similar to the one presented in this paper. Scenarios where
our recursion naturally appears are presented as applications. These include
controlled stochastic approximation, subgradient descent, approximate drift
problem and analysis of discontinuous dynamics all in the presence of
non-additive iterate-dependent Markov noise.

 <dc:description>  In social network analysis, automatic social circle detection in ego-networks
is becoming a fundamental and important task, with many potential applications
such as user privacy protection or interest group recommendation. So far, most
studies have focused on addressing two questions, namely, how to detect
overlapping circles and how to detect circles using a combination of network
structure and network node attributes. This paper asks an orthogonal research
question, that is, how to detect circles based on network structures that are
(usually) described by multiple views? Our investigation begins with crawling
ego-networks from Twitter and employing classic techniques to model their
structures by six views, including user relationships, user interactions and
user content. We then apply both standard and our modified multi-view spectral
clustering techniques to detect social circles in these ego-networks. Based on
extensive automatic and manual experimental evaluations, we deliver two major
findings: first, multi-view clustering techniques perform better than common
single-view clustering techniques, which only use one view or naively integrate
all views for detection, second, the standard multi-view clustering technique
is less robust than our modified technique, which selectively transfers
information across views based on an assumption that sparse network structures
are (potentially) incomplete. In particular, the second finding makes us
believe a direct application of standard clustering on potentially incomplete
networks may yield biased results. We lightly examine this issue in theory,
where we derive an upper bound for such bias by integrating theories of
spectral clustering and matrix perturbation, and discuss how it may be affected
by several network characteristics.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we analyze the benefits of including downlink pilots in a
cell-free massive MIMO system. We derive an approximate per-user achievable
downlink rate for conjugate beamforming processing, which takes into account
both uplink and downlink channel estimation errors, and power control. A
performance comparison is carried out, in terms of per-user net throughput,
considering cell-free massive MIMO operation with and without downlink
training, for different network densities. We take also into account the
performance improvement provided by max-min fairness power control in the
downlink. Numerical results show that, exploiting downlink pilots, the
performance can be considerably improved in low density networks over the
conventional scheme where the users rely on statistical channel knowledge only.
In high density networks, performance improvements are moderate.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops an optimization framework for self-organizing networks
(SON). The objective is to ensure efficient network operation by a joint
optimization of different SON functionalities, which includes capacity,
coverage and load balancing. Based on the axiomatic framework of monotone and
strictly subhomogeneous function, we formulate an optimization problem for the
uplink and propose a two-step optimization scheme using fixed point iterations:
i) per base station antenna tilt optimization and power allocation, and ii)
cluster-based base station assignment of users and power allocation. We then
consider the downlink, which is more difficult to handle due to coupled
variables, and show downlink-uplink duality relationship. As a result, a
solution for the downlink is obtained by solving the uplink problem.
Simulations show that our approach achieves a good trade-off between coverage,
capacity and load balancing.

 <dc:description>  The construction of $r$-nets offers a powerful tool in computational and
metric geometry. We focus on high-dimensional spaces and present a new
randomized algorithm which efficiently computes approximate $r$-nets with
respect to Euclidean distance. For any fixed $\epsilon&gt;0$, the approximation
factor is $1+\epsilon$ and the complexity is polynomial in the dimension and
subquadratic in the number of points. The algorithm succeeds with high
probability. More specifically, the best previously known LSH-based
construction of Eppstein et al.\ \cite{EHS15} is improved in terms of
complexity by reducing the dependence on $\epsilon$, provided that $\epsilon$
is sufficiently small. Our method does not require LSH but, instead, follows
Valiant's \cite{Val15} approach in designing a sequence of reductions of our
problem to other problems in different spaces, under Euclidean distance or
inner product, for which $r$-nets are computed efficiently and the error can be
controlled. Our result immediately implies efficient solutions to a number of
geometric problems in high dimension, such as finding the
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate $k$th nearest neighbor distance in time subquadratic
in the size of the input.

 <dc:title>New version of Gram-Schmidt Process with inverse for Signal and Image

 <dc:creator>Mastriani, Mario</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Gram-Schmidt Process (GSP) is used to convert a non-orthogonal basis (a
set of linearly independent vectors, matrices, etc) into an orthonormal basis
(a set of orthogonal, unit-length vectors, bi or tri dimensional matrices). The
process consists of taking each array and then subtracting the projections in
common with the previous arrays. This paper introduces an enhanced version of
the Gram-Schmidt Process (EGSP) with inverse, which is useful for Digital
Signal and Image Processing, among others applications.

 <dc:description>  Lumen Social Robot is a humanoid robot development with the purpose that it
could be a good friend to all people. In this year, the Lumen Social Robot is
being developed into a guide in the exhibition and in the seminar of the Final
Exam of undergraduate and graduate students in Electrical Engineering ITB,
named Electrical Engineering Days 2015. In order to be the guide in that
occasion, Lumen is supported by several things. They are Nao robot components,
servers, and multiple processor systems. The image processing system is a
processing application system that allows Lumen to recognize and determine an
object from the image taken from the camera eye. The image processing system is
provided with four modules. They are face detection module to detect a person's
face, face recognition module to recognize a person's face, face tracking
module to follow a person's face, and human detection module to detect humans
based on the upper parts of person's body. Face detection module and human
detection module are implemented by using the library harcascade.xml on EMGU
CV. Face recognition module is implemented by adding the database for the face
that has been detected and store it in that database. Face tracking module is
implemented by using the Smooth Gaussian filter to the image.

 <dc:description>  Social Robot Lumen is an Artificial Intelligence development project that
aims to create an Artificial Intelligence (AI) which allows a humanoid robot to
communicate with human being naturally. In this study, Lumen will be developed
to be a tour guide in Electrical Engineering Days 2015 exhibition. In
developing an AI, there are a lot of modules that need to be developed
separately. To make the development easier, we need a computational platform
which becomes basis for all developers to give easiness in developing the
modules in parallel way. That computational platform that developed by the
writer is called Lumen Server. Lumen Server has two main function, which are to
be a bridge between all Lumen intelligence modules with NAO robot, and to be
the communication bridge between those Lumen intelligence modules. For the
second function, Lumen Server implements the AMQP protocol using RabbitMQ.
Besides that, writer also developed a control system for robot movement called
Lumen Motion. Lumen motion is implemented by modelling the movement of NAO
robot and also by creating a control system using fuzzy logic controller.
Writer also developed a program that connects all Lumen intelligence modules so
that Lumen can act like a tour guide. The implementation of this program uses
FSM and event-driven program. From implementation result, all the features
which were designed are successfully implemented. By the developing of this
computational platform, it can ease the development of Lumen in the future. For
next development, it must be focused on creating integration system so that
Lumen can be more responsive to the environment.

 <dc:title>Optimized Automatic Code Generation for Geometric Algebra Based

 <dc:description>  Automatic code generation for low-dimensional geometric algorithms is capable
of producing efficient low-level software code through a high-level geometric
domain specific language. Geometric Algebra (GA) is one of the most suitable
algebraic systems for being the base for such code generator. This work
presents an attempt at realizing such idea in practice. A novel GA-based
geometric code generator, called GMac, is proposed. Comparisons to similar
GA-based code generators are provided. The possibility of fully benefiting from
the symbolic power of GA while obtaining good performance and maintainability
of software implementations is illustrated through a ray tracing application.

whether you are stress, depressed, caught by influenza or not. We will use the
heart rate data taken for months in Bandung, analyze the data and find the
Heart rate variance that constantly related with the stress and flu level.
After we found the variable, we will use the variable as an input to the
support vector machine learning. We will use the lagrangian and kernel
technique to transform 2D data into 3D data so we can use the linear
classification in 3D space. In the end, we could use the machine learning's
result to classify new data and get the final result immediately: stress or
not, influenza or not.

 <dc:description>  3D extended field of views (FOVs) of the internal bladder wall facilitate
lesion diagnosis, patient follow-up and treatment traceability. In this paper,
we propose a 3D image mosaicing algorithm guided by 2D cystoscopic video-image
registration for obtaining textured FOV mosaics. In this feasibility study, the
registration makes use of data from a 3D cystoscope prototype providing, in
addition to each small FOV image, some 3D points located on the surface. This
proof of concept shows that textured surfaces can be constructed with minimally
modified cystoscopes. The potential of the method is demonstrated on numerical
and real phantoms reproducing various surface shapes. Pig and human bladder
textures are superimposed on phantoms with known shape and dimensions. These
data allow for quantitative assessment of the 3D mosaicing algorithm based on
the registration of images simulating bladder textures.

 <dc:title>The Security of Organizations and Individuals in Online Social Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Elyashar, Aviad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The serious privacy and security problems related to online social networks
(OSNs) are what fueled two complementary studies as part of this thesis. In the
first study, we developed a general algorithm for the mining of data of
targeted organizations by using Facebook (currently the most popular OSN) and
socialbots. By friending employees in a targeted organization, our active
socialbots were able to find new employees and informal organizational links
that we could not find by crawling with passive socialbots. We evaluated our
method on the Facebook OSN and were able to reconstruct the social networks of
employees in three distinct, actual organizations. Furthermore, in the crawling
process with our active socialbots we discovered up to 13.55% more employees
and 22.27% more informal organizational links in contrast to the crawling
process that was performed by passive socialbots with no company associations
as friends.
  In our second study, we developed a general algorithm for reaching specific
OSN users who declared themselves to be employees of targeted organizations,
using the topologies of organizational social networks and utilizing
socialbots. We evaluated the proposed method on targeted users from three
actual organizations on Facebook, and two actual organizations on the Xing OSN
(another popular OSN platform). Eventually, our socialbots were able to reach
specific users with a success rate of up to 70% on Facebook, and up to 60% on
Xing.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new framework of identifying a series of cyber data
attacks on power system synchrophasor measurements. We focus on detecting
&quot;unobservable&quot; cyber data attacks that cannot be detected by any existing
method that purely relies on measurements received at one time instant.
Leveraging the approximate low-rank property of phasor measurement unit (PMU)
data, we formulate the identification problem of successive unobservable cyber
attacks as a matrix decomposition problem of a low-rank matrix plus a
transformed column-sparse matrix. We propose a convex-optimization-based method
and provide its theoretical guarantee in the data identification. Numerical
experiments on actual PMU data from the Central New York power system and
synthetic data are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

 <dc:description>  A tropical graph $(H,c)$ consists of a graph $H$ and a (not necessarily
proper) vertex-colouring $c$ of $H$. Given two tropical graphs $(G,c_1)$ and
$(H,c)$, a homomorphism of $(G,c_1)$ to $(H,c)$ is a standard graph
homomorphism of $G$ to $H$ that also preserves the vertex-colours. We initiate
the study of the computational complexity of tropical graph homomorphism
problems. We consider two settings. First, when the tropical graph $(H,c)$ is
fixed; this is a problem called $(H,c)$-COLOURING. Second, when the colouring
of $H$ is part of the input; the associated decision problem is called
$H$-TROPICAL-COLOURING. Each $(H,c)$-COLOURING problem is a constraint
satisfaction problem (CSP), and we show that a complexity dichotomy for the
class of $(H,c)$-COLOURING problems holds if and only if the Feder-Vardi
Dichotomy Conjecture for CSPs is true. This implies that $(H,c)$-COLOURING
problems form a rich class of decision problems. On the other hand, we were
successful in classifying the complexity of at least certain classes of
$H$-TROPICAL-COLOURING problems.

 <dc:description>  Learning video concept detectors automatically from the big but noisy web
data with no additional manual annotations is a novel but challenging area in
the multimedia and the machine learning community. A considerable amount of
videos on the web are associated with rich but noisy contextual information,
such as the title, which provides weak annotations or labels about the video
content. To leverage the big noisy web labels, this paper proposes a novel
method called WEbly-Labeled Learning (WELL), which is established on the
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm inspired by the learning process of
human. WELL introduces a number of novel multi-modal approaches to incorporate
meaningful prior knowledge called curriculum from the noisy web videos. To
investigate this problem, we empirically study the curriculum constructed from
the multi-modal features of the videos collected from YouTube and Flickr. The
efficacy and the scalability of WELL have been extensively demonstrated on two
public benchmarks, including the largest multimedia dataset and the largest
manually-labeled video set. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate
that WELL outperforms state-of-the-art studies by a statically significant
margin on learning concepts from noisy web video data. In addition, the results
also verify that WELL is robust to the level of noisiness in the video data.
Notably, WELL trained on sufficient noisy web labels is able to achieve a
comparable accuracy to supervised learning methods trained on the clean
manually-labeled data.

 <dc:description>  An instance of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) is given by a family
of constraints on overlapping sets of variables, and the goal is to assign
values from a fixed domain to the variables so that all constraints are
satisfied. In the optimization version, the goal is to maximize the number of
satisfied constraints. An approximation algorithm for CSP is called robust if
it outputs an assignment satisfying a $(1-g(\varepsilon))$-fraction of
constraints on any $(1-\varepsilon)$-satisfiable instance, where the loss
function $g$ is such that $g(\varepsilon)\rightarrow 0$ as
$\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$.
  We study how the robust approximability of CSPs depends on the set of
constraint relations allowed in instances, the so-called constraint language.
All constraint languages admitting a robust polynomial-time algorithm (with
some $g$) have been characterised by Barto and Kozik, with the general bound on
the loss $g$ being doubly exponential, specifically
$g(\varepsilon)=O((\log\log(1/\varepsilon))/\log(1/\varepsilon))$. It is
natural to ask when a better loss can be achieved: in particular, polynomial
loss $g(\varepsilon)=O(\varepsilon^{1/k})$ for some constant $k$. In this
paper, we consider CSPs with a constraint language having a near-unanimity
polymorphism. We give two randomized robust algorithms with polynomial loss for
such CSPs: one works for any near-unanimity polymorphism and the parameter $k$
in the loss depends on the size of the domain and the arity of the relations in
$\Gamma$, while the other works for a special ternary near-unanimity operation
called dual discriminator with $k=2$ for any domain size. In the latter case,
the CSP is a common generalisation of Unique Games with a fixed domain and
2-SAT. In the former case, we use the algebraic approach to the CSP. Both cases
use the standard semidefinite programming relaxation for CSP.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel approach to perform probabilistic collision detection
between a high-DOF robot and high-DOF obstacles in dynamic, uncertain
environments. In dynamic environments with a high-DOF robot and moving
obstacles, our approach efficiently computes accurate collision probability
between the robot and obstacles with upper error bounds. Furthermore, we
describe a prediction algorithm for future obstacle position and motion that
accounts for both spatial and temporal uncertainties. We present a trajectory
optimization algorithm for high-DOF robots in dynamic, uncertain environments
based on probabilistic collision detection. We highlight motion planning
performance in challenging scenarios with robot arms operating in environments
with dynamically moving human obstacles.

 <dc:title>Sieving for closest lattice vectors (with preprocessing)</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Laarhoven, Thijs</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Lattice-based cryptography has recently emerged as a prime candidate for
efficient and secure post-quantum cryptography. The two main hard problems
underlying its security are the shortest vector problem (SVP) and the closest
vector problem (CVP). Various algorithms have been studied for solving these
problems, and for SVP, lattice sieving currently dominates in terms of the
asymptotic time complexity: one can heuristically solve SVP in time
$2^{0.292d}$ in high dimensions $d$ [BDGL'16]. Although several SVP algorithms
can also be used to solve CVP, it is not clear whether this also holds for
heuristic lattice sieving methods. The best time complexity for CVP is
currently $2^{0.377d}$ [BGJ'14].
  In this paper we revisit sieving algorithms for solving SVP, and study how
these algorithms can be modified to solve CVP and its variants as well. Our
first method is aimed at solving one problem instance and minimizes the overall
time complexity for a single CVP instance with a time complexity of
$2^{0.292d}$. Our second method minimizes the amortized time complexity for
several instances on the same lattice, at the cost of a larger preprocessing
cost. We can solve the closest vector problem with preprocessing (CVPP) with
$2^{0.636d}$ space and preprocessing, in $2^{0.136d}$ time, while the query
complexity can even be reduced to $2^{\epsilon d}$ at the cost of preprocessing
time and memory complexities of $(1/\epsilon)^{O(d)}$.
  For easier variants of CVP, such as approximate CVP and bounded distance
decoding (BDD), we further show how the preprocessing method achieves even
better complexities. For instance, we can solve approximate CVPP with large
approximation factors $k$ with polynomial-sized advice in polynomial time if $k
= \Omega(\sqrt{d/\log d})$, heuristically closing the gap between the
decision-CVPP result of [AR'04] and the search-CVPP result of [DRS'14].

 <dc:description>  A novel deep learning method for improving the belief propagation algorithm
is proposed. The method generalizes the standard belief propagation algorithm
by assigning weights to the edges of the Tanner graph. These edges are then
trained using deep learning techniques. A well-known property of the belief
propagation algorithm is the independence of the performance on the transmitted
codeword. A crucial property of our new method is that our decoder preserved
this property. Furthermore, this property allows us to learn only a single
codeword instead of exponential number of code-words. Improvements over the
belief propagation algorithm are demonstrated for various high density parity
check codes.

 <dc:title>Collision detection or nearest-neighbor search? On the computational

 <dc:description>  The complexity of nearest-neighbor search dominates the asymptotic running
time of many sampling-based motion-planning algorithms. However, collision
detection is often considered to be the computational bottleneck in practice.
Examining various asymptotically optimal planning algorithms, we characterize
settings, which we call NN-sensitive, in which the practical computational role
of nearest-neighbor search is far from being negligible, i.e., the portion of
running time taken up by nearest-neighbor search is comparable, or sometimes
even greater than the portion of time taken up by collision detection. This
reinforces and substantiates the claim that motion-planning algorithms could
significantly benefit from efficient and possibly specifically-tailored
nearest-neighbor data structures. The asymptotic (near) optimality of these
algorithms relies on a prescribed connection radius, defining a ball around a
configuration $q$, such that $q$ needs to be connected to all other
configurations in that ball. To facilitate our study, we show how to adapt this
radius to non-Euclidean spaces, which are prevalent in motion planning. This
technical result is of independent interest, as it enables to compare the
radial-connection approach with the common alternative, namely, connecting each
configuration to its $k$ nearest neighbors ($k$-NN). Indeed, as we demonstrate,
there are scenarios where using the radial connection scheme, a solution path
of a specific cost is produced ten-fold (and more) faster than with $k$-NN.

 <dc:description>  For more than two centuries, solutions of differential equations have been
obtained either analytically or numerically based on typically well-behaved
forcing and boundary conditions for well-posed problems. We are changing this
paradigm in a fundamental way by establishing an interface between
probabilistic machine learning and differential equations. We develop
data-driven algorithms for general linear equations using Gaussian process
priors tailored to the corresponding integro-differential operators. The only
observables are scarce noisy multi-fidelity data for the forcing and solution
that are not required to reside on the domain boundary. The resulting
predictive posterior distributions quantify uncertainty and naturally lead to
adaptive solution refinement via active learning. This general framework
circumvents the tyranny of numerical discretization as well as the consistency
and stability issues of time-integration, and is scalable to high-dimensions.

representation languages in use on the Web, propelled by the recommendation of
the W3C. In this paper we present a practical implementation of a different
kind of knowledge representation based on Prototypes. In detail, we present a
concrete syntax easily and effectively parsable by applications. We also
present extensible implementations of a prototype knowledge base, specifically
designed for storage of Prototypes. These implementations are written in Java
and can be extended by using the implementation as a library. Alternatively,
the software can be deployed as such. Further, results of benchmarks for both
local and web deployment are presented. This paper augments a research paper,
in which we describe the more theoretical aspects of our Prototype system.

 <dc:description>  Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure have been an issue of importance in
industry over the past several years, as well as a focus of academic research.
Cyber attacks of various types and magnitude have been on the rise targeted
specifically at power grids. A successful attack on the power grid could result
in significant impacts including grid shutdown, cascading failures, damage to
the infrastructure, and potential harm to people. Power grid infrastructure are
critical in nature, they enable operations for residential, commercial,
industrial, and government users across critical infrastructure such as water,
communication, banking, transportation, manufacturing, and more. The compromise
of these operations introduces threats, which span from economic to public
safety. The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is now being rapidly
deployed throughout the power grid, and is an enabling technology for smart
grid. Identifying the attack surface is a necessary step in achieving cyber
security in smart grids and AMI. The purpose of this paper is to quantify and
examine the cyber attack surface of AMI in order to lay the foundation for
mitigating approaches to AMI cyber security.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The architecture is developed for incorporating a software agent into the
existing control system of a river-based hydro generating plant. The software
agent will utilize a rule-based system for ease of integration. Optimization
for increased power production is presented, initially for a single generating
unit. An enhancement to facilitate the constraints of river level and flow by
an external user as well as the goals of corporate dispatching is then
developed through the existing SCADA system. Finally, expansion to coordinate
multiple hydro units at a single location is presented.

 <dc:description>  The interplay between coding theory and $t$-designs started many years ago.
While every $t$-design yields a linear code over every finite field, the
largest $t$ for which an infinite family of $t$-designs is derived directly
from a linear or nonlinear code is $t=3$. Sporadic $4$-designs and $5$-designs
were derived from some linear codes of certain parameters. The major objective
of this paper is to construct many infinite families of $2$-designs and
$3$-designs from linear codes. The parameters of some known $t$-designs are
also derived. In addition, many conjectured infinite families of $2$-designs
are also presented.

 <dc:description>  A set of software metrics for the evaluation of power management systems
(PMSs) is presented. Such systems for managing power need to be autonomous,
scalable, low in complexity, and comprised of portable algorithms in order to
be well applied across the varying implementations that utilize power systems.
Although similar metrics exist for software in general, their definitions do
not readily lend themselves to the unique characteristics of power management
systems or systems of similar architecture.

 <dc:description>  It has been known for a long time that $t$-designs can be employed to
construct both linear and nonlinear codes and that the codewords of a fixed
weight in a code may hold a $t$-design. While a lot of progress in the
direction of constructing codes from $t$-designs has been made, only a small
amount of work on the construction of $t$-designs from codes has been done. The
objective of this paper is to construct infinite families of $2$-designs and
$3$-designs from a type of binary linear codes with five-weights. The total
number of $2$-designs and $3$-designs obtained in this paper are exponential in
any odd $m$ and the block size of the designs varies in a huge range.

 <dc:title>Microgrid Reference Methodology for Understanding Utility and Customer
  Interactions in Microgrid Projects</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pacheco, Franklin E.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Foreman, James Christopher</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is to introduce a holistic and systematic approach,
based in key concepts of systems thinking, systems of systems and management
science; to completely represent, model and analyze microgrid systems. In this
paper we propose a Microgrid Reference Methodology (MRM) that guides the
cooperation and mutual benefits between electric utilities and industrial
customers for microgrid projects. We sketch a four-level socio-technical system
in which the {\delta} (business) level is added to the other three levels that
are traditionally analyzed in microgrid design and planning. This MRM clearly
specifies the steps and processes necessary for determining actors in the
system, their interrelations, interests, goals and undesired effects. Finally,
the MRM makes possible the evaluation of the impact of different alternatives
on the objectives of both parties through the determination of criteria and
factors. These factors can be influenced by the electric utility and customer;
or they can be external, but still influenced by other actors such as
regulators and government, to incentivize the implementation of microgrid
projects.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers global optimization with a black-box unknown objective
function that can be non-convex and non-differentiable. Such a difficult
optimization problem arises in many real-world applications, such as parameter
tuning in machine learning, engineering design problem, and planning with a
complex physics simulator. This paper proposes a new global optimization
algorithm, called Locally Oriented Global Optimization (LOGO), to aim for both
fast convergence in practice and finite-time error bound in theory. The
advantage and usage of the new algorithm are illustrated via theoretical
analysis and an experiment conducted with 11 benchmark test functions. Further,
we modify the LOGO algorithm to specifically solve a planning problem via
policy search with continuous state/action space and long time horizon while
maintaining its finite-time error bound. We apply the proposed planning method
to accident management of a nuclear power plant. The result of the application
study demonstrates the practical utility of our method.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel asynchronous parallel algorithmic framework for the
minimization of the sum of a smooth nonconvex function and a convex nonsmooth
regularizer, subject to both convex and nonconvex constraints. The proposed
framework hinges on successive convex approximation techniques and a novel
probabilistic model that captures key elements of modern computational
architectures and asynchronous implementations in a more faithful way than
current state of the art models. Key features of the proposed framework are: i)
it accommodates inconsistent read, meaning that components of the vector
variables may be written by some cores while being simultaneously read by
others; ii) it covers in a unified way several different specific solution
methods, and iii) it accommodates a variety of possible parallel computing
architectures. Almost sure convergence to stationary solutions is proved.
Numerical results, reported in the companion paper, on both convex and
nonconvex problems show our method can consistently outperform existing
parallel asynchronous algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We propose a modified decomposition algorithm (MDA) to solve the asymptotic
communication for omniscience (CO) problem where the communication rates could
be real or fractional. By starting with a lower estimation of the minimum
sum-rate, the MDA algorithm iteratively updates the estimation by the optimizer
of a Dilworth truncation problem until the minimum is reached with a
corresponding optimal rate vector. We also propose a fusion method
implementation of the coordinate-wise saturation capacity algorithm
(CoordSatCapFus) for solving the Dilworth truncation problem, where the
minimization is done over a fused user set with a cardinality smaller than the
original one. We show that the MDA algorithm is less complex than the existing
ones. In addition, we show that the non-asymptotic CO problem, where the
communication rates are integral, can be solved by one more call of the
CoordSatCapfus algorithm. By choosing a proper linear ordering of the user
indices in the MDA algorithm, the optimal rate vector is also the one with the
minimum weighted sum-rate.

 <dc:description>  Every database system contains a query optimizer that performs query
rewrites. Unfortunately, developing query optimizers remains a highly
challenging task. Part of the challenges comes from the intricacies and rich
features of query languages, which makes reasoning about rewrite rules
difficult. In this paper, we propose a machine-checkable denotational semantics
for SQL, the de facto language for relational database, for rigorously
validating rewrite rules. Unlike previously proposed semantics that are either
non-mechanized or only cover a small amount of SQL language features, our
semantics covers all major features of SQL, including bags, correlated
subqueries, aggregation, and indexes. Our mechanized semantics, called HoTTSQL,
is based on K-Relations and homotopy type theory, where we denote relations as
mathematical functions from tuples to univalent types. We have implemented
HoTTSQL in Coq, which takes only fewer than 300 lines of code and have proved a
wide range of SQL rewrite rules, including those from database research
literature (e.g., magic set rewrites) and real-world query optimizers (e.g.,
subquery elimination). Several of these rewrite rules have never been
previously proven correct. In addition, while query equivalence is generally
undecidable, we have implemented an automated decision procedure using HoTTSQL
for conjunctive queries: a well-studied decidable fragment of SQL that
encompasses many real-world queries.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents the plnauty~library, a Prolog interface to the nauty
graph-automorphism tool. Adding the capabilities of nauty to Prolog combines
the strength of the &quot;generate and prune&quot; approach that is commonly used in
logic programming and constraint solving, with the ability to reduce symmetries
while reasoning over graph objects. Moreover, it enables the integration of
nauty in existing tool-chains, such as SAT-solvers or finite domain constraints
compilers which exist for Prolog. The implementation consists of two
components: plnauty, an interface connecting \nauty's C library with Prolog,
and plgtools, a Prolog framework integrating the software component of nauty,
called gtools, with Prolog. The complete tool is available as a SWI-Prolog
module. We provide a series of usage examples including two that apply to
generate Ramsey graphs. This paper is under consideration for publication in
TPLP.

 <dc:title>Belief propagation decoding of quantum channels by passing quantum

 <dc:creator>Renes, Joseph M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Belief propagation is a powerful tool in statistical physics, machine
learning, and modern coding theory. As a decoding method, it is ubiquitous in
classical error correction and has also been applied to stabilizer-based
quantum error correction. The algorithm works by passing messages between nodes
of the factor graph associated with the code and enables efficient decoding, in
some cases even up to the Shannon capacity of the channel. Here we construct a
belief propagation algorithm which passes quantum messages on the factor graph
and is capable of decoding the classical-quantum channel with pure state
outputs. This gives explicit decoding circuits whose number of gates is
quadratic in the blocklength of the code. We also show that this decoder can be
modified to work with polar codes for the pure state channel and as part of a
polar decoder for transmitting quantum information over the amplitude damping
channel. These represent the first explicit capacity-achieving decoders for
non-Pauli channels.

 <dc:description>  The minrank of a graph $G$ is the minimum rank of a matrix $M$ that can be
obtained from the adjacency matrix of $G$ by switching some ones to zeros
(i.e., deleting edges) and then setting all diagonal entries to one. This
quantity is closely related to the fundamental information-theoretic problems
of (linear) index coding (Bar-Yossef et al., FOCS'06), network coding and
distributed storage, and to Valiant's approach for proving superlinear circuit
lower bounds (Valiant, Boolean Function Complexity '92).
  We prove tight bounds on the minrank of random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs
$G(n,p)$ for all regimes of $p\in[0,1]$. In particular, for any constant $p$,
we show that $\mathsf{minrk}(G) = \Theta(n/\log n)$ with high probability,
where $G$ is chosen from $G(n,p)$. This bound gives a near quadratic
improvement over the previous best lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ (Haviv and
Langberg, ISIT'12), and partially settles an open problem raised by Lubetzky
and Stav (FOCS '07). Our lower bound matches the well-known upper bound
obtained by the &quot;clique covering&quot; solution, and settles the linear index coding
problem for random graphs.
  Finally, our result suggests a new avenue of attack, via derandomization, on
Valiant's approach for proving superlinear lower bounds for logarithmic-depth
semilinear circuits.

 <dc:description>  The principal goal of Group Testing (GT) is to identify a small subset of
&quot;defective&quot; items from a large population, by grouping items into as few test
pools as possible. The test outcome of a pool is positive if it contains at
least one defective item, and is negative otherwise. GT algorithms are utilized
in numerous applications, and in many of them maintaining the privacy of the
tested items, namely, keeping secret whether they are defective or not, is
critical.
  In this paper, we consider a scenario where there is an eavesdropper (Eve)
who is able to observe a subset of the GT outcomes (pools). We propose a new
non-adaptive Secure Group Testing (SGT) algorithm based on
information-theoretic principles, which keeps the eavesdropper ignorant
regarding the items' status. Specifically, when the fraction of tests observed
by Eve is $0 \leq \delta &lt;1$, we prove that the number of tests required for
both correct reconstruction at the legitimate user (with high probability) and
negligible information leakage to Eve is $\frac{1}{1-\delta}$ times the number
of tests required with no secrecy constraint \revised{for fixed $K$ regime. By
a matching converse, we completely characterize the Secure GT capacity.
Moreover, we consider a computationally efficient decoding algorithm, and prove
that for $\delta &lt; 1/2$ the number of tests required, without any constraint on
$K$, is at most $\frac{1}{1/2-\delta}$ times the number of tests required with
no secrecy constraint.

 <dc:title>An Empirical Evaluation of various Deep Learning Architectures for

 <dc:description>  Several tasks in argumentation mining and debating, question-answering, and
natural language inference involve classifying a sequence in the context of
another sequence (referred as bi-sequence classification). For several single
sequence classification tasks, the current state-of-the-art approaches are
based on recurrent and convolutional neural networks. On the other hand, for
bi-sequence classification problems, there is not much understanding as to the
best deep learning architecture. In this paper, we attempt to get an
understanding of this category of problems by extensive empirical evaluation of
19 different deep learning architectures (specifically on different ways of
handling context) for various problems originating in natural language
processing like debating, textual entailment and question-answering. Following
the empirical evaluation, we offer our insights and conclusions regarding the
architectures we have considered. We also establish the first deep learning
baselines for three argumentation mining tasks.

 <dc:description>  Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a powerful tool for understanding human
behaviour. Applying HAR to wearable sensors can provide new insights by
enriching the feature set in health studies, and enhance the personalisation
and effectiveness of health, wellness, and fitness applications. Wearable
devices provide an unobtrusive platform for user monitoring, and due to their
increasing market penetration, feel intrinsic to the wearer. The integration of
these devices in daily life provide a unique opportunity for understanding
human health and wellbeing. This is referred to as the &quot;quantified self&quot;
movement. The analyses of complex health behaviours such as sleep,
traditionally require a time-consuming manual interpretation by experts. This
manual work is necessary due to the erratic periodicity and persistent
noisiness of human behaviour. In this paper, we present a robust automated
human activity recognition algorithm, which we call RAHAR. We test our
algorithm in the application area of sleep research by providing a novel
framework for evaluating sleep quality and examining the correlation between
the aforementioned and an individual's physical activity. Our results improve
the state-of-the-art procedure in sleep research by 15 percent for area under
ROC and by 30 percent for F1 score on average. However, application of RAHAR is
not limited to sleep analysis and can be used for understanding other health
problems such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiac diseases.

 <dc:title>Stochastic Broadcast Control of Multi-Agent Swarms</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We present a model for controlling swarms of mobile agents via broadcast
control, assumed to be detected by a random set of agents in the swarm. The
agents that detect the control signal become ad-hoc leaders of the swarm. The
agents are assumed to be velocity controlled, identical, anonymous, memory-less
units with limited capabilities of sensing their neighborhood. Each agent is
programmed to behave according to a linear local gathering process, based on
the relative position of all its neighbors. The detected exogenous control,
which is a desired velocity vector, is added by the leaders to the local
gathering control. The graph induced by the agents adjacency is referred to as
the visibility graph. We show that for piece-wise constant system parameters
and a connected visibility graph, the swarm asymptotically aligns in each
time-interval on a line in the direction of the exogenous control signal, and
all the agents move with identical speed. These results hold for two models of
pairwise influence in the gathering process, uniform and scaled. The impact of
the influence model is mostly evident when the visibility graph is incomplete.
These results are conditioned by the preservation of the connectedness of the
visibility graph. In the second part of the report we analyze sufficient
conditions for preserving the connectedness of the visibility graph. We show
that if the visibility graph is complete then certain bounds on the control
signal suffice to preserve the completeness of the graph. However, when the
graph is incomplete, general conditions, independent of the leaders topology,
could not be found.

 <dc:description>  Collaborations and citations within scientific research grow simultaneously
and interact dynamically. Modelling the coevolution between them helps to study
many phenomena that can be approached only through combining citation and
coauthorship data. A geometric graph for the coevolution is proposed, the
mechanism of which synthetically expresses the interactive impacts of authors
and papers in a geometrical way. The model is validated against a data set of
papers published on PNAS during 2007-2015. The validation shows the ability to
reproduce a range of features observed with citation and coauthorship data
combined and separately. Particularly, in the empirical distribution of
citations per author there exist two limits, in which the distribution appears
as a generalized Poisson and a power-law respectively. Our model successfully
reproduces the shape of the distribution, and provides an explanation for how
the shape emerges via the decisions of authors. The model also captures the
empirically positive correlations between the numbers of authors' papers,
citations and collaborators.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new image instance segmentation method that
segments individual glands (instances) in colon histology images. This is a
task called instance segmentation that has recently become increasingly
important. The problem is challenging since not only do the glands need to be
segmented from the complex background, they are also required to be
individually identified. Here we leverage the idea of image-to-image prediction
in recent deep learning by building a framework that automatically exploits and
fuses complex multichannel information, regional, location and boundary
patterns in gland histology images. Our proposed system, deep multichannel
framework, alleviates heavy feature design due to the use of convolutional
neural networks and is able to meet multifarious requirement by altering
channels. Compared to methods reported in the 2015 MICCAI Gland Segmentation
Challenge and other currently prevalent methods of instance segmentation, we
observe state-of-the-art results based on a number of evaluation metrics.

 <dc:description>  Wireless network virtualization has been well recognized as a way to improve
the flexibility of wireless networks by decoupling the functionality of the
system and implementing infrastructure and spectrum as services. Recent studies
have shown that caching provides a better performance to serve the content
requests from mobile users. In this paper, we propose that \emph{caching can be
applied as a service} in mobile networks, i.e., different service providers
(SPs) cache their contents in the storages of wireless facilities that owned by
mobile network operators (MNOs). Specifically, we focus on the scenario of
\emph{small-cell networks}, where cache-enabled small-cell base stations (SBSs)
are the facilities to cache contents. To deal with the competition for storages
among multiple SPs, we design a mechanism based on multi-object auctions, where
the time-dependent feature of system parameters and the frequency of content
replacement are both taken into account. Simulation results show that our
solution leads to a satisfactory outcome.

 <dc:description>  We present a comparative study of the influence of dispersion induced phase
noise for CO-OFDM systems using Tx channel multiplexing and Rx matched filter
(analogue hardware based); and FFT multiplexing/IFFT demultiplexing techniques
(software based). An RF carrier pilot tone is used to mitigate the phase noise
influence. From the analysis, it appears that the phase noise influence for the
two OFDM implementations is very similar. The software based system provides a
method for a rigorous evaluation of the phase noise variance caused by Common
Phase Error (CPE) and Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) and this, in turns,
leads to a BER specification. Numerical results focus on a CO-OFDM system with
1GS/s QPSK channel modulation. Worst case BER results are evaluated and
compared to the BER of a QPSK system with the same capacity as the OFDM
implementation. Results are evaluated as a function of transmission distance,
and for the QPSK system the influence of equalization enhanced phase noise
(EEPN) is included. For both types of systems, the phase noise variance
increases significantly with increasing transmission distance. An important and
novel observation is that the two types of systems have very closely the same
BER as a function of transmission distance for the same capacity. For the high
capacity QPSK implementation, the increase in BER is due to EEPN, whereas for
the OFDM approach it is due to the dispersion caused walk-off of the RF pilot
tone relative to the OFDM signal channels. For a total capacity of 400 Gb/s,
the transmission distance to have the BER &lt; 10-4 is less than 277 km.

 <dc:description>  A major challenge in the training of recurrent neural networks is the
so-called vanishing or exploding gradient problem. The use of a norm-preserving
transition operator can address this issue, but parametrization is challenging.
In this work we focus on unitary operators and describe a parametrization using
the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{u}(n)$ associated with the Lie group $U(n)$ of $n
\times n$ unitary matrices. The exponential map provides a correspondence
between these spaces, and allows us to define a unitary matrix using $n^2$ real
coefficients relative to a basis of the Lie algebra. The parametrization is
closed under additive updates of these coefficients, and thus provides a simple
space in which to do gradient descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
parametrization on the problem of learning arbitrary unitary operators,
comparing to several baselines and outperforming a recently-proposed
lower-dimensional parametrization. We additionally use our parametrization to
generalize a recently-proposed unitary recurrent neural network to arbitrary
unitary matrices, using it to solve standard long-memory tasks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a comparative study in order to specify the
influence of equalization enhanced phase noise (EEPN) for pre- and
post-compensation of chromatic dispersion in high capacity and high
constellation systems. This is - to our knowledge - the first detailed study in
this area for pre-compensation systems. Our main results show that the local
oscillator phase noise determines the EEPN influence in post-compensation
implementations whereas the transmitter laser determines the EEPN in
pre-compensation implementations. As a result of significance for the
implementation of practical longer-range systems it is to be emphasized that
the use of chromatic dispersion equalization in the optical domain - e.g. by
the use of dispersion compensation fibers - eliminates the EEPN entirely. Thus,
this seems a good option for such systems operating at high constellations in
the future.

 <dc:description>  Existing techniques for motion imitation often suffer a certain level of
latency due to their computational overhead or a large set of correspondence
samples to search. To achieve real-time imitation with small latency, we
present a framework in this paper to reconstruct motion on humanoids based on
sparsely sampled correspondence. The imitation problem is formulated as finding
the projection of a point from the configuration space of a human's poses into
the configuration space of a humanoid. An optimal projection is defined as the
one that minimizes a back-projected deviation among a group of candidates,
which can be determined in a very efficient way. Benefited from this
formulation, effective projections can be obtained by using sparse
correspondence. Methods for generating these sparse correspondence samples have
also been introduced. Our method is evaluated by applying the human's motion
captured by a RGB-D sensor to a humanoid in real-time. Continuous motion can be
realized and used in the example application of tele-operation.

 <dc:description>  We present a quantitative basis-independent analysis of combinatory logic.
Using a general argument regarding plane binary trees with labelled leaves, we
generalise the results of David et al. and Bendkowski et al. to all
Turing-complete combinator bases proving, inter alia, that asymptotically
almost no combinator is strongly normalising nor typeable. We exploit the
structure of recently discovered normal-order reduction grammars showing that
for each positive $n$, the set of $\mathbf{S} \mathbf{K}$-combinators reducing
in $n$ normal-order reduction steps has positive asymptotic density in the set
of all combinators. Our approach is constructive, allowing us to systematically
find new asymptotically significant fractions of normalising combinators. We
show that the density of normalising combinators cannot be less than $34\%$,
improving the previously best lower bound of approximately $3\%$. Finally, we
present some super-computer experimental results, conjecturing that the density
of normalising combinators is close to $85\%$.

 <dc:description>  The theory of regular and aperiodic transformations of finite strings has
recently received a lot of interest. These classes can be equivalently defined
using logic (Monadic second-order logic and first-order logic), two-way
machines (regular two-way and aperiodic two-way transducers), and one-way
register machines (regular streaming string and aperiodic streaming string
transducers). These classes are known to be closed under operations such as
sequential composition and regular (star-free) choice; and problems such as
functional equivalence and type checking, are decidable for these classes. On
the other hand, for infinite strings these results are only known for
$\omega$-regular transformations: Alur, Filiot, and Trivedi studied
transformations of infinite strings and introduced an extension of streaming
string transducers over $\omega$-strings and showed that they capture monadic
second-order definable transformations for infinite strings. In this paper we
extend their work to recover connection for infinite strings among first-order
logic definable transformations, aperiodic two-way transducers, and aperiodic
streaming string transducers.

 <dc:description>  A graph $U$ is an induced universal graph for a family $F$ of graphs if every
graph in $F$ is a vertex-induced subgraph of $U$. For the family of all
undirected graphs on $n$ vertices Alstrup, Kaplan, Thorup, and Zwick [STOC
2015] give an induced universal graph with $O\!\left(2^{n/2}\right)$ vertices,
matching a lower bound by Moon [Proc. Glasgow Math. Assoc. 1965].
  Let $k= \lceil D/2 \rceil$. Improving asymptotically on previous results by
Butler [Graphs and Combinatorics 2009] and Esperet, Arnaud and Ochem [IPL
2008], we give an induced universal graph with $O\!\left(\frac{k2^k}{k!}n^k
\right)$ vertices for the family of graphs with $n$ vertices of maximum degree
$D$. For constant $D$, Butler gives a lower bound of
$\Omega\!\left(n^{D/2}\right)$. For an odd constant $D\geq 3$, Esperet et al.
and Alon and Capalbo [SODA 2008] give a graph with
$O\!\left(n^{k-\frac{1}{D}}\right)$ vertices. Using their techniques for any
(including constant) even values of $D$ gives asymptotically worse bounds than
we present.
  For large $D$, i.e. when $D = \Omega\left(\log^3 n\right)$, the previous best
upper bound was ${n\choose\lceil D/2\rceil} n^{O(1)}$ due to Adjiashvili and
Rotbart [ICALP 2014]. We give upper and lower bounds showing that the size is
${\lfloor n/2\rfloor\choose\lfloor D/2
\rfloor}2^{\pm\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{D}\right)}$. Hence the optimal size is
$2^{\tilde{O}(D)}$ and our construction is within a factor of
$2^{\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{D}\right)}$ from this. The previous results were
larger by at least a factor of $2^{\Omega(D)}$.
  As a part of the above, proving a conjecture by Esperet et al., we construct
an induced universal graph with $2n-1$ vertices for the family of graphs with
max degree $2$. In addition, we give results for acyclic graphs with max degree
$2$ and cycle graphs. Our results imply the first labeling schemes that for any
$D$ are at most $o(n)$ bits from optimal.

 <dc:title>Improved Algorithms for Maintaining DFS Tree in Undirected Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Depth first search (DFS) tree is one of the most well-known data structures
for designing efficient graph algorithms. Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$
with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the textbook algorithm takes $O(n+m)$ time to
construct a DFS tree. In this paper, we study the problem of maintaining a DFS
tree when the graph is undergoing updates. Formally, we show the following
results.
  Incremental DFS tree: Given any arbitrary online sequence of edge or vertex
insertions, we can report a DFS tree in $O(n)$ worst case time per operation,
and $O\left(\min\{m \log n + n \log^2 n, n^2\}\right)$ preprocessing time.
  Fault tolerant DFS tree: There exists a data structure of size $O(m \log n)$,
such that given any set $\mathcal{F}$ of failed vertices or edges, it can
report a DFS tree of the graph $G \setminus \mathcal{F}$ in
$O(n|\mathcal{F}|\log^2 n)$ time.
  Fully dynamic DFS tree: Given any arbitrary online sequence of edge or vertex
updates, we can report a DFS tree in $O(\sqrt{nm}\log^{1.5} n)$ worst case time
per operation.
  Our result for incremental DFS tree improves the previous $O(n \log^3 n)$
worst case update time by Baswana et al., and matches the trivial $\Omega(n)$
lower bound when it is required to explicitly output the DFS tree. Our other
results also improve the corresponding state-of-the-art results by Baswana et
al. as well. Our work builds on the framework of the breakthrough work by
Baswana et al., together with a novel use of a tree-partition lemma by Duan and
Zhang, and the celebrated fractional cascading technique by Chazelle and
Guibas.

 <dc:description>  Although artificial neural networks have shown great promise in applications
including computer vision and speech recognition, there remains considerable
practical and theoretical difficulty in optimizing their parameters. The
seemingly unreasonable success of gradient descent methods in minimizing these
non-convex functions remains poorly understood. In this work we offer some
theoretical guarantees for networks with piecewise affine activation functions,
which have in recent years become the norm. We prove three main results.
Firstly, that the network is piecewise convex as a function of the input data.
Secondly, that the network, considered as a function of the parameters in a
single layer, all others held constant, is again piecewise convex. Finally,
that the network as a function of all its parameters is piecewise multi-convex,
a generalization of biconvexity. From here we characterize the local minima and
stationary points of the training objective, showing that they minimize certain
subsets of the parameter space. We then analyze the performance of two
optimization algorithms on multi-convex problems: gradient descent, and a
method which repeatedly solves a number of convex sub-problems. We prove
necessary convergence conditions for the first algorithm and both necessary and
sufficient conditions for the second, after introducing regularization to the
objective. Finally, we remark on the remaining difficulty of the global
optimization problem. Under the squared error objective, we show that by
varying the training data, a single rectifier neuron admits local minima
arbitrarily far apart, both in objective value and parameter space.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies a data recovery problem in compressed sensing (CS), given
a measurement vector b with corruptions: b=Ax0+f0, can we recover x0 and f0 via
the reweighted l1 minimization: minimize |x| + lambda*|f| subject to Ax+f=b?
Here the m by n measurement matrix A is a partial Fourier matrix, x0 denotes
the n dimensional ground true signal vector, f0 denotes the m-dimensional
corrupted noise vector, it is assumed that a positive fraction of entries in
the measurement vector b are corrupted by the non-zero entries of f0. This
problem had been studied in literatures [1-3], unfortunately, certain random
assumptions (which are often hard to meet in practice) are required for the
signal x0 in these papers. In this paper, we show that x0 and f0 can be
recovered exactly by the solution of the above reweighted l1 minimization with
high probability provided that m&gt;O(card(x0)log(n)log(n)) and n is prime, here
card(x0) denotes the cardinality (number of non-zero entries) of x0. Except the
sparsity, no extra assumption is needed for x0.

 <dc:title>Fronthaul-Limited Uplink OFDMA in Ultra-Dense CRAN with Hybrid Decoding</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Stephen, Reuben George</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Rui</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In an ultra-dense cloud radio access network (UD-CRAN), a large number of
remote radio heads (RRHs), typically employed as simple relay nodes, are
distributed in a target area, which could even outnumber their served users.
However, one major challenge is that the large amount of information required
to be transferred between each RRH and the central processor (CP) for joint
signal processing can easily exceed the capacity of the fronthaul links
connecting them. This motivates our study in this paper on a new hybrid
decoding scheme where in addition to quantizing and forwarding the received
signals for joint decoding at the CP, i.e. forward-and-decode (FaD) as in the
conventional CRAN, the RRHs can locally decode-and-forward (DaF) the user
messages to save the fronthaul capacity. In particular, we consider the uplink
transmission in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based
UD-CRAN, where the proposed hybrid decoding is performed on each OFDMA
sub-channel (SC). We study a joint optimization of the processing mode
selections (DaF or FaD), user-SC assignments and the users' transmit power
allocations over all SCs to maximize their weighted-sum-rate subject to the
RRHs' individual fronthaul capacity constraints and the users' individual power
constraints. Although the problem is non-convex, we propose a Lagrange duality
based solution, which can be efficiently computed with good accuracy. Further,
we propose a low-complexity greedy algorithm which is shown to achieve close to
the optimal performance under practical setups. Simulation results show the
promising throughput gains of the proposed designs with hybrid decoding,
compared to the existing schemes that perform either DaF or FaD at all SCs.

 <dc:description>  With the emergence of passive and active optical sensors available for
geospatial imaging, information fusion across sensors is becoming ever more
important. An important aspect of single (or multiple) sensor geospatial image
analysis is feature extraction - the process of finding &quot;optimal&quot; lower
dimensional subspaces that adequately characterize class-specific information
for subsequent analysis tasks, such as classification, change and anomaly
detection etc. In recent work, we proposed and developed an angle-based
discriminant analysis approach that projected data onto subspaces with maximal
&quot;angular&quot; separability in the input (raw) feature space and Reproducible Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS). We also developed an angular locality preserving variant
of this algorithm. In this letter, we advance this work and make it suitable
for information fusion - we propose and validate a composite kernel local
angular discriminant analysis projection, that can operate on an ensemble of
feature sources (e.g. from different sources), and project the data onto a
unified space through composite kernels where the data are maximally separated
in an angular sense. We validate this method with the multi-sensor University
of Houston hyperspectral and LiDAR dataset, and demonstrate that the proposed
method significantly outperforms other composite kernel approaches to sensor
(information) fusion.

 <dc:description>  Locally-biased graph algorithms are algorithms that attempt to find local or
small-scale structure in a large data graph. In some cases, this can be
accomplished by adding some sort of locality constraint and calling a
traditional graph algorithm; but more interesting are locally-biased graph
algorithms that compute answers by running a procedure that does not even look
at most of the input graph. This corresponds more closely to what practitioners
from various data science domains do, but it does not correspond well with the
way that algorithmic and statistical theory is typically formulated. Recent
work from several research communities has focused on developing locally-biased
graph algorithms that come with strong complementary algorithmic and
statistical theory and that are useful in practice in downstream data science
applications. We provide a review and overview of this work, highlighting
commonalities between seemingly-different approaches, and highlighting
promising directions for future work.

 <dc:title>Sparse Representation-Based Classification: Orthogonal Least Squares or
  Orthogonal Matching Pursuit?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Spare representation of signals has received significant attention in recent
years. Based on these developments, a sparse representation-based
classification (SRC) has been proposed for a variety of classification and
related tasks, including face recognition. Recently, a class dependent variant
of SRC was proposed to overcome the limitations of SRC for remote sensing image
classification. Traditionally, greedy pursuit based method such as orthogonal
matching pursuit (OMP) are used for sparse coefficient recovery due to their
simplicity as well as low time-complexity. However, orthogonal least square
(OLS) has not yet been widely used in classifiers that exploit the sparse
representation properties of data. Since OLS produces lower signal
reconstruction error than OMP under similar conditions, we hypothesize that
more accurate signal estimation will further improve the classification
performance of classifiers that exploiting the sparsity of data. In this paper,
we present a classification method based on OLS, which implements OLS in a
classwise manner to perform the classification. We also develop and present its
kernelized variant to handle nonlinearly separable data. Based on two
real-world benchmarking hyperspectral datasets, we demonstrate that class
dependent OLS based methods outperform several baseline methods including
traditional SRC and the support vector machine classifier.

 <dc:description>  Sophisticated malware authors can sneak hidden malicious code into portable
executable files, and this code can be hard to detect, especially if encrypted
or compressed. However, when an executable file switches between code regimes
(e.g. native, encrypted, compressed, text, and padding), there are
corresponding shifts in the file's representation as an entropy signal. In this
paper, we develop a method for automatically quantifying the extent to which
patterned variations in a file's entropy signal make it &quot;suspicious.&quot; In
Experiment 1, we use wavelet transforms to define a Suspiciously Structured
Entropic Change Score (SSECS), a scalar feature that quantifies the
suspiciousness of a file based on its distribution of entropic energy across
multiple levels of spatial resolution. Based on this single feature, it was
possible to raise predictive accuracy on a malware detection task from 50.0% to
68.7%, even though the single feature was applied to a heterogeneous corpus of
malware discovered &quot;in the wild.&quot; In Experiment 2, we describe how
wavelet-based decompositions of software entropy can be applied to a parasitic
malware detection task involving large numbers of samples and features. By
extracting only string and entropy features (with wavelet decompositions) from
software samples, we are able to obtain almost 99% detection of parasitic
malware with fewer than 1% false positives on good files. Moreover, the
addition of wavelet-based features uniformly improved detection performance
across plausible false positive rates, both in a strings-only model (e.g., from
80.90% to 82.97%) and a strings-plus-entropy model (e.g. from 92.10% to 94.74%,
and from 98.63% to 98.90%). Overall, wavelet decomposition of software entropy
can be useful for machine learning models for detecting malware based on
extracting millions of features from executable files.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an adaptive control strategy with LQ control of a
quarter-car, which is ameliorated to smoothly follow the dynamically changing
reference arm angle, in order to omit the heave sensor in this study.
Linearized plant parameters are initially derived from model equation and then
estimated by online estimator. LQ control method provides optimal control
effort with corresponding estimated plant parameters. The results of the
simulation are depicted in time domain. Weighted RMS values of the consequences
are suggested to assess the efficiency of the controller. Different road

 <dc:description>  In support of applications involving multiview sources in distributed object
recognition using lightweight cameras, we propose a new method for the
distributed coding of sparse sources as visual descriptor histograms extracted
from multiview images. The problem is challenging due to the computational and
energy constraints at each camera as well as the limitations regarding
inter-camera communication. Our approach addresses these challenges by
exploiting the sparsity of the visual descriptor histograms as well as their
intra- and inter-camera correlations. Our method couples distributed source
coding of the sparse sources with a new joint recovery algorithm that
incorporates multiple side information signals, where prior knowledge (low
quality) of all the sparse sources is initially sent to exploit their
correlations. Experimental evaluation using the histograms of shift-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) descriptors extracted from multiview images shows that
our method leads to bit-rate saving of up to 43% compared to the
state-of-the-art distributed compressed sensing method with independent
encoding of the sources.

 <dc:description>  While social robots are developed to provide assistance to users through
social interactions, their behaviors are dominantly pre-programmed and
remote-controlled. Despite the numerous robot control architectures being
developed, very few offer reutilization opportunities in various therapeutic
contexts. To bridge this gap, we propose a robot control architecture to be
applied in different scenarios taking into account requirements from both
therapeutic and robotic perspectives. As robot behaviors are kept at an
abstract level and afterward mapped with the robot's morphology, the proposed
architecture accommodates its applicability to a variety of social robot
platforms.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present an approach to improve the accuracy of a strong

that are extracted from a large parsed corpus. We integrated a small number of
features based on the dependency language models into the parser. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we evaluate our parser

competitive accuracy scores. Our enhanced parser achieved state-of-the-art
accuracy on Chinese data and competitive results on English data. We gained a
large absolute improvement of one point (UAS) on Chinese and 0.5 points for
English.

 <dc:title>Distributed Graph Clustering by Load Balancing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Graph clustering is a fundamental computational problem with a number of
applications in algorithm design, machine learning, data mining, and analysis
of social networks. Over the past decades, researchers have proposed a number
of algorithmic design methods for graph clustering. However, most of these
methods are based on complicated spectral techniques or convex optimisation,
and cannot be applied directly for clustering many networks that occur in
practice, whose information is often collected on different sites. Designing a
simple and distributed clustering algorithm is of great interest, and has wide
applications for processing big datasets.
  In this paper we present a simple and distributed algorithm for graph
clustering: for a wide class of graphs that are characterised by a strong
cluster-structure, our algorithm finishes in a poly-logarithmic number of
rounds, and recovers a partition of the graph close to an optimal partition.
The main component of our algorithm is an application of the random matching
model of load balancing, which is a fundamental protocol in distributed
computing and has been extensively studied in the past 20 years. Hence, our
result highlights an intrinsic and interesting connection between graph
clustering and load balancing.
  At a technical level, we present a purely algebraic result characterising the
early behaviours of load balancing processes for graphs exhibiting a
cluster-structure. We believe that this result can be further applied to
analyse other gossip processes, such as rumour spreading and averaging
processes.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Solving geometric optimization problems over uncertain data have become
increasingly important in many applications and have attracted a lot of
attentions in recent years. In this paper, we study two important geometric
optimization problems, the $k$-center problem and the $j$-flat-center problem,
over stochastic/uncertain data points in Euclidean spaces. For the stochastic
$k$-center problem, we would like to find $k$ points in a fixed dimensional
Euclidean space, such that the expected value of the $k$-center objective is
minimized. For the stochastic $j$-flat-center problem, we seek a $j$-flat
(i.e., a $j$-dimensional affine subspace) such that the expected value of the
maximum distance from any point to the $j$-flat is minimized. We consider both
problems under two popular stochastic geometric models, the existential
uncertainty model, where the existence of each point may be uncertain, and the
locational uncertainty model, where the location of each point may be
uncertain. We provide the first PTAS (Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme) for
both problems under the two models. Our results generalize the previous results
for stochastic minimum enclosing ball and stochastic enclosing cylinder.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we analyze the failing sets of the interval-passing algorithm
(IPA) for compressed sensing. The IPA is an efficient iterative algorithm for
reconstructing a k-sparse nonnegative n-dimensional real signal x from a small
number of linear measurements y. In particular, we show that the IPA fails to
recover x from y if and only if it fails to recover a corresponding binary
vector of the same support, and also that only positions of nonzero values in
the measurement matrix are of importance for success of recovery. Based on this
observation, we introduce termatiko sets and show that the IPA fails to fully
recover x if and only if the support of x contains a nonempty termatiko set,
thus giving a complete (graph-theoretic) description of the failing sets of the
IPA. Finally, we present an extensive numerical study showing that in many
cases there exist termatiko sets of size strictly smaller than the stopping
distance of the binary measurement matrix; even as low as half the stopping
distance in some cases.

this problem from first principles and formulate it as a surprisingly simple
optimization problem. Indeed, our formulation even admits a closed form
solution. This solution possesses several very attractive properties: (i) an
innate geometric appeal through the Riemannian geometry of positive definite
matrices; (ii) ease of interpretability; and (iii) computational speed several
orders of magnitude faster than the widely used LMNN and ITML methods.
Furthermore, on standard benchmark datasets, our closed-form solution
consistently attains higher classification accuracy.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a general framework for end-to-end optimization of the
rate--distortion performance of nonlinear transform codes assuming scalar
quantization. The framework can be used to optimize any differentiable pair of
analysis and synthesis transforms in combination with any differentiable
perceptual metric. As an example, we consider a code built from a linear
transform followed by a form of multi-dimensional local gain control.
Distortion is measured with a state-of-the-art perceptual metric. When
optimized over a large database of images, this representation offers
substantial improvements in bitrate and perceptual appearance over fixed (DCT)
codes, and over linear transform codes optimized for mean squared error.

 <dc:description>  In this note the precise minimum number of key comparisons any dual-pivot
quickselect algorithm (without sampling) needs on average is determined. The
result is in the form of exact as well as asymptotic formul\ae{} of this number
of a comparison-optimal algorithm. It turns out that the main terms of these
asymptotic expansions coincide with the main terms of the corresponding
analysis of the classical quickselect, but still---as this was shown for
Yaroslavskiy quickselect---more comparisons are needed in the dual-pivot
variant. The results are obtained by solving a second order differential
equation for the generating function obtained from a recursive approach.

embeddings can be employed for the task of semantic language classification and
that joint semantic spaces vary in meaningful ways across second languages. Our
results support the hypothesis that semantic language similarity is influenced
by both structural similarity as well as geography/contact.

 <dc:description>  Reliable prediction of system status is a highly demanded functionality of
smart energy systems, which can enable users or human operators to react
quickly to potential future system changes. By adopting the multi-timescale
nexting method, we develop an architecture of human-in-the-loop energy control
system, which is capable of casting short-term predictive information about the
specific smart energy system. The developed architecture does either require a
system model nor additional acquisition of (sensor) data in the existing system
configuration. Our first experiments demonstrate the performance of the
proposed control architecture in an electrical heating system simulation. In
the second experiment, we verify the effectiveness of our developed structure
in simulating a heating system in a thermal model of a building, by employing
natural EnergyPlus temperature data.

 <dc:description>  Rateless Multiple Access (RMA) is a novel non-orthogonal multiple access
framework that is promising for massive access in Internet of Things (IoT) due
to its high efficiency and low complexity. In the framework, after certain
\emph{registration}, each active user respectively transmits to the access
point (AP) randomly based on an assigned random access control function (RACf)
until receiving an acknowledgement (ACK). In this work, by exploiting the
intrinsic access pattern of each user, we propose a grant-free RMA scheme,
which no longer needs the registration process as in the original RMA, thus
greatly reduces the signalling overhead and system latency. Furthermore, we
propose a low-complexity joint iterative detection and decoding algorithm in
which the channel estimation, active user detection, and information decoding
are done simultaneously. Finally, we propose a method based on density
evolution (DE) to evaluate the system performance.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Substitution boxes with thorough cryptographic strengths are essential for
the development of strong encryption systems. They are the only portions
capable of inducing nonlinearity in symmetric encryption systems. Bijective
substitution boxes having both high nonlinearities and high algebraic
complexities are the most desirable to thwart linear, differential and
algebraic attacks. In this paper, a method of constructing algebraically
complex and cryptographically potent multiple substitution boxes is proposed.
The multiple substitution boxes are synthesized by applying the concept of
rotation-k approach on the affine-power-affine structure. It is shown that the
rotation-k approach inherits all the features of affine-power-affine structure.
Performance assessment of all the proposed substitution boxes is done against
nonlinearity, strict avalanche criteria, bits independent criteria,
differential probability, linear approximation probability and algebraic
complexity. It has been found that the proposed substitution boxes have
outstanding cryptographic characteristics and outperform the various recent
substitution boxes.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Artificial Intelligence in Games: Issues, Requirements, and a
  Solution through Behavlets-based General Player Modelling</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cowley, Benjamin Ultan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Charles, Darryl</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present the last of a series of three academic essays which deal with the
question of how and why to build a generalized player model. We propose that a
general player model needs parameters for subjective experience of play,
including: player psychology, game structure, and actions of play. Based on
this proposition, we pose three linked research questions: RQ1 what is a
necessary and sufficient foundation to a general player model?; RQ2 can such a
foundation improve performance of a computational intelligence- based player
model?; and RQ3 can such a player model improve efficacy of adaptive artificial
intelligence in games?
  We set out the arguments behind these research questions in each of the three
essays, presented as three preprints. The third essay, in this preprint,
presents the argument that adaptive game artificial intelligence will be
enhanced by a generalised player model. This is because games are inherently
human artefacts which therefore, require some encoding of the human perspective
in order to effectively autonomously respond to the individual player. The
player model informs the necessary constraints on the adaptive artificial
intelligence. A generalised player model is not only more efficient than a
per-game solution, but also allows comparison between games which makes it a
useful tool for studying play in general. We describe the concept and meaning
of an adaptive game. We propose requirements for functional adaptive AI,
arguing from first principles drawn from the games research literature. We
propose solutions to these requirements, based on a formal model approach to
our existing 'Behavlets' method for psychologically-derived player modelling:

Modelling using Psychology-Based Player Traits and Domain Specific Features.

 <dc:title>Big data challenges for the social sciences: from society and opinion to

 <dc:creator>Boullier, Dominique</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Big Data dealing with the social produce predictive correlations for the
benefit of brands and web platforms. Beyond &quot;society&quot; and &quot;opinion&quot; for which
the text lays out a genealogy, appear the &quot;traces&quot; that must be theorized as
&quot;replications&quot; by the social sciences in order to reap the benefits of the
uncertain status of entities' widespread traceability. High frequency
replications as a collective phenomenon did exist before the digital networks
emergence but now they leave traces that can be computed. The third generation
of Social Sciences currently emerging must assume the specific nature of the
world of data created by digital networks, without reducing them to the
categories of the sciences of &quot;society&quot; or &quot;opinion&quot;. Examples from recent
works on Twitter and other digital corpora show how the search for structural
effects or market-style trade-offs are prevalent even though insights about
propagation, virality and memetics could help build a new theoretical
framework.

 <dc:title>A Markov Chain Model for the Decoding Probability of Sparse Network

 <dc:description>  Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) has been proved to offer an efficient
communication scheme, leveraging an interesting robustness against packet
losses. However, it suffers from a high computational complexity and some novel
approaches, which follow the same idea, have been recently proposed. One of
such solutions is Tunable Sparse Network Coding (TSNC), where only few packets
are combined in each transmissions. The amount of data packets to be combined
in each transmissions can be set from a density parameter/distribution, which
could be eventually adapted. In this work we present an analytical model that
captures the performance of SNC on an accurate way. We exploit an absorbing
Markov process where the states are defined by the number of useful packets
received by the decoder, i.e the decoding matrix rank, and the number of
non-zero columns at such matrix. The model is validated by means of a thorough
simulation campaign, and the difference between model and simulation is
negligible. A mean square error less than $4 \cdot 10^{-4}$ in the worst cases.
We also include in the comparison some of more general bounds that have been
recently used, showing that their accuracy is rather poor. The proposed model
would enable a more precise assessment of the behavior of sparse network coding
techniques. The last results show that the proposed analytical model can be
exploited by the TSNC techniques in order to select by the encoder the best
density as the transmission evolves.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel framework for hallucinating faces of unconstrained poses
and with very low resolution (face size as small as 5pxIOD). In contrast to
existing studies that mostly ignore or assume pre-aligned face spatial
configuration (e.g. facial landmarks localization or dense correspondence
field), we alternatingly optimize two complementary tasks, namely face
hallucination and dense correspondence field estimation, in a unified
framework. In addition, we propose a new gated deep bi-network that contains
two functionality-specialized branches to recover different levels of texture
details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that such formulation allows
exceptional hallucination quality on in-the-wild low-res faces with significant
pose and illumination variations.

 <dc:description>  We consider the positioning problem of aerial drone systems for efficient
three-dimensional (3-D) coverage. Our solution draws from molecular geometry,
where forces among electron pairs surrounding a central atom arrange their
positions. In this paper, we propose a 3-D clustering algorithm for autonomous
positioning (VBCA) of aerial drone networks based on virtual forces. These
virtual forces induce interactions among drones and structure the system
topology. The advantages of our approach are that (1) virtual forces enable
drones to self-organize the positioning process and (2) VBCA can be implemented
entirely localized. Extensive simulations show that our virtual forces
clustering approach produces scalable 3-D topologies exhibiting near-optimal
volume coverage. VBCA triggers efficient topology rearrangement for an altering
number of nodes, while providing network connectivity to the central drone. We
also draw a comparison of volume coverage achieved by VBCA against existing
approaches and find VBCA up to 40\% more efficient.

 <dc:description>  We give new bounds on the reliability function of a typewriter channel with 5
inputs and crossover probability $1/2$. The lower bound is more of theoretical
than practical importance; it improves very marginally the expurgated bound,
providing a counterexample to a conjecture on its tightness by Shannon,
Gallager and Berlekamp which does not need the construction of
algebraic-geometric codes previously used by Katsman, Tsfasman and
Vl\u{a}du\c{t}. The upper bound is derived by using an adaptation of the linear
programming bound and it is essentially useful as a low-rate anchor for the
straight line bound.

 <dc:description>  The present manuscript deals with the realization of Processing In-memory
(PIM) computing architecture using Quantum Dot Cellular Automata (QCA) and
Akers array. The PIM computing architecture becomes popular due to its
effective framework for storage and computation of data in a single unit. Here,
we illustrate two input NAND and NOR gate with the help of QCA based Akers
Array as a case study. The QCA flip-flop is used as a primitive cell to design
PIM architecture. The results suggested that both the gate have minimum power
dissipation. The polarization results of proposed architecture suggested that
the signals are in good control. The foot print of the primitive cell equals to
0.04 micron^2, which is smaller than conventional CMOS primitive cell. The
combination of QCA and Akers array provides many additional benefits over the
conventional architecture like reduction in the power consumption and feature
size, furthermore, it also improves the computational speed.

 <dc:description>  Aiming at improving the performance of existing detection algorithms
developed for different applications, we propose a region regression-based
multi-stage class-agnostic detection pipeline, whereby the existing algorithms
are employed for providing the initial detection proposals. Better detection is
obtained by exploiting the power of deep learning in the region regress scheme
while avoiding the requirement on a huge amount of reference data for training
deep neural networks. Additionally, a novel network architecture with recycled
deep features is proposed, which provides superior regression results compared
to the commonly used architectures. As demonstrated on a data set with ~1200
samples of different classes, it is feasible to successfully train a deep
neural network in our proposed architecture and use it to obtain the desired
detection performance. Since only slight modifications are required to common
network architectures and since the deep neural network is trained using the
standard hyperparameters, the proposed detection is well accessible and can be
easily adopted to a broad variety of detection tasks.

 <dc:title>Algorithmic Trading: A brief, computational finance case study on data
  centre FPGAs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Inggs, Gordon</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Increasingly FPGAs will be deployed at scale due to the need for increased
need for power efficient computation and improved high level synthesis tool
flows, creating a new category of device: data centre FPGAs. A method for using
these FPGAs is to identify what proportion of a given workload would benefit
from being implemented upon the available FPGAs while minimising communication
off-chip. As part of the implementation of these tasks, care should be taken in
identifying the parallel execution mode, task or pipeline parallelism that
should be used. When considering a case study of computational finance tasks, a
benchmark workload of Heston and Black-Scholes-based options implemented using
OpenCL and OpenSPL, the benefit of this method of using data centre FPGAs is
illustrated. These devices deliver latency performance close to that of
workstation grade GPUs, while requiring considerably less energy, resulting in
30% more floating point operations per Joule of energy consumed.

 <dc:description>  The growing use of neuroimaging technologies generates a massive amount of
biomedical data that exhibit high dimensionality. Tensor-based analysis of
brain imaging data has been proved quite effective in exploiting their multiway
nature. The advantages of tensorial methods over matrix-based approaches have
also been demonstrated in the characterization of functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) data, where the spatial (voxel) dimensions are commonly grouped
(unfolded) as a single way/mode of the 3-rd order array, the other two ways
corresponding to time and subjects. However, such methods are known to be
ineffective in more demanding scenarios, such as the ones with strong noise
and/or significant overlapping of activated regions. This paper aims at
investigating the possible gains from a better exploitation of the spatial
dimension, through a higher- (4 or 5) order tensor modeling of the fMRI signal.
In this context, and in order to increase the degrees of freedom of the
modeling process, a higher-order Block Term Decomposition (BTD) is applied, for
the first time in fMRI analysis. Its effectiveness is demonstrated via
extensive simulation results.

 <dc:description>  We propose a method for interactive boundary extraction which combines a
deep, patch-based representation with an active contour framework. We train a
class-specific convolutional neural network which predicts a vector pointing
from the respective point on the evolving contour towards the closest point on
the boundary of the object of interest. These predictions form a vector field
which is then used for evolving the contour by the Sobolev active contour
framework proposed by Sundaramoorthi et al. The resulting interactive
segmentation method is very efficient in terms of required computational
resources and can even be trained on comparatively small graphics cards. We
evaluate the potential of the proposed method on both medical and non-medical
challenge data sets, such as the STACOM data set and the PASCAL VOC 2012 data
set.

 <dc:description>  The performance of long-haul coherent optical fiber transmission system is
significantly affected by the equalization enhanced phase noise (EEPN), due to
the interaction between the electronic dispersion compensation (EDC) and the
laser phase noise. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on different
chromatic dispersion (CD) compensation and carrier phase recovery (CPR)
approaches, in the n-level phase shift keying (n-PSK) and the n-level
quadrature amplitude modulation (n-QAM) coherent optical transmission systems,
considering the impacts of EEPN. Four CD compensation methods are considered:
the time-domain equalization (TDE), the frequency-domain equalization (FDE),
the least mean square (LMS) adaptive equalization are applied for EDC, and the
dispersion compensating fiber (DCF) is employed for optical dispersion
compensation (ODC). Meanwhile, three carrier phase recovery methods are also
involved: a one-tap normalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm, a block-wise
average (BWA) algorithm, and a Viterbi-Viterbi (VV) algorithm. Numerical
simulations have been carried out in a 28-Gbaud dual-polarization quadrature
phase shift keying (DP-QPSK) coherent transmission system, and the results
indicate that the origin of EEPN depends on the choice of chromatic dispersion
compensation methods, and the effects of EEPN also behave moderately different
in accordance to different carrier phase recovery scenarios.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel method for learning how to play the most
difficult Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment using deep
reinforcement learning. The proposed method, human checkpoint replay, consists
in using checkpoints sampled from human gameplay as starting points for the
learning process. This is meant to compensate for the difficulties of current
exploration strategies, such as epsilon-greedy, to find successful control
policies in games with sparse rewards. Like other deep reinforcement learning
architectures, our model uses a convolutional neural network that receives only
raw pixel inputs to estimate the state value function. We tested our method on
Montezuma's Revenge and Private Eye, two of the most challenging games from the
Atari platform. The results we obtained show a substantial improvement compared
to previous learning approaches, as well as over a random player. We also
propose a method for training deep reinforcement learning agents using human
gameplay experience, which we call human experience replay.

 <dc:title>Towards Personality-Aware Recommendation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Roffo, Giorgio</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the last decade new ways of shopping online have increased the possibility
of buying products and services more easily and faster than ever. In this new
context, personality is a key determinant in the decision making of the
consumer when shopping. The two main reasons are: firstly, a person's buying
choices are influenced by psychological factors like impulsiveness, and
secondly, some consumers may be more susceptible to making impulse purchases
than others. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of personality factors on
advertisements has been largely neglected at the level of recommender systems.
This work proposes a highly innovative research which uses a personality
perspective to determine the unique associations among the consumer's buying
tendency and advert recommendations. As a matter of fact, the lack of a
publicly available benchmark for computational advertising do not allow both
the exploration of this intriguing research direction and the evaluation of
state-of-the-art algorithms. We present the ADS Dataset, a publicly available
benchmark for computational advertising enriched with Big-Five users'
personality factors and 1,200 personal users' pictures. The proposed benchmark
allows two main tasks: rating prediction over 300 real advertisements (i.e.,
Rich Media Ads, Image Ads, Text Ads) and click-through rate prediction.
Moreover, this work carries out experiments, reviews various evaluation
criteria used in the literature, and provides a library for each one of them
within one integrated toolbox.

 <dc:description>  Two-dimensional (2D) pressure field estimation in molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations has been done using three-dimensional (3D) pressure field
calculations followed by averaging, which is computationally expensive due to
3D convolutions. In this work, we develop a direct 2D pressure field estimation
method which is much faster than 3D methods without losing accuracy. The method
is validated with MD simulations on two systems: a liquid film and a
cylindrical drop of argon suspended in surrounding vapor.

words will be attended to in the future. We improve upon the attention model of
Bahdanau et al. (2014) by explicitly modeling the relationship between previous
and subsequent attention levels for each word using one recurrent network per
input word. This architecture easily captures informative features, such as
fertility and regularities in relative distortion. In experiments, we show our
parameterization of attention improves translation quality.

 <dc:description>  We study the problems of finding a minimum cycle basis (a minimum weight set
of cycles that form a basis for the cycle space) and a minimum homology basis
(a minimum weight set of cycles that generates the $1$-dimensional
($\mathbb{Z}_2$)-homology classes) of an undirected graph embedded on a
surface. The problems are closely related, because the minimum cycle basis of a
graph contains its minimum homology basis, and the minimum homology basis of
the $1$-skeleton of any graph is exactly its minimum cycle basis.
  For the minimum cycle basis problem, we give a deterministic
$O(n^\omega+2^{2g}n^2+m)$-time algorithm for graphs embedded on an orientable
surface of genus $g$. The best known existing algorithms for surface embedded
graphs are those for general graphs: an $O(m^\omega)$ time Monte Carlo
algorithm and a deterministic $O(nm^2/\log n + n^2 m)$ time algorithm. For the
minimum homology basis problem, we give a deterministic $O((g+b)^3 n \log n +
m)$-time algorithm for graphs embedded on an orientable or non-orientable
surface of genus $g$ with $b$ boundary components, assuming shortest paths are
unique, improving on existing algorithms for many values of $g$ and $n$. The
assumption of unique shortest paths can be avoided with high probability using
randomization or deterministically by increasing the running time of the
homology basis algorithm by a factor of $O(\log n)$.

 <dc:description>  Propositional G\&quot;odel logic extends intuitionistic logic with the
non-constructive principle of linearity $A\rightarrow B\ \lor\ B\rightarrow A$.
We introduce a Curry-Howard correspondence for this logic and show that a
particularly simple natural deduction calculus can be used as a typing system.
The resulting functional language enriches the simply typed lambda calculus
with a synchronous communication mechanism between parallel processes. Our
normalization proof employs original termination arguments and sophisticated
proof transformations with a meaningful computational reading. Our results
provide a computational interpretation of G\&quot;odel logic as a logic of

 <dc:title>Partitioning a Graph into Small Pieces with Applications to Path
  Transversal</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lee, Euiwoong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a graph $G = (V, E)$ and an integer $k$, we study $k$-Vertex Seperator
(resp. $k$-Edge Separator), where the goal is to remove the minimum number of
vertices (resp. edges) such that each connected component in the resulting
graph has at most $k$ vertices. Our primary focus is on the case where $k$ is
either a constant or a slowly growing function of $n$ (e.g. $O(\log n)$ or
$n^{o(1)}$). Our problems can be interpreted as a special case of three general
classes of problems that have been studied separately (balanced graph
partitioning, Hypergraph Vertex Cover (HVC), and fixed parameter tractability
(FPT)).
  Our main result is an $O(\log k)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-Vertex
Seperator that runs in time $2^{O(k)} n^{O(1)}$, and an $O(\log
k)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-Edge Separator that runs in time
$n^{O(1)}$. Our result on $k$-Edge Seperator improves the best previous graph
partitioning algorithm for small $k$. Our result on $k$-Vertex Seperator
improves the simple $(k+1)$-approximation from HVC. When $OPT &gt; k$, the running
time $2^{O(k)} n^{O(1)}$ is faster than the lower bound $k^{\Omega(OPT)}
n^{\Omega(1)}$ for exact algorithms assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis.
While the running time of $2^{O(k)} n^{O(1)}$ for $k$-Vertex Separator seems
unsatisfactory, we show that the superpolynomial dependence on $k$ may be
needed to achieve a polylogarithmic approximation ratio, based on hardness of
Densest $k$-Subgraph.
  We also study $k$-Path Transversal, where the goal is to remove the minimum
number of vertices such that there is no simple path of length $k$. With
additional ideas from FPT algorithms and graph theory, we present an $O(\log
k)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-Path Transversal that runs in time
$2^{O(k^3 \log k)} n^{O(1)}$. Previously, the existence of even $(1 -
\delta)k$-approximation algorithm for fixed $\delta &gt; 0$ was open.

 <dc:description>  We present a method for solving the shortest transshipmen} problem - also
known as uncapacitated minimum cost flow - up to a multiplicative error of $ 1
+ \epsilon $ in undirected graphs with polynomially bounded integer edge
weights using a tailored gradient descent algorithm. An important special case
of the transshipment problem is the single-source shortest paths (SSSP)
problem. Our gradient descent algorithm takes $ \epsilon^{-3} polylog{n} $
iterations, and in each iteration it needs to solve the transshipment problem
up to a multiplicative error of $ polylog n $, where $ n $ is the number of
nodes. In particular, this allows us to perform a single iteration by computing
a solution on a sparse spanner of logarithmic stretch. As a consequence, we
improve prior work by obtaining the following results: (1) Broadcast congest
model: $ (1 + \epsilon) $-approximate SSSP using $ \tilde{O}
(\epsilon^{-O(1)}(\sqrt{n} + D)) $ rounds, where $ D $ is the (hop) diameter of
the network. (2) Broadcast congested clique model: $ (1 + \epsilon)
$-approximate transshipment and SSSP using $ \tilde{O} (\epsilon^{-O(1)}) $
rounds. (3) Multipass streaming model: $ (1 + \epsilon) $-approximate
transshipment and SSSP using $ \tilde{O} (n) $ space and $ \tilde{O}
(\epsilon^{-O(1)}) $ passes. The previously fastest algorithms for these models
leverage sparse hop sets. We bypass the hop set construction; computing a
spanner is sufficient with our method. The above bounds assume non-negative
integer edge weights that are polynomially bounded in $ n $; for general
non-negative weights, running times scale with the logarithm of the maximum
ratio between non-zero weights. In case of asymmetric costs, running times
scale with the maximum ratio between the costs of both directions over all
edges.

 <dc:description>  By employing the lens antenna array, beamspace MIMO can utilize beam
selection to reduce the number of required RF chains in mmWave massive MIMO
systems without obvious performance loss. However, to achieve the
capacityapproaching performance, beam selection requires the accurate
information of beamspace channel of large size, which is challenging,
especially when the number of RF chains is limited. To solve this problem, in
this paper we propose a reliable support detection (SD)-based channel
estimation scheme. Specifically, we propose to decompose the total beamspace
channel estimation problem into a series of sub-problems, each of which only
considers one sparse channel component. For each channel component, we first
reliably detect its support by utilizing the structural characteristics of
mmWave beamspace channel. Then, the influence of this channel component is
removed from the total beamspace channel estimation problem. After the supports
of all channel components have been detected, the nonzero elements of the
sparse beamspace channel can be estimated with low pilot overhead. Simulation
results show that the proposed SD-based channel estimation outperforms
conventional schemes and enjoys satisfying accuracy, even in the low SNR
region.

 <dc:title>Fully dynamic all-pairs shortest paths with worst-case update-time

 <dc:description>  We revisit the classic problem of dynamically maintaining shortest paths
between all pairs of nodes of a directed weighted graph. The allowed updates
are insertions and deletions of nodes and their incident edges. We give
worst-case guarantees on the time needed to process a single update (in
contrast to related results, the update time is not amortized over a sequence
of updates).
  Our main result is a simple randomized algorithm that for any parameter $c&gt;1$
has a worst-case update time of $O(cn^{2+2/3} \log^{4/3}{n})$ and answers
distance queries correctly with probability $1-1/n^c$, against an adaptive
online adversary if the graph contains no negative cycle. The best
deterministic algorithm is by Thorup [STOC 2005] with a worst-case update time
of $\tilde O(n^{2+3/4})$ and assumes non-negative weights. This is the first
improvement for this problem for more than a decade. Conceptually, our
algorithm shows that randomization along with a more direct approach can
provide better bounds.

 <dc:title>Improved Hardness for Cut, Interdiction, and Firefighter Problems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lee, Euiwoong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study variants of the classic $s$-$t$ cut problem and prove the following
improved hardness results assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC).
  - For any constant $k \geq 2$ and $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we show that Directed
Multicut with $k$ source-sink pairs is hard to approximate within a factor $k -
\epsilon$. This matches the trivial $k$-approximation algorithm. By a simple
reduction, our result for $k = 2$ implies that Directed Multiway Cut with two
terminals (also known as $s$-$t$ Bicut) is hard to approximate within a factor
$2 - \epsilon$, matching the trivial $2$-approximation algorithm. Previously,
the best hardness factor for these problems (for constant $k$) was $1.5 -
\epsilon$ under the UGC.
  - For Length-Bounded Cut and Shortest Path Interdiction, we show that both
problems are hard to approximate within any constant factor, even if we allow
bicriteria approximation. If we want to cut vertices or the graph is directed,
our hardness factor for Length-Bounded Cut matches the best approximation ratio
up to a constant. Previously, the best hardness factor was $1.1377$ for
Length-Bounded Cut and $2$ for Shortest Path Interdiction.
  - Assuming a variant of the UGC (implied by another variant of Bansal and
Khot), we prove that it is hard to approximate Resource Minimization Fire
Containment within any constant factor. Previously, the best hardness factor
was $2$.
  Our results are based on a general method of converting an integrality gap
instance to a length-control dictatorship test for variants of the $s$-$t$ cut
problem, which may be useful for other problems.

 <dc:description>  In a seminal paper, McAfee (1992) presented the first dominant strategy
truthful mechanism for double auction. His mechanism attains nearly optimal
gain-from-trade when the market is sufficiently large. However, his mechanism
may leave money on the table, since the price paid by the buyers may be higher
than the price paid to the sellers. This money is included in the
gain-from-trade and in some cases it accounts for almost all the
gain-from-trade, leaving almost no gain-from-trade to the traders. We present
SBBA: a variant of McAfee's mechanism which is strongly budget-balanced. There
is a single price, all money is exchanged between buyers and sellers and no
money is left on the table. This means that all gain-from-trade is enjoyed by
the traders. We generalize this variant to spatially-distributed markets with
transit costs.

 <dc:description>  This work proposes deep network models and learning algorithms for
unsupervised and supervised binary hashing. Our novel network design constrains
one hidden layer to directly output the binary codes. This addresses a
challenging issue in some previous works: optimizing non-smooth objective
functions due to binarization. Moreover, we incorporate independence and
balance properties in the direct and strict forms in the learning. Furthermore,
we include similarity preserving property in our objective function. Our
resulting optimization with these binary, independence, and balance constraints
is difficult to solve. We propose to attack it with alternating optimization
and careful relaxation. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show
that our proposed methods compare favorably with the state of the art.

 <dc:description>  Clustering web documents has numerous applications, such as aggregating news
articles into meaningful events, detecting trends and hot topics on the Web,
preserving diversity in search results, etc. At the same time, the importance
of named entities and, in particular, the ability to recognize them and to
solve the associated co-reference resolution problem are widely recognized as
key enabling factors when mining, aggregating and comparing content on the Web.
  Instead of considering these two problems separately, we propose in this
paper a method that tackles jointly the problem of clustering news articles
into events and cross-document co-reference resolution of named entities. The
co-occurrence of named entities in the same clusters is used as an additional
signal to decide whether two referents should be merged into one entity. These
refined entities can in turn be used as enhanced features to re-cluster the
documents and then be refined again, entering into a virtuous cycle that
improves simultaneously the performances of both tasks. We implemented a
prototype system and report results using the TDT5 collection of news articles,
demonstrating the potential of our approach.

 <dc:description>  Characterization of the correlations of a multiparticle system remains an
open problem. We generalize the notion of quantum discord, using multivariate
mutual information, to characterize the quantum properties of a multiparticle
system. This new measure, called dissension, is a set of numbers -- quantumness
vector. There are a number of different possible generalizations. We consider
two of them. The Track-I generalization is discord type, while the Track-II
generalization is based on all possible measurements. We give expressions for
these generalizations for n-qubit systems, and explore some of their
properties. We also consider a set of three-qubit and four-qubit states to
illustrate the usefulness of the dissension vector.

 <dc:description>  Software-defined networking (SDN) allows operators to control the behavior of
a network by programatically managing the forwarding rules installed on
switches. However, as is common in distributed systems, it can be difficult to
ensure that certain consistency properties are preserved during periods of
reconfiguration. The widely-accepted notion of PER-PACKET CONSISTENCY requires
every packet to be forwarded using the new configuration or the old
configuration, but not a mixture of the two. If switches can be updated in some
(partial) order which guarantees that per-packet consistency is preserved, we
call this order a CONSISTENT ORDER UPDATE. In particular, switches that are
incomparable in this order can be updated in parallel. We call a consistent
order update OPTIMAL if it allows maximal parallelism. This paper presents a
polynomial-time algorithm for finding an optimal consistent order update. This
contrasts with other recent results in the literature, which show that for
other classes of properties (e.g., loop-freedom and waypoint enforcement), the
optimal update problem is NP-complete.

 <dc:description>  Exploring data requires a fast feedback loop from the analyst to the system,
with a latency below about 10 seconds because of human cognitive limitations.
When data becomes large or analysis becomes complex, sequential computations
can no longer be completed in a few seconds and data exploration is severely
hampered. This article describes a novel computation paradigm called
Progressive Computation for Data Analysis or more concisely Progressive
Analytics, that brings at the programming language level a low-latency
guarantee by performing computations in a progressive fashion. Moving this
progressive computation at the language level relieves the programmer of
exploratory data analysis systems from implementing the whole analytics
pipeline in a progressive way from scratch, streamlining the implementation of
scalable exploratory data analysis systems. This article describes the new
paradigm through a prototype implementation called ProgressiVis, and explains
the requirements it implies through examples.

 <dc:title>Towards a Universal Approach for Monotonic Searchability in
  Self-Stabilizing Overlay Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Scheideler, Christian</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  For overlay networks, the ability to recover from a variety of problems like
membership changes or faults is a key element to preserve their functionality.
In recent years, various self-stabilizing overlay networks have been proposed
that have the advantage of being able to recover from any illegal state.
However, the vast majority of these networks cannot give any guarantees on its
functionality while the recovery process is going on. We are especially
interested in searchability, i.e., the functionality that search messages for a
specific identifier are answered successfully if a node with that identifier
exists in the network. We investigate overlay networks that are not only
self-stabilizing but that also ensure that monotonic searchability is
maintained while the recovery process is going on, as long as there are no
corrupted messages in the system. More precisely, once a search message from
node $u$ to another node $v$ is successfully delivered, all future search
messages from $u$ to $v$ succeed as well. Monotonic searchability was recently
introduced in OPODIS 2015, in which the authors provide a solution for a simple
line topology.
  We present the first universal approach to maintain monotonic searchability
that is applicable to a wide range of topologies. As the base for our approach,
we introduce a set of primitives for manipulating overlay networks that allows
us to maintain searchability and show how existing protocols can be transformed
to use theses primitives.
  We complement this result with a generic search protocol that together with
the use of our primitives guarantees monotonic searchability.
  As an additional feature, searching existing nodes with the generic search
protocol is as fast as searching a node with any other fixed routing protocol
once the topology has stabilized.

 <dc:title>LTE security, protocol exploits and location tracking experimentation
  with low-cost software radio</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jover, Roger Piqueras</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the latest mobile standard being implemented
globally to provide connectivity and access to advanced services for personal
mobile devices. Moreover, LTE networks are considered to be one of the main
pillars for the deployment of Machine to Machine (M2M) communication systems
and the spread of the Internet of Things (IoT). As an enabler for advanced
communications services with a subscription count in the billions, security is
of capital importance in LTE. Although legacy GSM (Global System for Mobile
Communications) networks are known for being insecure and vulnerable to rogue
base stations, LTE is assumed to guarantee confidentiality and strong
authentication. However, LTE networks are vulnerable to security threats that
tamper availability, privacy and authentication. This manuscript, which
summarizes and expands the results presented by the author at ShmooCon 2016
\cite{jover2016lte}, investigates the insecurity rationale behind LTE protocol
exploits and LTE rogue base stations based on the analysis of real LTE radio
link captures from the production network. Implementation results are discussed
from the actual deployment of LTE rogue base stations, IMSI catchers and
exploits that can potentially block a mobile device. A previously unknown
technique to potentially track the location of mobile devices as they move from
cell to cell is also discussed, with mitigations being proposed.

 <dc:title>An empirical study on the impact of IDE tool support in pair and solo
  programming</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>G&#xf3;mez, Omar S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Agile software development has been widespread adopted. One well-known agile
approach is eXtreme Programming (XP) where pair programming (PP) is a relevant
practice. Although various aspects of PP have been studied, we have not found,
under a traditional model of PP, studies that examine the impact of using an
IDE tool support. In an attempt to obtain a better understanding of the impact
of using an IDE, we present the results of a controlled experiment that expose
the influence on quality, measured as the number of defects injected per hour,
and cost, measured as the time necessary to complete programming assignments,
of pair and solo programming with and without the use of an IDE. For quality,
our findings suggest that the use of an IDE results in significantly higher
defect injection rates (for both pairs and solos) when the programming
assignment is not very complicated. Nevertheless, defect injection rates seem
to decrease when pairs work on more complicated programming assignments
irrespective of the tool support used. For cost, the programming assignment
significantly affects the time necessary to complete the assignment. Finally,
both aspects (quality and cost) are affected in a similar manner when either
pair or solo programming is used.

 <dc:title>Is spoken language all-or-nothing? Implications for future speech-based

 <dc:description>  Recent years have seen significant market penetration for voice-based
personal assistants such as Apple's Siri. However, despite this success, user
take-up is frustratingly low. This position paper argues that there is a
habitability gap caused by the inevitable mismatch between the capabilities and
expectations of human users and the features and benefits provided by
contemporary technology. Suggestions are made as to how such problems might be
mitigated, but a more worrisome question emerges: &quot;is spoken language
all-or-nothing&quot;? The answer, based on contemporary views on the special nature
of (spoken) language, is that there may indeed be a fundamental limit to the
interaction that can take place between mismatched interlocutors (such as
humans and machines). However, it is concluded that interactions between native
and non-native speakers, or between adults and children, or even between humans
and dogs, might provide critical inspiration for the design of future
speech-based human-machine interaction.

 <dc:description>  Video data is explosively growing. As a result of the &quot;big video data&quot;,
intelligent algorithms for automatic video summarization have re-emerged as a
pressing need. We develop a probabilistic model, Sequential and Hierarchical
Determinantal Point Process (SH-DPP), for query-focused extractive video
summarization. Given a user query and a long video sequence, our algorithm
returns a summary by selecting key shots from the video. The decision to
include a shot in the summary depends on the shot's relevance to the user query
and importance in the context of the video, jointly. We verify our approach on
two densely annotated video datasets. The query-focused video summarization is
particularly useful for search engines, e.g., to display snippets of videos.

 <dc:title>Towards Designing Cost-Optimal Policies to Utilize IaaS Clouds under

 <dc:description>  Cloud vendors such as Amazon EC2 offer two types of purchase options:
on-demand and spot instances. An important problem for all users is to
determine the way of utilizing different purchase options so as to minimize the
cost of processing all incoming jobs while respecting their response-time
targets. To be cost-optimal, the process under which users utilize self-owned
and cloud instances to process each job (e.g., the order of utilizing them,
when to update the allocation of them) is defined in advance by the ways that
users are charged, and, to configure the process, we need to determine the
optimal amounts of various instances at each allocation update of a job.
  In this paper, we uncover what parameters are dominating the minimum cost of
utilizing various instances and propose (near-)optimal functions of parameters
to determine the amounts of different instances allocated to a job. Although
these parameters are unknown due to the cloud market dynamics, we can apply the
technique of online learning to learn them. Compared with some existing or
intuitive policies to utilize self-owned and cloud instances, simulations are
done to show a cost reduction by up to 62.85% when spot and on-demand instances
are considered and by up to 44.00% when self-owned instances are considered.

 <dc:description>  Active network measurements constitute an impor- tant part in gaining a
better understanding of the Internet. Although IPv4-wide scans are now easily
possible, random active probing is infeasible in the IPv6 Internet. Therefore,
we propose a hybrid approach to generate a hitlist of IPv6 addresses for
scanning: First, we extract IPv6 addresses from passive flow data. Second, we
leverage publicly available resources such as rDNS data to gather further IPv6
addresses. Third, we conduct traceroute measurements from several vantage
points to obtain additional addresses. We perform multiple active measurements
on gathered IPv6 addresses and evaluate response rates over time. We
extensively compare all IPv6 address sources. In total we found 150M unique
IPv6 addresses over the course of four weeks. Our hitlist covers 72% of
announced prefixes and 84% of Autonomous Systems. Finally, we give concrete
recommendations to maximize source efficiency for different scan types.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new fast switching hybrid frequency synthesizer with
wide locking range. The hybrid synthesizer is based on the tanlock loop with no
delay block (NDTL) and is capable of integer as well as fractional frequency
division. The system maintains the in-lock state following the division process
using an efficient adaptation mechanism. The fast switching and acquisition as
well as the wide locking range and the robust jitter performance of the new
hybrid NDTL synthesizer outperforms conventional time-delay tanlock loop (TDTL)
synthesizer by orders of magnitude, making it attractive for synthesis even in
Doppler environment. The performance of the hybrid synthesizer was evaluated
under various conditions and the results demonstrate that it achieves the
desired frequency division.

 <dc:title>On the Sensitivity Conjecture for Disjunctive Normal Forms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>S., Karthik C.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The sensitivity conjecture of Nisan and Szegedy [CC '94] asks whether for any
Boolean function $f$, the maximum sensitivity $s(f)$, is polynomially related
to its block sensitivity $bs(f)$, and hence to other major complexity measures.
Despite major advances in the analysis of Boolean functions over the last
decade, the problem remains widely open.
  In this paper, we consider a restriction on the class of Boolean functions
through a model of computation (DNF), and refer to the functions adhering to
this restriction as admitting the Normalized Block property. We prove that for
any function $f$ admitting the Normalized Block property, $bs(f) \leq 4s(f)^2$.
We note that (almost) all the functions mentioned in literature that achieve a
quadratic separation between sensitivity and block sensitivity admit the
Normalized Block property.
  Recently, Gopalan et al. [ITCS '16] showed that every Boolean function $f$ is
uniquely specified by its values on a Hamming ball of radius at most $2s(f)$.
We extend this result and also construct examples of Boolean functions which
provide the matching lower bounds.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a deep learning image segmentation framework that is extremely
robust to missing imaging modalities. Instead of attempting to impute or
synthesize missing data, the proposed approach learns, for each modality, an
embedding of the input image into a single latent vector space for which
arithmetic operations (such as taking the mean) are well defined. Points in
that space, which are averaged over modalities available at inference time, can
then be further processed to yield the desired segmentation. As such, any
combinatorial subset of available modalities can be provided as input, without
having to learn a combinatorial number of imputation models. Evaluated on two
neurological MRI datasets (brain tumors and MS lesions), the approach yields
state-of-the-art segmentation results when provided with all modalities;
moreover, its performance degrades remarkably gracefully when modalities are
removed, significantly more so than alternative mean-filling or other synthesis
approaches.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present the Bag-of-Attributes (BoA) model for video
representation aiming at video event retrieval. The BoA model is based on a
semantic feature space for representing videos, resulting in high-level video
feature vectors. For creating a semantic space, i.e., the attribute space, we
can train a classifier using a labeled image dataset, obtaining a
classification model that can be understood as a high-level codebook. This
model is used to map low-level frame vectors into high-level vectors (e.g.,
classifier probability scores). Then, we apply pooling operations on the frame
vectors to create the final bag of attributes for the video. In the BoA
representation, each dimension corresponds to one category (or attribute) of
the semantic space. Other interesting properties are: compactness, flexibility
regarding the classifier, and ability to encode multiple semantic concepts in a
single video representation. Our experiments considered the semantic space
created by a deep convolutional neural network (OverFeat) pre-trained on 1000
object categories of ImageNet. OverFeat was then used to classify each video
frame and max pooling combined the frame vectors in the BoA representation for
the video. Results using BoA outperformed the baselines with statistical
significance in the task of video event retrieval using the EVVE dataset.

 <dc:title>Polynomial Lower Bound for Distributed Graph Coloring in a Weak LOCAL

 <dc:description>  We show an $\Omega\big(\Delta^{\frac{1}{3}-\frac{\eta}{3}}\big)$ lower bound
on the runtime of any deterministic distributed
$\mathcal{O}\big(\Delta^{1+\eta}\big)$-graph coloring algorithm in a weak
variant of the \LOCAL\ model.
  In particular, given a network graph \mbox{$G=(V,E)$}, in the weak \LOCAL\
model nodes communicate in synchronous rounds and they can use unbounded local
computation. We assume that the nodes have no identifiers, but that instead,
the computation starts with an initial valid vertex coloring. A node can
\textbf{broadcast} a \textbf{single} message of \textbf{unbounded} size to its
neighbors and receives the \textbf{set of messages} sent to it by its
neighbors. That is, if two neighbors of a node $v\in V$ send the same message
to $v$, $v$ will receive this message only a single time; without any further
knowledge, $v$ cannot know whether a received message was sent by only one or
more than one neighbor.
  Neighborhood graphs have been essential in the proof of lower bounds for
distributed coloring algorithms, e.g., \cite{linial92,Kuhn2006On}. Our proof
analyzes the recursive structure of the neighborhood graph of the respective
model to devise an $\Omega\big(\Delta^{\frac{1}{3}-\frac{\eta}{3}}\big)$ lower
bound on the runtime for any deterministic distributed
$\mathcal{O}\big(\Delta^{1+\eta}\big)$-graph coloring algorithm.
  Furthermore, we hope that the proof technique improves the understanding of
neighborhood graphs in general and that it will help towards finding a lower
(runtime) bound for distributed graph coloring in the standard \LOCAL\ model.
Our proof technique works for one-round algorithms in the standard \LOCAL\
model and provides a simpler and more intuitive proof for an existing
$\Omega(\Delta^2)$ lower bound.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multi-population evolutionary algorithms are, by nature, highly complex and
difficult to describe. Even two populations working in concert (or opposition)
present a myriad of potential configurations that are often difficult to relate
using text alone. Little effort has been made, however, to depict these kinds
of systems, relying solely on the simple structural connections (related using
ad hoc diagrams) between populations and often leaving out crucial details. In
this paper, we propose a notation and accompanying formalism for consistently
and powerfully depicting these structures and the relationships within them in
an intuitive and consistent way. Using our notation, we examine simple
co-evolutionary systems and discover new configurations by the simple process
of &quot;drawing on a whiteboard&quot;. Finally, we demonstrate that even complex,
highly-interconnected systems with large numbers of populations can be
understood with ease using the advanced features of our formalism

 <dc:title>Generative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (G-SLAM)</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zikos, Nikos</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Environment perception is a crucial ability for robot's interaction into an
environment. One of the first steps in this direction is the combined problem
of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). A new method, called G-SLAM,
is proposed, where the map is considered as a set of scattered points in the
continuous space followed by a probability that states the existence of an
obstacle in the subsequent point in space. A probabilistic approach with
particle filters for the robot's pose estimation and an adaptive recursive
algorithm for the map's probability distribution estimation is presented. Key
feature of the G-SLAM method is the adaptive repositioning of the scattered
points and their convergence around obstacles. In this paper the goal is to
estimate the best robot trajectory along with the probability distribution of
the obstacles in space. For experimental purposes a four wheel rear drive car
kinematic model is used and results derived from real case scenarios are
discussed.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of detecting a structured, low-rank signal matrix
corrupted with additive Gaussian noise. This includes clustering in a Gaussian
mixture model, sparse PCA, and submatrix localization. Each of these problems
is conjectured to exhibit a sharp information-theoretic threshold, below which
the signal is too weak for any algorithm to detect. We derive upper and lower
bounds on these thresholds by applying the first and second moment methods to
the likelihood ratio between these &quot;planted models&quot; and null models where the
signal matrix is zero. Our bounds differ by at most a factor of root two when
the rank is large (in the clustering and submatrix localization problems, when
the number of clusters or blocks is large) or the signal matrix is very sparse.
Moreover, our upper bounds show that for each of these problems there is a
significant regime where reliable detection is information- theoretically
possible but where known algorithms such as PCA fail completely, since the
spectrum of the observed matrix is uninformative. This regime is analogous to
the conjectured 'hard but detectable' regime for community detection in sparse
graphs.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: For sparse PCA and submatrix localization, we determine the
  information-theoretic threshold exactly in the limit where the number of
  blocks is large or the signal matrix is very sparse based on a conditional
  second moment method, closing the factor of root two gap in the first version</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  Multimedia contents are inherently sensitive signals that must be protected
whenever they are outsourced to an untrusted environment. This problem becomes
a challenge when the untrusted environment must perform some processing on the
sensitive signals; a paradigmatic example is Cloud-based signal processing
services. Approaches based on Secure Signal Processing (SSP) address this
challenge by proposing novel mechanisms for signal processing in the encrypted
domain and interactive secure protocols to achieve the goal of protecting
signals without disclosing the sensitive information they convey.
  This work presents a novel and comprehensive set of approaches and primitives
to efficiently process signals in an encrypted form, by using Number Theoretic
Transforms (NTTs) in innovative ways. This usage of NTTs paired with
appropriate signal pre- and post-coding enables a whole range of easily
composable signal processing operations comprising, among others, filtering,
generalized convolutions, matrix-based processing or error correcting codes.
The main focus is on unattended processing, in which no interaction from the
client is needed; for implementation purposes, efficient lattice-based somewhat
homomorphic cryptosystems are used. We exemplify these approaches and evaluate
their performance and accuracy, proving that the proposed framework opens up a
wide variety of new applications for secured outsourced-processing of
multimedia contents.

one hand, augments L2S s notion of search space and, on the other hand,
enhances RNNs training procedure to be more robust to compounding errors
arising from training on highly correlated examples.

 <dc:description>  The &quot;Ring Learning with Errors&quot; (RLWE) problem was formulated as a variant of
the &quot;Learning with Errors&quot; (LWE) problem, with the purpose of taking advantage
of an additional algebraic structure in the underlying considered lattices;
this enables improvements on the efficiency and cipher expansion on those
cryptographic applications which were previously based on the LWE problem. In
Eurocrypt 2010, Lyubashevsky et al. introduced this hardness problem and showed
its relation to some known hardness problems over lattices with a special
structure. In this work, we generalize these results and the problems presented
by Lyubashevsky et al. to the more general case of multivariate rings,
highlighting the main differences with respect to the security proof for the
RLWE counterpart. This hardness problem is denoted as &quot;Multivariate Ring
Learning with Errors&quot; ($m$-RLWE or multivariate RLWE) and we show its relation
to hardness problems over the tensor product of ideal lattices. Additionally,
the $m$-RLWE problem is more adequate than its univariate version for
cryptographic applications dealing with multidimensional structures.

taught at the Bellairs Research Institute in Barbados, February 21-25, 2016.
The focus is quantum circuit complexity---i.e., the minimum number of gates
needed to prepare a given quantum state or apply a given unitary
transformation---as a unifying theme tying together several topics of recent
interest in the field. Those topics include the power of quantum proofs and
advice states; how to construct quantum money schemes secure against
counterfeiting; and the role of complexity in the black-hole information
paradox and the AdS/CFT correspondence (through connections made by
Harlow-Hayden, Susskind, and others). The course was taught to a mixed audience
of theoretical computer scientists and quantum gravity / string theorists, and
starts out with a crash course on quantum information and computation in
general.

 <dc:description>  Segmentation of focal (localized) brain pathologies such as brain tumors and
brain lesions caused by multiple sclerosis and ischemic strokes are necessary
for medical diagnosis, surgical planning and disease development as well as
other applications such as tractography. Over the years, attempts have been
made to automate this process for both clinical and research reasons. In this
regard, machine learning methods have long been a focus of attention. Over the
past two years, the medical imaging field has seen a rise in the use of a
particular branch of machine learning commonly known as deep learning. In the
non-medical computer vision world, deep learning based methods have obtained
state-of-the-art results on many datasets. Recent studies in computer aided
diagnostics have shown deep learning methods (and especially convolutional
neural networks - CNN) to yield promising results. In this chapter, we provide
a survey of CNN methods applied to medical imaging with a focus on brain
pathology segmentation. In particular, we discuss their characteristic
peculiarities and their specific configuration and adjustments that are best
suited to segment medical images. We also underline the intrinsic differences
deep learning methods have with other machine learning methods.

 <dc:description>  Recently de Palma et al. [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 63, 728 (2017)]
proved---using Lagrange multiplier techniques---that under a non-zero input
entropy constraint, a thermal state input minimizes the output entropy of a
pure-loss bosonic channel. In this note, we present our attempt to generalize
this result to all single-mode gauge-covariant Gaussian channels by using
similar techniques. Unlike the case of the pure-loss channel, we cannot prove
that the thermal input state is the only local extremum of the optimization
problem. %It is unclear to us why the same techniques do not lead to a proof
for amplifier channels. However, we do prove that, if the conjecture holds for
gauge-covariant Gaussian channels, it would also hold for gauge-contravariant
Gaussian channels. The truth of the latter leads to a solution of the triple
trade-off and broadcast capacities of quantum-limited amplifier channels. We
note that de Palma et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 160503 (2017)] have now proven
the conjecture for all single-mode gauge-covariant Gaussian channels by
employing a different approach from what we outline here. Proving a multi-mode
generalization of de Palma et al.'s above mentioned result---i.e., given a
lower bound on the von Neumann entropy of the input to an $n$-mode lossy
thermal-noise bosonic channel, an $n$-mode product thermal state input
minimizes the output entropy---will establish an important special case of the
conjectured Entropy Photon-number Inequality (EPnI). The EPnI, if proven true,
would take on a role analogous to Shannon's EPI in proving coding theorem
converses involving quantum limits of classical communication over bosonic
channels.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of identifying individuals based on their characteristic
gaze patterns during reading of arbitrary text. The motivation for this problem
is an unobtrusive biometric setting in which a user is observed during access
to a document, but no specific challenge protocol requiring the user's time and
attention is carried out. Existing models of individual differences in gaze
control during reading are either based on simple aggregate features of eye
movements, or rely on parametric density models to describe, for instance,
saccade amplitudes or word fixation durations. We develop flexible
semiparametric models of eye movements during reading in which densities are
inferred under a Gaussian process prior centered at a parametric distribution
family that is expected to approximate the true distribution well. An empirical
study on reading data from 251 individuals shows significant improvements over
the state of the art.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem where a mobile search agent seeks to find an unknown
number of stationary objects distributed in a bounded search domain, and the
search mission is subject to time/distance constraint. Our work accounts for
false positives, false negatives and environmental uncertainty. We consider the
case that the performance of a search sensor is dependent on the environment
(e.g., clutter density), and therefore sensor performance is better in some
locations than in others. For applications where environmental information can
be acquired, we derive a decision-theoretic cost function to compute the
locations where the environmental information should be acquired. We address
the cases where environmental characterization is performed either by a
separate vehicle or by the same vehicle that performs the search task.

 <dc:description>  In order to create effective storytelling agents three fundamental questions
must be answered: first, is a physically embodied agent preferable to a virtual
agent or a voice-only narration? Second, does a human voice have an advantage
over a synthesised voice? Third, how should the emotional trajectory of the
different characters in a story be related to a storyteller's facial
expressions during storytelling time, and how does this correlate with the
apparent emotions on the faces of the listeners? The results of two specially
designed studies indicate that the physically embodied robot produces more
attention to the listener as compared to a virtual embodiment, that a human
voice is preferable over the current state of the art of text-to-speech, and
that there is a complex yet interesting relation between the emotion lines of
the story, the facial expressions of the narrating agent, and the emotions of
the listener, and that the empathising of the listener is evident through its
facial expressions. This work constitutes an important step towards emotional
storytelling robots that can observe their listeners and adapt their style in
order to maximise their effectiveness.

 <dc:description>  We consider an amplify-and-forward relay network composed of a source, two
relays, and a destination. In this network, the two relays are untrusted in the
sense that they may perform Byzantine attacks by forwarding altered symbols to
the destination. Note that every symbol received by the destination may be
altered, and hence no clean reference observation is available to the
destination. For this network, we identify a large family of Byzantine attacks
that can be detected in the physical layer. We further investigate how the
channel conditions impact the detection against this family of attacks. In
particular, we prove that all Byzantine attacks in this family can be detected
with asymptotically small miss detection and false alarm probabilities by using
a sufficiently large number of channel observations \emph{if and only if} the
network satisfies a non-manipulability condition. No pre-shared secret or
secret transmission is needed for the detection of these attacks, demonstrating
the value of this physical-layer security technique for counteracting Byzantine
attacks.

 <dc:title>Downlink MIMO HCNs with Residual Transceiver Hardware Impairments</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A major limitation of heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) is the neglect
of the additive residual transceiver hardware impairments (ARTHIs). The
assumption of perfect hardware is quite strong and results in misleading
conclusions. This paper models a general multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
HCN with cell association by incorporating the RTHIs. We derive the coverage
probability and shed light on the impact of the ARTHIs, when various
transmission methods are applied. As the hardware quality decreases, the
coverage probability worsens. Especially, this effect is more severe as the
transmit power increases. Furthermore, we verify that in an HCN, it is better
to employ at each base station as few transmit antennas as possible.

 <dc:description>  Our goal is to recognize material categories using images and geometry
information. In many applications, such as construction management, coarse
geometry information is available. We investigate how 3D geometry (surface
normals, camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters) can be used with 2D
features (texture and color) to improve material classification. We introduce a
new dataset, GeoMat, which is the first to provide both image and geometry data
in the form of: (i) training and testing patches that were extracted at
different scales and perspectives from real world examples of each material
category, and (ii) a large scale construction site scene that includes 160
images and over 800,000 hand labeled 3D points. Our results show that using 2D
and 3D features both jointly and independently to model materials improves
classification accuracy across multiple scales and viewing directions for both
material patches and images of a large scale construction site scene.

 <dc:description>  In the classic Integer Programming (IP) problem, the objective is to decide
whether, for a given $m \times n$ matrix $A$ and an $m$-vector $b=(b_1,\dots,
b_m)$, there is a non-negative integer $n$-vector $x$ such that $Ax=b$. Solving
(IP) is an important step in numerous algorithms and it is important to obtain
an understanding of the precise complexity of this problem as a function of
natural parameters of the input. Two significant results in this line of
research are the pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for (IP) when the number of
constraints is a constant [Papadimitriou, J. ACM 1981] and when the
branch-width of the column-matroid corresponding to the constraint matrix is a
constant [Cunningham and Geelen, IPCO 2007]. In this paper, we prove matching
upper and lower bounds for (IP) when the path-width of the corresponding
column-matroid is a constant. These lower bounds provide evidence that the
algorithm of Cunningham and Geelen, are probably optimal. We also obtain a
separate lower bound providing evidence that the algorithm of Papadimitriou is
close to optimal.

 <dc:description>  Quorum systems are useful tools for implementing consistent and available
storage in the presence of failures. These systems usually comprise a static
set of servers that provide a fault-tolerant read/write register accessed by a
set of clients. We consider a dynamic variant of these systems and propose
FreeStore, a set of fault-tolerant protocols that emulates a register in
dynamic asynchronous systems in which processes are able to join/leave the
servers set during the execution. These protocols use a new abstraction called
view generators, that captures the agreement requirements of reconfiguration
and can be implemented in different system models with different properties.
Particularly interesting, we present a reconfiguration protocol that is
modular, efficient, consensus-free and loosely coupled with read/write
protocols, improving the overall system performance.

 <dc:description>  Large-scale antenna (LSA) has gained a lot of attention recently since it can
significantly improve the performance of wireless systems. Similar to
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) or MIMO-OFDM, LSA can be also combined with OFDM to deal
with frequency selectivity in wireless channels. However, such combination
suffers from substantially increased complexity proportional to the number of
antennas in LSA systems. For the conventional implementation of LSA-OFDM, the
number of inverse fast Fourier transforms (IFFTs) increases with the antenna
number since each antenna requires an IFFT for OFDM modulation. Furthermore,
zero-forcing (ZF) precoding is required in LSA systems to support more users,
and the required matrix inversion leads to a huge computational burden. In this
paper, we propose a low-complexity recursive convolutional precoding to address
the issues above. The traditional ZF precoding can be implemented through the
recursive convolutional precoding in the time domain so that only one IFFT is
required for each user and the matrix inversion can be also avoided. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach can achieve the same performance as
that of ZF but with much lower complexity.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by automated junction recognition in tracking data, we study a
problem of placing a square or disc of fixed size in an arrangement of lines or
line segments in the plane. We let distances among the intersection points of
the lines and line segments with the square or circle define a clustering, and
study the complexity of \emph{critical} placements for this clustering. Here
critical means that arbitrarily small movements of the placement change the
clustering.
  A parameter $\varepsilon$ defines the granularity of the clustering. Without
any assumptions on $\varepsilon$, the critical placements have a trivial
$O(n^4)$ upper bound. When the square or circle has unit size and $0 &lt;
\varepsilon &lt; 1$ is given, we show a refined $O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ bound,
which is tight in the worst case.
  We use our combinatorial bounds to design efficient algorithms to compute
junctions. As a proof of concept for our algorithms we have a prototype
implementation that showcases their application in a basic visualization of a
set of $n$ trajectories and their $k$ most important junctions.

approach has a great potential to facilitate such tasks; however, it has a
number of limitations in dealing with analytics that restrict its use in
important industrial applications. Based on our experience with Siemens, we
argue that in order to overcome those limitations OBDA should be extended and
become analytics, source, and cost aware. In this work we propose such an
extension. In particular, we propose an ontology, mapping, and query language
for OBDA, where aggregate and other analytical functions are first class
citizens. Moreover, we develop query optimisation techniques that allow to
efficiently process analytical tasks over static and streaming data. We
implement our approach in a system and evaluate our system with Siemens turbine
data.

 <dc:description>  Conventional load-testing tools are based on a fifty-year old time-share
computer paradigm where a finite number of users submit requests and respond in
a synchronized fashion. Conversely, modern web traffic is essentially
asynchronous and driven by an unknown number of users. This difference presents
a conundrum for testing the performance of modern web applications. Even when
the difference is recognized, performance engineers often introduce
modifications to their test scripts based on folklore or hearsay published in
various Internet fora, much of which can lead to wrong results. We present a
coherent methodology, based on two fundamental principles, for emulating web
traffic using a standard load-test environment.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Le and Mikolov (2014) proposed doc2vec as an extension to word2vec
(Mikolov et al., 2013a) to learn document-level embeddings. Despite promising
results in the original paper, others have struggled to reproduce those
results. This paper presents a rigorous empirical evaluation of doc2vec over
two tasks. We compare doc2vec to two baselines and two state-of-the-art
document embedding methodologies. We found that doc2vec performs robustly when
using models trained on large external corpora, and can be further improved by
using pre-trained word embeddings. We also provide recommendations on
hyper-parameter settings for general purpose applications, and release source
code to induce document embeddings using our trained doc2vec models.

 <dc:description>  Person re-identification (ReID) focuses on identifying people across
different scenes in video surveillance, which is usually formulated as a binary
classification task or a ranking task in current person ReID approaches. In
this paper, we take both tasks into account and propose a multi-task deep
network (MTDnet) that makes use of their own advantages and jointly optimize
the two tasks simultaneously for person ReID. To the best of our knowledge, we
are the first to integrate both tasks in one network to solve the person ReID.
We show that our proposed architecture significantly boosts the performance.
Furthermore, deep architecture in general requires a sufficient dataset for
training, which is usually not met in person ReID. To cope with this situation,
we further extend the MTDnet and propose a cross-domain architecture that is
capable of using an auxiliary set to assist training on small target sets. In
the experiments, our approach outperforms most of existing person ReID
algorithms on representative datasets including CUHK03, CUHK01, VIPeR, iLIDS
and PRID2011, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

 <dc:description>  The communication networks in real world often couple with each other to save
costs, which results in any network does not have a stand-alone function and
efficiency. To investigate this, in this paper we propose a transportation
model on two coupled networks with bandwidth sharing. We find that the
free-flow state and the congestion state can coexist in the two coupled
networks, and the free-flow path and congestion path can coexist in each
network. Considering three bandwidth-sharing mechanisms, random, assortative
and disassortative couplings, we also find that the transportation capacity of
the network only depends on the coupling mechanism, and the fraction of coupled
links only affects the performance of the system in the congestion state, such
as the traveling time. In addition, with assortative coupling, the
transportation capacity of the system will decrease significantly. However, the
disassortative coupling has little influence on the transportation capacity of
the system, which provides a good strategy to save bandwidth. Furthermore, a
theoretical method is developed to obtain the bandwidth usage of each link,
based on which we can obtain the congestion transition point exactly.

 <dc:description>  Image generation remains a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence in
general and deep learning in specific. The generative adversarial network (GAN)
was successful in generating high quality samples of natural images. We propose
a model called composite generative adversarial network, that reveals the
complex structure of images with multiple generators in which each generator
generates some part of the image. Those parts are combined by alpha blending
process to create a new single image. It can generate, for example, background
and face sequentially with two generators, after training on face dataset.
Training was done in an unsupervised way without any labels about what each
generator should generate. We found possibilities of learning the structure by
using this generative model empirically.

 <dc:title>Genetic Transfer or Population Diversification? Deciphering the Secret
  Ingredients of Evolutionary Multitask Optimization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gupta, Abhishek</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ong, Yew-Soon</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Evolutionary multitasking has recently emerged as a novel paradigm that
enables the similarities and/or latent complementarities (if present) between
distinct optimization tasks to be exploited in an autonomous manner simply by
solving them together with a unified solution representation scheme. An
important matter underpinning future algorithmic advancements is to develop a
better understanding of the driving force behind successful multitask
problem-solving. In this regard, two (seemingly disparate) ideas have been put
forward, namely, (a) implicit genetic transfer as the key ingredient
facilitating the exchange of high-quality genetic material across tasks, and
(b) population diversification resulting in effective global search of the
unified search space encompassing all tasks. In this paper, we present some
empirical results that provide a clearer picture of the relationship between
the two aforementioned propositions. For the numerical experiments we make use
of Sudoku puzzles as case studies, mainly because of their feature that
outwardly unlike puzzle statements can often have nearly identical final
solutions. The experiments reveal that while on many occasions genetic transfer
and population diversity may be viewed as two sides of the same coin, the wider
implication of genetic transfer, as shall be shown herein, captures the true
essence of evolutionary multitasking to the fullest.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes two approaches for inferencing binary codes in two-step
(supervised, unsupervised) hashing. We first introduce an unified formulation
for both supervised and unsupervised hashing. Then, we cast the learning of one
bit as a Binary Quadratic Problem (BQP). We propose two approaches to solve
BQP. In the first approach, we relax BQP as a semidefinite programming problem
which its global optimum can be achieved. We theoretically prove that the
objective value of the binary solution achieved by this approach is well
bounded. In the second approach, we propose an augmented Lagrangian based
approach to solve BQP directly without relaxing the binary constraint.
Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our proposed methods
compare favorably with the state of the art.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of a seller dynamically pricing $d$ distinct types of
indivisible goods, when faced with the online arrival of unit-demand buyers
drawn independently from an unknown distribution. The goods are not in limited
supply, but can only be produced at a limited rate and are costly to produce.
The seller observes only the bundle of goods purchased at each day, but nothing
else about the buyer's valuation function. Our main result is a dynamic pricing
algorithm for optimizing welfare (including the seller's cost of production)
that runs in time and a number of rounds that are polynomial in $d$ and the
approximation parameter. We are able to do this despite the fact that (i) the
price-response function is not continuous, and even its fractional relaxation
is a non-concave function of the prices, and (ii) the welfare is not observable
to the seller.
  We derive this result as an application of a general technique for optimizing
welfare over \emph{divisible} goods, which is of independent interest. When
buyers have strongly concave, H\&quot;older continuous valuation functions over $d$
divisible goods, we give a general polynomial time dynamic pricing technique.
We are able to apply this technique to the setting of unit demand buyers
despite the fact that in that setting the goods are not divisible, and the
natural fractional relaxation of a unit demand valuation is not strongly
concave. In order to apply our general technique, we introduce a novel price
randomization procedure which has the effect of implicitly inducing buyers to
&quot;regularize&quot; their valuations with a strongly concave function. Finally, we
also extend our results to a limited-supply setting in which the number of
copies of each good cannot be replenished.

controller and web-based teleoperation to enable any device with a web browser
to access and control a humanoid robot. By integrating humanoid robots with the
cloud, they are accessible from any Internet-connected device. Increased
accessibility is important because few people have access to state-of-the-art
humanoid robots limiting their rate of development. CARL's implementation is
based on modern software libraries, frameworks, and middleware including
Node.js, Socket.IO, ZMQ, ROS, Robot Web Tools, and ControlIt! Feasibility is
demonstrated by having inexperienced human operators use a smartphone's
web-browser to control Dreamer, a torque-controlled humanoid robot based on
series elastic actuators, and make it perform a dual-arm manipulation task. The
implementation serves as a proof-of-concept and foundation upon which many
advanced humanoid robot technologies can be researched and developed.

 <dc:title>Grounded Fixpoints and Active Integrity Constraints</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cruz-Filipe, Lu&#xed;s</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The formalism of active integrity constraints was introduced as a way to
specify particular classes of integrity constraints over relational databases
together with preferences on how to repair existing inconsistencies. The
rule-based syntax of such integrity constraints also provides algorithms for
finding such repairs that achieve the best asymptotic complexity. However, the
different semantics that have been proposed for these integrity constraints all
exhibit some counter-intuitive examples. In this work, we look at active
integrity constraints using ideas from algebraic fixpoint theory. We show how
database repairs can be modeled as fixpoints of particular operators on
databases, and study how the notion of grounded fixpoint induces a
corresponding notion of grounded database repair that captures several natural
intuitions, and in particular avoids the problems of previous alternative
semantics. In order to study grounded repairs in their full generality, we need
to generalize the notion of grounded fixpoint to non-deterministic operators.
We propose such a definition and illustrate its plausibility in the database
context.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel dynamic configuration technique for deep neural networks
that permits step-wise energy-accuracy trade-offs during runtime. Our
configuration technique adjusts the number of channels in the network
dynamically depending on response time, power, and accuracy targets. To enable
this dynamic configuration technique, we co-design a new training algorithm,
where the network is incrementally trained such that the weights in channels
trained in earlier steps are fixed. Our technique provides the flexibility of
multiple networks while storing and utilizing one set of weights. We evaluate
our techniques using both an ASIC-based hardware accelerator as well as a
low-power embedded GPGPU and show that our approach leads to only a small or
negligible loss in the final network accuracy. We analyze the performance of
our proposed methodology using three well-known networks for MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and SVHN datasets, and we show that we are able to achieve up to 95% energy
reduction with less than 1% accuracy loss across the three benchmarks. In
addition, compared to prior work on dynamic network reconfiguration, we show
that our approach leads to approximately 50% savings in storage requirements,
while achieving similar accuracy.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study sums of powers of affine functions in (mostly) one
variable. Although quite simple, this model is a generalization of two
well-studied models: Waring decomposition and sparsest shift. For these three
models there are natural extensions to several variables, but this paper is
mostly focused on univariate polynomials. We present structural results which
compare the expressive power of the three models; and we propose algorithms
that find the smallest decomposition of f in the first model (sums of affine
powers) for an input polynomial f given in dense representation. We also begin
a study of the multivariate case. This work could be extended in several
directions. In particular, just as for Sparsest Shift and Waring decomposition,
one could consider extensions to &quot;supersparse&quot; polynomials and attempt a fuller
study of the multi-variate case. We also point out that the basic univariate
problem studied in the present paper is far from completely solved: our
algorithms all rely on some assumptions for the exponents in an optimal
decomposition, and some algorithms also rely on a distinctness assumption for
the shifts. It would be very interesting to weaken these assumptions, or even
to remove them entirely. Another related and poorly understood issue is that of
the bit size of the constants appearing in an optimal decomposition: is it
always polynomially related to the bit size of the input polynomial given in
dense representation?

 <dc:description>  Information content (IC) based measures for finding semantic similarity is
gaining preferences day by day. Semantics of concepts can be highly
characterized by information theory. The conventional way for calculating IC is
based on the probability of appearance of concepts in corpora. Due to data
sparseness and corpora dependency issues of those conventional approaches, a
new corpora independent intrinsic IC calculation measure has evolved. In this
paper, we mainly focus on such intrinsic IC model and several topological
aspects of the underlying ontology. Accuracy of intrinsic IC calculation and
semantic similarity measure rely on these aspects deeply. Based on these
analysis we propose an information theoretic framework which comprises an
intrinsic IC calculator and a semantic similarity model. Our approach is
compared with state of the art semantic similarity measures based on corpora
dependent IC calculation as well as intrinsic IC based methods using several
benchmark data set. We also compare our model with the related Edge based,
Feature based and Distributional approaches. Experimental results show that our
intrinsic IC model gives high correlation value when applied to different
semantic similarity models. Our proposed semantic similarity model also
achieves significant results when embedded with some state of the art IC models
including ours.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
practical problems. However, due to the inherent large parameter space, deep
models are notoriously prone to overfitting and difficult to be deployed in
portable devices with limited memory. In this paper, we propose an iterative
hard thresholding (IHT) approach to train Skinny Deep Neural Networks (SDNNs).
An SDNN has much fewer parameters yet can achieve competitive or even better
performance than its full CNN counterpart. More concretely, the IHT approach
trains an SDNN through following two alternative phases: (I) perform hard
thresholding to drop connections with small activations and fine-tune the other
significant filters; (II)~re-activate the frozen connections and train the
entire network to improve its overall discriminative capability. We verify the
superiority of SDNNs in terms of efficiency and classification performance on
four benchmark object recognition datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST and ImageNet. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that IHT can be
applied for training SDNN based on various CNN architectures such as NIN and
AlexNet.

 <dc:description>  Communications at frequencies above 10 GHz (the mmWave band) are expected to
play a major role for the next generation of cellular networks (5G), because of
the potential multi-gigabit, ultra-low latency performance of this technology.
mmWave frequencies however suffer from very high isotropic pathloss, which may
result in cells with a much smaller coverage area than current LTE macrocells.
High directionality techniques will be used to improve signal quality and
extend coverage area, along with a high density deployment of mmWave base
stations (BS). However, when propagation conditions are hard and it is
difficult to provide high quality coverage with mmWave BS, it is necessary to
rely on previous generation LTE base stations, which make use of lower
frequencies (900 MHz - 3.5 GHz), which are less sensitive to blockage and
experience lower pathloss. In order to provide ultra-reliable services to
mobile users there is a need for network architectures that tightly and
seamlessly integrate the LTE and mmWave Radio Access Technologies. In this
paper we will present two possible alternatives for this integration and show
how simulation tools can be used to assess and compare their performance.

 <dc:title>Trunk-Branch Ensemble Convolutional Neural Networks for Video-based Face
  Recognition</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Human faces in surveillance videos often suffer from severe image blur,
dramatic pose variations, and occlusion. In this paper, we propose a
comprehensive framework based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to
overcome challenges in video-based face recognition (VFR). First, to learn
blur-robust face representations, we artificially blur training data composed
of clear still images to account for a shortfall in real-world video training
data. Using training data composed of both still images and artificially
blurred data, CNN is encouraged to learn blur-insensitive features
automatically. Second, to enhance robustness of CNN features to pose variations
and occlusion, we propose a Trunk-Branch Ensemble CNN model (TBE-CNN), which
extracts complementary information from holistic face images and patches
cropped around facial components. TBE-CNN is an end-to-end model that extracts
features efficiently by sharing the low- and middle-level convolutional layers
between the trunk and branch networks. Third, to further promote the
discriminative power of the representations learnt by TBE-CNN, we propose an
improved triplet loss function. Systematic experiments justify the
effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most impressively, TBE-CNN achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three popular video face databases: PaSC, COX
Face, and YouTube Faces. With the proposed techniques, we also obtain the first
place in the BTAS 2016 Video Person Recognition Evaluation.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes the application of the waveform relaxation method to the
homogenization of multiscale magnetoquasistatic problems. In the monolithic
heterogeneous multiscale method, the nonlinear macroscale problem is solved
using the Newton--Raphson scheme. The resolution of many mesoscale problems per
Gauss point allows to compute the homogenized constitutive law and its
derivative by finite differences. In the proposed approach, the macroscale
problem and the mesoscale problems are weakly coupled and solved separately
using the finite element method on time intervals for several waveform
relaxation iterations. The exchange of information between both problems is
still carried out using the heterogeneous multiscale method. However, the
partial derivatives can now be evaluated exactly by solving only one mesoscale
problem per Gauss point.

 <dc:description>  Several variants of the cops and robbers (CR) game have been studied in the
past. In this paper we examine a novel variant, which is played between two
cops, each one independently trying to catch a &quot;passive robber&quot;. We will call
this the Selfish Cops and Passive Robber {SCPR} game. In short, SCPR is a
stochastic two-player, zero-sum game where the opponents are the two cop
players. We study sequential and concurrent versions of the SCPR game. For both
cases we prove the existence of value and optimal strategies and present
algorithms for the computation of these.

 <dc:description>  Intermediate features at different layers of a deep neural network are known
to be discriminative for visual patterns of different complexities. However,
most existing works ignore such cross-layer heterogeneities when classifying
samples of different complexities. For example, if a training sample has
already been correctly classified at a specific layer with high confidence, we
argue that it is unnecessary to enforce rest layers to classify this sample
correctly and a better strategy is to encourage those layers to focus on other
samples.
  In this paper, we propose a layer-wise discriminative learning method to
enhance the discriminative capability of a deep network by allowing its layers
to work collaboratively for classification. Towards this target, we introduce
multiple classifiers on top of multiple layers. Each classifier not only tries
to correctly classify the features from its input layer, but also coordinates
with other classifiers to jointly maximize the final classification
performance. Guided by the other companion classifiers, each classifier learns
to concentrate on certain training examples and boosts the overall performance.
Allowing for end-to-end training, our method can be conveniently embedded into
state-of-the-art deep networks. Experiments with multiple popular deep
networks, including Network in Network, GoogLeNet and VGGNet, on scale-various
object classification benchmarks, including CIFAR100, MNIST and ImageNet, and
scene classification benchmarks, including MIT67, SUN397 and Places205,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In addition, we also analyze the
relationship between the proposed method and classical conditional random
fields models.

 <dc:description>  The cooperative energy management of aggregated buildings has recently
received a great deal of interest due to substantial potential energy savings.
These gains are mainly obtained in two ways: (i) Exploiting the load shifting
capabilities of the cooperative buildings; (ii) Utilizing the expensive but
energy efficient equipment that is commonly shared by the building community
(e.g., heat pumps, batteries and photovoltaics). Several deterministic and
stochastic control schemes that strive to realize these savings, have been
proposed in the literature. A common difficulty with all these methods is
integrating knowledge about the disturbances affecting the system. In this
context, the underlying disturbance distributions are often poorly
characterized based on historical data. In this paper, we address this issue by
exploiting the historical data to construct families of distributions which
contain these underlying distributions with high confidence. We then employ
tools from data-driven robust optimization to formulate a multistage stochastic
optimization problem which can be approximated by a finite-dimensional linear
program. The proposed method is suitable for tackling large scale systems since
its complexity grows polynomially with respect to the system variables. We
demonstrate its efficacy in a numerical study, in which it is shown to
outperform, in terms of energy cost savings and constraint violations,
established solution techniques from the literature. We conclude this study by
showing the significant energy gains that are obtained by cooperatively
managing a collection of buildings with heterogeneous characteristics.

 <dc:description>  Property-based random testing a la QuickCheck requires building efficient
generators for well-distributed random data satisfying complex logical
predicates, but writing these generators can be difficult and error prone. We
propose a domain-specific language in which generators are conveniently
expressed by decorating predicates with lightweight annotations to control both
the distribution of generated values and the amount of constraint solving that
happens before each variable is instantiated. This language, called Luck, makes
generators easier to write, read, and maintain.
  We give Luck a formal semantics and prove several fundamental properties,
including the soundness and completeness of random generation with respect to a
standard predicate semantics. We evaluate Luck on common examples from the
property-based testing literature and on two significant case studies, showing
that it can be used in complex domains with comparable bug-finding
effectiveness and a significant reduction in testing code size compared to
handwritten generators.

 <dc:description>  Some recent works in machine learning and computer vision involve the
solution of a bi-level optimization problem. Here the solution of a
parameterized lower-level problem binds variables that appear in the objective
of an upper-level problem. The lower-level problem typically appears as an
argmin or argmax optimization problem. Many techniques have been proposed to
solve bi-level optimization problems, including gradient descent, which is
popular with current end-to-end learning approaches. In this technical report
we collect some results on differentiating argmin and argmax optimization
problems with and without constraints and provide some insightful motivating
examples.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a systematic approach to exponentially stabilize the
periodic orbits of multi-domain hybrid systems arising from 3D bipedal walking.
Firstly, the method of Poincare sections is extended to the hybrid systems with
multiple domains. Then, based on the properties of the Poincare maps, a
continuous piecewise feedback control strategy is presented, and three methods
are furthermore given to design the controller parameters based on the
developed theorems. By those design methods, the controller parameters in each
continuous phase can be designed independently, which allows the strategy to be
applied to hybrid systems with multiple domains. Finally, the proposed strategy
is illustrated by a simulation example. To show that the proposed strategy is
not limited to bipedal robots with left-right symmetry property which is
assumed in some previous works, an underactuated 3D bipedal robot with
asymmetric walking gait is considered.

 <dc:description>  A Bloom filter is a widely used data-structure for representing a set $S$ and
answering queries of the form &quot;Is $x$ in $S$?&quot;. By allowing some false positive
answers (saying &quot;yes&quot; when the answer is in fact `no') Bloom filters use space
significantly below what is required for storing $S$. In the distance sensitive
setting we work with a set $S$ of (Hamming) vectors and seek a data structure
that offers a similar trade-off, but answers queries of the form &quot;Is $x$ close
to an element of $S$?&quot; (in Hamming distance). Previous work on distance
sensitive Bloom filters have accepted false positive and false negative
answers. Absence of false negatives is of critical importance in many
applications of Bloom filters, so it is natural to ask if this can be also
achieved in the distance sensitive setting. Our main contributions are upper
and lower bounds (that are tight in several cases) for space usage in the
distance sensitive setting where false negatives are not allowed.

 <dc:title>On Secrecy Metrics for Physical Layer Security over Quasi-Static Fading

 <dc:description>  Theoretical studies on physical layer security often adopt the secrecy outage
probability as the performance metric for wireless communications over
quasi-static fading channels. The secrecy outage probability has two
limitations from a practical point of view: a) it does not give any insight
into the eavesdropper's decodability of confidential messages; b) it cannot
characterize the amount of information leakage to the eavesdropper when an
outage occurs. Motivated by the limitations of the secrecy outage probability,
we propose three new secrecy metrics for secure transmissions over quasi-static
fading channels. The first metric establishes a link between the concept of
secrecy outage and the decodability of messages at the eavesdropper. The second
metric provides an error-probability-based secrecy metric which is typically
used for the practical implementation of secure wireless systems. The third
metric characterizes how much or how fast the confidential information is
leaked to the eavesdropper. We show that the proposed secrecy metrics
collectively give a more comprehensive understanding of physical layer security
over fading channels and enable one to appropriately design secure
communication systems with different views on how secrecy is measured.

 <dc:description>  The concept of user-centric and personalized service in the fifth generation
(5G) mobile networks encourages technical solutions such as dynamic asymmetric
uplink/downlink resource allocation and elastic association of cells to users
with decoupled uplink and downlink (DeUD) access. In this paper we develop a
joint uplink and downlink optimization algorithm for DeUD-enabled wireless
networks for adaptive joint uplink and downlink bandwidth allocation and power
control, under different link association policies. Based on a general model of
inter-cell interference, we propose a three-step optimization algorithm to
jointly optimize the uplink and downlink bandwidth allocation and power
control, using the fixed point approach for nonlinear operators with or without
monotonicity, to maximize the minimum level of quality of service satisfaction
per link, subjected to a general class of resource (power and bandwidth)
constraints. We present numerical results illustrating the theoretical findings
for network simulator in a real-world setting, and show the advantage of our
solution compared to the conventional proportional fairness resource allocation
schemes in both the coupled uplink and downlink (CoUD) access and the novel
link association schemes in DeUD.

 <dc:description>  This paper is concerned with the construction of algebraic geometric codes
defined from Kummer extensions. It plays a significant role in the study of
such codes to describe bases for the Riemann-Roch spaces associated with
totally ramified places. Along this line, we give an explicit characterization
of Weierstrass semigroups and pure gaps. Additionally, we determine the floor
of a certain type of divisor introduced by Maharaj, Matthews and Pirsic.
Finally, we apply these results to find multi-point codes with good parameters.
As one of the examples, a presented code with parameters $ [254,228,\geqslant
16] $ over $ \mathbb{F}_{64} $ yields a new record.

 <dc:description>  Large pose variations remain to be a challenge that confronts real-word face
detection. We propose a new cascaded Convolutional Neural Network, dubbed the
name Supervised Transformer Network, to address this challenge. The first stage
is a multi-task Region Proposal Network (RPN), which simultaneously predicts
candidate face regions along with associated facial landmarks. The candidate
regions are then warped by mapping the detected facial landmarks to their
canonical positions to better normalize the face patterns. The second stage,
which is a RCNN, then verifies if the warped candidate regions are valid faces
or not. We conduct end-to-end learning of the cascaded network, including
optimizing the canonical positions of the facial landmarks. This supervised
learning of the transformations automatically selects the best scale to
differentiate face/non-face patterns. By combining feature maps from both
stages of the network, we achieve state-of-the-art detection accuracies on
several public benchmarks. For real-time performance, we run the cascaded
network only on regions of interests produced from a boosting cascade face
detector. Our detector runs at 30 FPS on a single CPU core for a VGA-resolution
image.

 <dc:description>  Maximum Causal Entropy (MCE) Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) has become an
effective tool for modelling human behaviour in many control tasks. Its
advantage over classic techniques for estimating human policies is the
transferability of the inferred objectives: Behaviour can be predicted in
variations of the control task by policy computation using a relaxed optimality
criterion. However, exact policy inference is often computationally intractable
in control problems with imperfect state observation. In this work, we present
a model class that allows modelling human control of two tasks of which only
one be perfectly observed at a time requiring attention switching. We show how
efficient and exact objective and policy inference via MCE can be conducted for
these control problems. Both MCE-IOC and Maximum Causal Likelihood (MCL)-IOC, a
variant of the original MCE approach, as well as Direct Policy Estimation (DPE)
are evaluated using simulated and real behavioural data. Prediction error and
generalization over changes in the control process are both considered in the
evaluation. The results show a clear advantage of both IOC methods over DPE,
especially in the transfer over variation of the control process. MCE and MCL
performed similar when training on a large set of simulated data, but differed
significantly on small sets and real data.

 <dc:description>  One of the fundamental results in quantum foundations is the Kochen-Specker
no-go theorem. For the quantum theory, the no-go theorem excludes the
possibility of a class of hidden variable models where value attribution is
context independent. Recently, the notion of contextuality has been generalized
for different operational procedures and it has been shown that preparation
contextuality of mixed quantum states can be a useful resource in an
information-processing task called parity-oblivious multiplexing. Here, we
introduce a new class of information processing tasks, namely d-level parity
oblivious random access codes and obtain bounds on the success probabilities of
performing such tasks in any preparation noncontextual theory. These bounds
constitute noncontextuality inequalities for any value of d. For d=3, using a
set of mutually asymmetric biased bases we show that the corresponding
noncontextual bound is violated by quantum theory. We also show quantum
violation of the inequalities for some other higher values of d. This reveals
operational usefulness of preparation contextuality of higher level quantum
systems.

 <dc:description>  The method of partial derivatives is one of the most successful lower bound
methods for arithmetic circuits. It uses as a complexity measure the dimension
of the span of the partial derivatives of a polynomial. In this paper, we
consider this complexity measure as a computational problem: for an input
polynomial given as the sum of its nonzero monomials, what is the complexity of
computing the dimension of its space of partial derivatives? We show that this
problem is #P-hard and we ask whether it belongs to #P. We analyze the &quot;trace
method&quot;, recently used in combinatorics and in algebraic complexity to lower
bound the rank of certain matrices. We show that this method provides a
polynomial-time computable lower bound on the dimension of the span of partial
derivatives, and from this method we derive closed-form lower bounds. We leave
as an open problem the existence of an approximation algorithm with reasonable
performance guarantees.A slightly shorter version of this paper was presented
at STACS'17. In this new version we have corrected a typo in Section 4.1, and
added a reference to Shitov's work on tensor rank.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes distributed algorithms to solve robust convex
optimization (RCO) when the constraints are affected by nonlinear uncertainty.
We adopt a scenario approach by randomly sampling the uncertainty set. To
facilitate the computational task, instead of using a single centralized
processor to obtain a &quot;global solution&quot; of the scenario problem (SP), we resort
to {\it multiple interconnected processors} that are distributed among
different nodes of a network to simultaneously solve the SP. Then, we propose a
primal-dual sub-gradient algorithm and a random projection algorithm to
distributedly solve the SP over undirected and directed graphs, respectively.
Both algorithms are given in an explicit recursive form with simple iterations,
which are especially suited for processors with limited computational
capability. We show that, if the underlying graph is strongly connected, each
node asymptotically computes a common optimal solution to the SP with a
convergence rate $O(1/(\sum_{t=1}^k\zeta^t))$ where $\{\zeta^t\}$ is a sequence
of appropriately decreasing stepsizes. That is, the RCO is effectively solved
in a distributed way. The relations with the existing literature on robust
convex programs are thoroughly discussed and an example of robust system
identification is included to validate the effectiveness of our distributed
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Recent research demonstrated that mutation-based fault localization
techniques are relatively accurate and practical. However, these methods have
never been compared and have only been assessed with simple hand-seeded faults.
Therefore, their actual practicality is questionable when it comes to real-wold
faults. To deal with this limitation we asses and compare the two main
mutation-based fault localization methods, named Metallaxis and MUSE, on a set
of real-world programs and faults. Our results based on three typical
evaluation metrics indicate that mutation-based fault localization methods are
relatively accurate and provide relevant information to developers. Overall,
our result indicate that Metallaxis and MUSE require 18% and 37% of the program
statements to find the sought faults. Additionally, both methods locate 50% and
80% of the studied faults when developers inspect 10 and 25 statements.

 <dc:description>  We consider the fundamental Matroid Theory problem of finding a circuit in a
matroid spanning a set T of given terminal elements. For graphic matroids this
corresponds to the problem of finding a simple cycle passing through a set of
given terminal edges in a graph. The algorithmic study of the problem on
regular matroids, a superclass of graphic matroids, was initiated by
Gaven\v{c}iak, Kr\'al', and Oum [ICALP'12], who proved that the case of the
problem with |T|=2 is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the
length of the circuit. We extend the result of Gaven\v{c}iak, Kr\'al', and Oum
by showing that for regular matroids
  - the Minimum Spanning Circuit problem, deciding whether there is a circuit
with at most \ell elements containing T, is FPT parameterized by k=\ell-|T|;
  - the Spanning Circuit problem, deciding whether there is a circuit
containing T, is FPT parameterized by |T|. We note that extending our
algorithmic findings to binary matroids, a superclass of regular matroids, is
highly unlikely: Minimum Spanning Circuit parameterized by \ell is W[1]-hard on
binary matroids even when |T|=1. We also show a limit to how far our results
can be strengthened by considering a smaller parameter. More precisely, we
prove that Minimum Spanning Circuit parameterized by |T| is W[1]-hard even on
cographic matroids, a proper subclass of regular matroids.

 <dc:description>  Functional properties of neurons are strongly coupled with their morphology.
Changes in neuronal activity alter morphological characteristics of dendritic
spines. First step towards understanding the structure-function relationship is
to group spines into main spine classes reported in the literature. Shape
analysis of dendritic spines can help neuroscientists understand the underlying
relationships. Due to unavailability of reliable automated tools, this analysis
is currently performed manually which is a time-intensive and subjective task.
Several studies on spine shape classification have been reported in the
literature, however, there is an on-going debate on whether distinct spine
shape classes exist or whether spines should be modeled through a continuum of
shape variations. Another challenge is the subjectivity and bias that is
introduced due to the supervised nature of classification approaches. In this
paper, we aim to address these issues by presenting a clustering perspective.
In this context, clustering may serve both confirmation of known patterns and
discovery of new ones. We perform cluster analysis on two-photon microscopic
images of spines using morphological, shape, and appearance based features and
gain insights into the spine shape analysis problem. We use histogram of
oriented gradients (HOG), disjunctive normal shape models (DNSM), morphological
features, and intensity profile based features for cluster analysis. We use
x-means to perform cluster analysis that selects the number of clusters
automatically using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). For all features,
this analysis produces 4 clusters and we observe the formation of at least one
cluster consisting of spines which are difficult to be assigned to a known
class. This observation supports the argument of intermediate shape types.

 <dc:description>  Given a simple polygon $\mathcal{P}$ on $n$ vertices, two points $x,y$ in
$\mathcal{P}$ are said to be visible to each other if the line segment between
$x$ and $y$ is contained in $\mathcal{P}$. The Point Guard Art Gallery problem
asks for a minimum set $S$ such that every point in $\mathcal{P}$ is visible
from a point in $S$. The set $S$ is referred to as guards. Assuming integer
coordinates and a specific general position assumption, we present the first
$O(\log \text{OPT})$-approximation algorithm for the point guard problem for
simple polygons. This algorithm combines ideas of a paper of Efrat and
Har-Peled [Inf. Process. Lett. 2006] and Deshpande et. al. [WADS 2007]. We also
point out a mistake in the latter.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have seen more and more demand for a unified framework to
address multiple realistic image retrieval tasks concerning both category and
attributes. Considering the scale of modern datasets, hashing is favorable for
its low complexity. However, most existing hashing methods are designed to
preserve one single kind of similarity, thus improper for dealing with the
different tasks simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new
hashing method, named Dual Purpose Hashing (DPH), which jointly preserves the
category and attribute similarities by exploiting the Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) models to hierarchically capture the correlations between
category and attributes. Since images with both category and attribute labels
are scarce, our method is designed to take the abundant partially labelled
images on the Internet as training inputs. With such a framework, the binary
codes of new-coming images can be readily obtained by quantizing the network
outputs of a binary-like layer, and the attributes can be recovered from the
codes easily. Experiments on two large-scale datasets show that our dual
purpose hash codes can achieve comparable or even better performance than those
state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for each individual retrieval
task, while being more compact than the compared methods.

 <dc:description>  Query answering over probabilistic data is an important task but is generally
intractable. However, a new approach for this problem has recently been
proposed, based on structural decompositions of input databases, following,
e.g., tree decompositions. This paper presents a vision for a database

many theoretical and practical challenges that remain to be addressed.

 <dc:description>  Partial diffusion-based recursive least squares (PDRLS) is an effective
method for reducing computational load and power consumption in adaptive
network implementation. In this method, each node shares a part of its
intermediate estimate vector with its neighbors at each iteration. PDRLS
algorithm reduces the internode communications relative to the full-diffusion
RLS algorithm. This selection of estimate entries becomes more appealing when
the information fuse over noisy links. In this paper, we study the steady-state
performance of PDRLS algorithm in presence of noisy links and investigate its
convergence in both mean and mean-square senses. We also derive a theoretical
expression for its steady-state meansquare deviation (MSD). The simulation
results illustrate that the stability conditions for PDRLS under noisy links
are not sufficient to guarantee its convergence. Strictly speaking, considering
nonideal links condition adds a new complexity to the estimation problem for
which the PDRLS algorithm becomes unstable and do not converge for any value of
the forgetting factor.

 <dc:title>Exploiting Vagueness for Multi-Agent Consensus</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A framework for consensus modelling is introduced using Kleene's three valued
logic as a means to express vagueness in agents' beliefs. Explicitly borderline
cases are inherent to propositions involving vague concepts where sentences of
a propositional language may be absolutely true, absolutely false or
borderline. By exploiting these intermediate truth values, we can allow agents
to adopt a more vague interpretation of underlying concepts in order to weaken
their beliefs and reduce the levels of inconsistency, so as to achieve
consensus. We consider a consensus combination operation which results in
agents adopting the borderline truth value as a shared viewpoint if they are in
direct conflict. Simulation experiments are presented which show that applying
this operator to agents chosen at random (subject to a consistency threshold)
from a population, with initially diverse opinions, results in convergence to a
smaller set of more precise shared beliefs. Furthermore, if the choice of
agents for combination is dependent on the payoff of their beliefs, this acting
as a proxy for performance or usefulness, then the system converges to beliefs
which, on average, have higher payoff.

 <dc:description>  We propose a decentralized access control scheme for interference management
in D2D (device-to-device) underlaid cellular networks. Our method combines
SIR-aware link activation with cellular exclusion regions in a case where D2D
links opportunistically access the licensed cellular spectrum. Analytical
expressions and tight approximations for the coverage probabilities of cellular
and D2D links are derived. We characterize the impact of the guard zone radius
and the SIR threshold on the D2D area spectral efficiency and cellular
coverage. A tractable approach was proposed in order to find the SIR threshold
and guard zone radius, which maximize the area spectral efficiency of the D2D
communication while ensuring sufficient coverage probability for cellular
uplink users. Simulations validate the accuracy of our analytical results and
show the performance gain of our proposed scheme compared to existing
state-of-the-art solutions.

systems, energy flow in a water heater control system is not reversible. In
order to increase the eigen consumption of photovoltaic energy, i.e. direct
consumption of generated energy in the house, we propose to employ a dynamic
programming approach to optimize heating schedules using forecasted consumption
and weather data. Simulation results demonstrate the capability of our proposed
system in reducing the overall energy cost while maintaining residents'
comfort.

 <dc:description>  It has been proved that to implement a linearizable shared memory in
synchronous message-passing systems it is necessary to wait for a time
proportional to the uncertainty in the latency of the network for both read and
write operations, while waiting during read or during write operations is
sufficient for sequential consistency. This paper extends this result to
crash-prone asynchronous systems. We propose a distributed algorithm that
builds a sequentially consistent shared memory abstraction with snapshot on top
of an asynchronous message-passing system where less than half of the processes
may crash. We prove that it is only necessary to wait when a read/snapshot is
immediately preceded by a write on the same process. We also show that
sequential consistency is composable in some cases commonly encountered: 1)
objects that would be linearizable if they were implemented on top of a
linearizable memory become sequentially consistent when implemented on top of a
sequential memory while remaining composable and 2) in round-based algorithms,
where each object is only accessed within one round.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the complexity of distributed construction of purely
additive spanners in the CONGEST model. We describe algorithms for building
such spanners in several cases. Because of the need to simultaneously make
decisions at far apart locations, the algorithms use additional mechanisms
compared to their sequential counterparts.
  We complement our algorithms with a lower bound on the number of rounds
required for computing pairwise spanners. The standard reductions from
set-disjointness and equality seem unsuitable for this task because no specific
edge needs to be removed from the graph. Instead, to obtain our lower bound, we
define a new communication complexity problem that reduces to computing a
sparse spanner, and prove a lower bound on its communication complexity using
information theory. This technique significantly extends the current toolbox
used for obtaining lower bounds for the CONGEST model, and we believe it may
find additional applications.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the study of an event grouping based algorithm for a
university course timetabling problem. Several publications which discuss the
problem and some approaches for its solution are analyzed. The grouping of
events in groups with an equal number of events in each group is not applicable
to all input data sets. For this reason, a universal approach to all possible
groupings of events in commensurate in size groups is proposed here. Also, an
implementation of an algorithm based on this approach is presented. The
methodology, conditions and the objectives of the experiment are described. The
experimental results are analyzed and the ensuing conclusions are stated. The
future guidelines for further research are formulated.

 <dc:title>Wireless Information and Power Transfer: Nonlinearity, Waveform Design
  and Rate-Energy Tradeoff</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Clerckx, Bruno</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The design of Wireless Information and Power Transfer (WIPT) has so far
relied on an oversimplified and inaccurate linear model of the energy
harvester. In this paper, we depart from this linear model and design WIPT
considering the rectifier nonlinearity. We develop a tractable model of the
rectifier nonlinearity that is flexible enough to cope with general
multicarrier modulated input waveforms. Leveraging that model, we motivate and
introduce a novel WIPT architecture relying on the superposition of
multi-carrier unmodulated and modulated waveforms at the transmitter. The
superposed WIPT waveforms are optimized as a function of the channel state
information so as to characterize the rate-energy region of the whole system.
Analysis and numerical results illustrate the performance of the derived
waveforms and WIPT architecture and highlight that nonlinearity radically
changes the design of WIPT. We make key and refreshing observations. First,
analysis (confirmed by circuit simulations) shows that modulated and
unmodulated waveforms are not equally suitable for wireless power delivery,
namely modulation being beneficial in single-carrier transmissions but
detrimental in multi-carrier transmissions. Second, a multicarrier unmodulated
waveform (superposed to a multi-carrier modulated waveform) is useful to
enlarge the rate-energy region of WIPT. Third, a combination of power splitting
and time sharing is in general the best strategy. Fourth, a non-zero mean
Gaussian input distribution outperforms the conventional capacity-achieving
zero-mean Gaussian input distribution in multi-carrier transmissions. Fifth,
the rectifier nonlinearity is beneficial to system performance and is essential
to efficient WIPT design.

 <dc:description>  Science is a growing system, exhibiting ~4% annual growth in publications and
~1.8% annual growth in the number of references per publication. Combined these
trends correspond to a 12-year doubling period in the total supply of
references, thereby challenging traditional methods of evaluating scientific
production, from researchers to institutions. Against this background, we
analyzed a citation network comprised of 837 million references produced by
32.6 million publications over the period 1965-2012, allowing for a temporal
analysis of the `attention economy' in science. Unlike previous studies, we
analyzed the entire probability distribution of reference ages - the time
difference between a citing and cited paper - thereby capturing previously
overlooked trends. Over this half-century period we observe a narrowing range
of attention - both classic and recent literature are being cited increasingly
less, pointing to the important role of socio-technical processes. To better
understand the impact of exponential growth on the underlying knowledge network
we develop a network-based model, featuring the redirection of scientific
attention via publications' reference lists, and validate the model against
several empirical benchmarks. We then use the model to test the causal impact
of real paradigm shifts, thereby providing guidance for science policy
analysis. In particular, we show how perturbations to the growth rate of
scientific output affects the reference age distribution and the functionality
of the vast science citation network as an aid for the search &amp; retrieval of
knowledge. In order to account for the inflation of science, our study points
to the need for a systemic overhaul of the counting methods used to evaluate
citation impact - especially in the case of evaluating science careers, which
can span several decades and thus several doubling periods.

 <dc:description>  Aliasing is a known source of challenges in the context of imperative
object-oriented languages, which have led to important advances in type systems
for aliasing control. However, their large-scale adoption has turned out to be
a surprisingly difficult challenge. While new language designs show promise,
they do not address the need of aliasing control in existing languages.
  This paper presents a new approach to isolation and uniqueness in an
existing, widely-used language, Scala. The approach is unique in the way it
addresses some of the most important obstacles to the adoption of type system
extensions for aliasing control. First, adaptation of existing code requires
only a minimal set of annotations. Only a single bit of information is required
per class. Surprisingly, the paper shows that this information can be provided
by the object-capability discipline, widely-used in program security. We
formalize our approach as a type system and prove key soundness theorems. The
type system is implemented for the full Scala language, providing, for the
first time, a sound integration with Scala's local type inference. Finally, we
empirically evaluate the conformity of existing Scala open-source code on a
corpus of over 75,000 LOC.

 <dc:title>A Local-Global Approach to Semantic Segmentation in Aerial Images</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Marcu, Alina Elena</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Aerial images are often taken under poor lighting conditions and contain low
resolution objects, many times occluded by other objects. In this domain,
visual context could be of great help, but there are still very few papers that
consider context in aerial image understanding and still remains an open
problem in computer vision. We propose a dual-stream deep neural network that
processes information along two independent pathways. Our model learns to
combine local and global appearance in a complementary way, such that together
form a powerful classifier. We test our dual-stream network on the task of
buildings segmentation in aerial images and obtain state-of-the-art results on
the Massachusetts Buildings Dataset. We study the relative importance of local
appearance versus the larger scene, as well as their performance in combination
on three new buildings datasets. We clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of
visual context in conjunction with deep neural networks for aerial image
understanding.

 <dc:description>  We present a new streaming algorithm for the $k$-Mismatch problem, one of the
most basic problems in pattern matching. Given a pattern and a text, the task
is to find all substrings of the text that are at the Hamming distance at most
$k$ from the pattern. Our algorithm is enhanced with an important new feature
called Error Correcting, and its complexities for $k=1$ and for a general $k$
match those of the best known solutions for the $k$-Mismatch problem from FOCS
2009 and SODA 2016. As a corollary we develop a series of streaming algorithms
for pattern matching on weighted strings, which are a commonly used
representation of uncertain sequences in molecular biology.

 <dc:description>  A natural way to measure the power of a distributed-computing model is to
characterize the set of tasks that can be solved in it. %the model. In general,
however, the question of whether a given task can be solved in a given model is
undecidable, even if we only consider the wait-free shared-memory model.
  In this paper, we address this question for restricted classes of models and
tasks. We show that the question of whether a collection $C$ of
\emph{$(\ell,j)$-set consensus} objects, for various $\ell$ (the number of
processes that can invoke the object) and $j$ (the number of distinct outputs
the object returns), can be used by $n$ processes to solve wait-free $k$-set
consensus is decidable. Moreover, we provide a simple $O(n^2)$ decision
algorithm, based on a dynamic programming solution to the Knapsack optimization
problem.
  We then present an \emph{adaptive} wait-free set-consensus algorithm that,
for each set of participating processes, achieves the best level of agreement
that is possible to achieve using $C$. Overall, this gives us a complete
characterization of a read-write model defined by a collection of set-consensus
objects through its \emph{set-consensus power}.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of gossip in dynamic networks controlled by an adversary
that can modify the network arbitrarily from one round to another, provided
that the network is always connected. In the gossip problem, $n$ tokens are
arbitrarily distributed among the $n$ network nodes, and the goal is to
disseminate all the $n$ tokens to every node. Our focus is on token-forwarding
algorithms, which do not manipulate tokens in any way other than storing,
copying, and forwarding them. Gossip can be completed in linear time in any
static network, but a basic open question for dynamic networks is the existence
of a distributed protocol that can do significantly better than an easily
achievable bound of $O(n^2)$ rounds.
  In previous work, it has been shown that under adaptive adversaries, every
token forwarding algorithm requires $\Omega(n^2/\log n)$ rounds. In this paper,
we study oblivious adversaries, which differ from adaptive adversaries in one
crucial aspect--- they are oblivious to random choices made by the protocol. We
present an $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{3/2})$ lower bound under an oblivious adversary
for RANDDIFF, a natural algorithm in which neighbors exchange a token chosen
uniformly at random from the difference of their token sets. We also present an
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^{4/3})$ bound under a stronger notion of oblivious adversary
for symmetric knowledge-based algorithms. On the positive side, we present a
centralized algorithm that completes gossip in $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ rounds. We
also show an $\tilde{O}(n^{5/3})$ upper bound for RANDDIFF in a restricted
class of oblivious adversaries, which we call paths-respecting.

 <dc:title>Design of LDPC Codes using Multipath EMD Strategies and Progressive Edge
  Growth</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Healy, C. T.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>de Lamare, R. C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are capable of achieving excellent
performance and provide a useful alternative for high performance applications.
However, at medium to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), an observable error
floor arises from the loss of independence of messages passed under iterative
graph-based decoding. In this paper, the error floor performance of short block
length codes is improved by use of a novel candidate selection metric in code
graph construction. The proposed Multipath EMD approach avoids harmful
structures in the graph by evaluating certain properties of the cycles which
may be introduced in each edge placement. We present Multipath EMD based
designs for several structured LDPC codes including quasi-cyclic and irregular
repeat accumulate codes. In addition, an extended class of diversity-achieving
codes on the challenging block fading channel is proposed and considered with
the Multipath EMD design. This combined approach is demonstrated to provide
gains in decoder convergence and error rate performance. A simulation study
evaluates the performance of the proposed and existing state-of-the-art
methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the possibility of eliminating the redundant cyclic prefix
(CP) of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in massive
multiple-input multiple-output systems. The absence of CP increases the
bandwidth efficiency in expense of intersymbol interference (ISI) and
intercarrier interference (ICI). It is known that in massive MIMO, different
types of interference fade away as the number of base station (BS) antennas
tends to infinity. In this paper, we investigate if the channel distortions in
the absence of CP are averaged out in the large antenna regime. To this end, we
analytically study the performance of the conventional maximum ratio combining
(MRC) and realize that there always remains some residual interference leading
to saturation of signal to interference (SIR). This saturation of SIR is
quantified through mathematical equations. Moreover, to resolve the saturation
problem, we propose a technique based on time-reversal MRC with zero forcing
multiuser detection (TR-ZF). Thus, the SIR of our proposed TR-ZF does not
saturate and is a linear function of the number of BS antennas. We also show
that TR-ZF only needs one OFDM demodulator per user irrespective of the number
of BS antennas; reducing the BS signal processing complexity significantly.
Finally, we corroborate our claims as well as analytical results through
simulations.

 <dc:description>  BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) is a new wireless communication technology that,
thanks to reduced power consumption, promises to facilitate communication
between computing devices and help us harness their power in environments and
contexts previously untouched by information technology. Museums and other
facilities housing various cultural content are a particularly interesting area
of application. The University of Cambridge Museums consortium has put
considerable effort into researching the potential uses of emerging
technologies such as BLE to unlock new experiences enriching the way we engage
with cultural information. As a part of this research initiative, our ambition
has been to examine the challenges and opportunities introduced by the
introduction of a BLE-centred system into the museum context. We present an
assessment of the potential offered by this technology and of the design
approaches that might yield the best results when developing BLE-centred
experiences for museum environments. A pivotal part of our project consisted of
designing, developing and evaluating a prototype mobile location-based
BLE-centred game. A number of technical problems, such as unstable and
fluctuating signal strength, were encountered throughout the project lifecycle.
Instead of attempting to eliminate such problems, we argued in favour of
embracing them and turning them into a cornerstone of the gameplay. Our study
suggested that this alternative seamful design approach yields particularly
good results when deploying the technology in public environments. The project
outcome also demonstrated the potential of BLE-centred solutions to reach out
and engage new demographics, especially children, extending their interest in
museum visits.

 <dc:description>  Robust and far-field speech recognition is critical to enable true hands-free
communication. In far-field conditions, signals are attenuated due to distance.
To improve robustness to loudness variation, we introduce a novel frontend
called per-channel energy normalization (PCEN). The key ingredient of PCEN is
the use of an automatic gain control based dynamic compression to replace the
widely used static (such as log or root) compression. We evaluate PCEN on the
keyword spotting task. On our large rerecorded noisy and far-field eval sets,
we show that PCEN significantly improves recognition performance. Furthermore,
we model PCEN as neural network layers and optimize high-dimensional PCEN
parameters jointly with the keyword spotting acoustic model. The trained PCEN
frontend demonstrates significant further improvements without increasing model
complexity or inference-time cost.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic timed games (STGs), introduced by Bouyer and Forejt, naturally
generalize both continuous-time Markov chains and timed automata by providing a
partition of the locations between those controlled by two players (Player Box
and Player Diamond) with competing objectives and those governed by stochastic
laws. Depending on the number of players---$2$, $1$, or $0$---subclasses of
stochastic timed games are often classified as $2\frac{1}{2}$-player,
$1\frac{1}{2}$-player, and $\frac{1}{2}$-player games where the $\frac{1}{2}$
symbolizes the presence of the stochastic &quot;nature&quot; player. For STGs with
reachability objectives it is known that $1\frac{1}{2}$-player one-clock STGs
are decidable for qualitative objectives, and that $2\frac{1}{2}$-player
three-clock STGs are undecidable for quantitative reachability objectives. This
paper further refines the gap in this decidability spectrum. We show that
quantitative reachability objectives are already undecidable for $1\frac{1}{2}$
player four-clock STGs, and even under the time-bounded restriction for
$2\frac{1}{2}$-player five-clock STGs. We also obtain a class of
$1\frac{1}{2}$, $2\frac{1}{2}$ player STGs for which the quantitative
reachability problem is decidable.

 <dc:title>Stochastic Backpropagation through Mixture Density Distributions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Graves, Alex</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The ability to backpropagate stochastic gradients through continuous latent
distributions has been crucial to the emergence of variational autoencoders and
stochastic gradient variational Bayes. The key ingredient is an unbiased and
low-variance way of estimating gradients with respect to distribution
parameters from gradients evaluated at distribution samples. The
&quot;reparameterization trick&quot; provides a class of transforms yielding such
estimators for many continuous distributions, including the Gaussian and other
members of the location-scale family. However the trick does not readily extend
to mixture density models, due to the difficulty of reparameterizing the
discrete distribution over mixture weights. This report describes an
alternative transform, applicable to any continuous multivariate distribution
with a differentiable density function from which samples can be drawn, and
uses it to derive an unbiased estimator for mixture density weight derivatives.
Combined with the reparameterization trick applied to the individual mixture
components, this estimator makes it straightforward to train variational
autoencoders with mixture-distributed latent variables, or to perform
stochastic variational inference with a mixture density variational posterior.

sigmoid cross-entropy loss (logistic regression). Our method consists in
embedding high-dimensional sparse labels onto a lower-dimensional dense sphere
of unit-normed vectors, and treating the classification problem as a cosine
proximity regression problem on this sphere. We test our method on a dataset of
300 million high-resolution images with 17,000 labels, where it yields
considerably faster convergence, as well as a 7% higher mean average precision
compared to logistic regression.

 <dc:title>FusionNet: 3D Object Classification Using Multiple Data Representations</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  High-quality 3D object recognition is an important component of many vision
and robotics systems. We tackle the object recognition problem using two data
representations, to achieve leading results on the Princeton ModelNet
challenge. The two representations: 1. Volumetric representation: the 3D object
is discretized spatially as binary voxels - $1$ if the voxel is occupied and
$0$ otherwise. 2. Pixel representation: the 3D object is represented as a set
of projected 2D pixel images. Current leading submissions to the ModelNet
Challenge use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on pixel representations.
However, we diverge from this trend and additionally, use Volumetric CNNs to
bridge the gap between the efficiency of the above two representations. We
combine both representations and exploit them to learn new features, which
yield a significantly better classifier than using either of the
representations in isolation. To do this, we introduce new Volumetric CNN
(V-CNN) architectures.

 <dc:title>How to Discreetly Spread a Rumor in a Crowd</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study PUSH-PULL style rumor spreading algorithms in the
mobile telephone model, a variant of the classical telephone model in which
each node can participate in at most one connection per round; i.e., you can no
longer have multiple nodes pull information from the same source in a single
round. Our model also includes two new parameterized generalizations: (1) the
network topology can undergo a bounded rate of change (for a parameterized rate
that spans from no changes to changes in every round); and (2) in each round,
each node can advertise a bounded amount of information to all of its neighbors
before connection decisions are made (for a parameterized number of bits that
spans from no advertisement to large advertisements). We prove that in the
mobile telephone model with no advertisements and no topology changes,
PUSH-PULL style algorithms perform poorly with respect to a graph's vertex
expansion and graph conductance as compared to the known tight results in the
classical telephone model. We then prove, however, that if nodes are allowed to
advertise a single bit in each round, a natural variation of PUSH-PULL
terminates in time that matches (within logarithmic factors) this strategy's
performance in the classical telephone model---even in the presence of frequent
topology changes. We also analyze how the performance of this algorithm
degrades as the rate of change increases toward the maximum possible amount. We
argue that our model matches well the properties of emerging peer-to-peer
communication standards for mobile devices, and that our efficient PUSH-PULL
variation that leverages small advertisements and adapts well to topology
changes is a good choice for rumor spreading in this increasingly important
setting.

 <dc:title>Stochastic Epidemic Networks with Strategic Link Formation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Xu, Jie</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Understanding cascading failures or epidemics in networks is crucial for
developing effective defensive mechanisms for many critical systems and
infrastructures (e.g. biological, social and cyber networks). Most of the
existing works treat the network topology as being exogenously given and study
under what conditions an epidemic breaks out and/or extinguishes. However, if
agents are able to strategically decide their connections according to their
own self-interest, the network will instead be endogenously formed and
evolving. In such systems, the epidemic, agents' strategic decisions and the
network structure become complexly coupled and co-evolve. As a result, existing
knowledge may no longer be applicable. Built on a continuous time
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible epidemic model with strong mixing, this paper
studies stochastic epidemic networks consisting of strategic agents, who decide
the number of links to form based on a careful evaluation of its current
obtainable benefit and the potential future cost due to infection by forming
links. A game theoretical framework is developed to analyze such networks and a
number of important insights are obtained. One key result is that whereas an
epidemic eventually dies out if the effective spreading rate is sufficiently
low in exogenously given networks, it never dies out when agents are strategic
regardless of the effective spreading rate. This property leads to reduced
achievable system efficiency and considerably different optimal protection
mechanisms. Without understanding the strategic behavior of agents, significant
security cost may incur.

probabilistic uncertain information. Data is modeled by possible-worlds with
probability distribution, compactly represented in the probabilistic relation
model. Integration is achieved efficiently using the extended probabilistic
relation model. We study the problem of determining the probability
distribution of the integration result. It has been shown that, in general,
only probability ranges can be determined for the result of integration. In
this paper we concentrate on a subclass of extended probabilistic relations,
those that are obtainable through integration. We show that under intuitive and
reasonable assumptions we can determine the exact probability distribution of
the result of integration.

 <dc:description>  Field Programmable Gate Arrays(FPGA) exceed the computing power of software
based implementations by breaking the paradigm of sequential execution and
accomplishing more per clock cycle by enabling hardware level parallelization
at an architectural level. Introducing parallel architectures for a
computationally intensive algorithm like Rapidly Exploring Random Trees(RRT)
will result in an exploration that is fast, dense and uniform. Through a cost
function delineated in later sections, FPGA based combinatorial architecture
delivers superlative speed-up but consumes very high power while hierarchical
architecture delivers relatively lower speed-up with acceptable power
consumption levels. To combine the qualities of both, a hybrid architecture,
that encompasses both combinatorial and hierarchical architecture, is designed.
To determine the number of RRT nodes to be allotted to the combinatorial and
hierarchical blocks of the hybrid architecture, a cost function, comprised of
fundamentally inversely related speed-up and power parameters, is formulated.
This maximization of cost function, with its associated constraints,is then
mathematically solved using a modified branch and bound, that leads to optimal
allocation of RRT modules to both blocks. It is observed that this hybrid
architecture delivers the highest performance-per-watt out of the three
architectures for differential, quad-copter and fixed wing kinematics.

 <dc:description>  We are interested in the numerical solution of large systems of hyperbolic
conservation laws or systems in which the characteristic decomposition is
expensive to compute. Solving such equations using finite volumes or
Discontinuous Galerkin requires a numerical flux function which solves local
Riemann problems at cell interfaces. There are various methods to express the
numerical flux function. On the one end, there is the robust but very diffusive
Lax-Friedrichs solver; on the other end the upwind Godunov solver which
respects all resulting waves. The drawback of the latter method is the costly
computation of the eigensystem.
  This work presents a family of simple first order Riemann solvers, named
HLLX$\omega$, which avoid solving the eigensystem. The new method reproduces
all waves of the system with less dissipation than other solvers with similar
input and effort, such as HLL and FORCE. The family of Riemann solvers can be
seen as an extension or generalization of the methods introduced by Degond et
al. \cite{DegondPeyrardRussoVilledieu1999}. We only require the same number of
input values as HLL, namely the globally fastest wave speeds in both
directions, or an estimate of the speeds. Thus, the new family of Riemann
solvers is particularly efficient for large systems of conservation laws when
the spectral decomposition is expensive to compute or no explicit expression
for the eigensystem is available.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the problem of determining if a given graph corresponds to the
dual of a triangulation of a simple polygon. This is a graph recognition
problem, where in our particular case we wish to recognize a graph which
corresponds to the dual of a triangulation of a simple polygon with or without
holes and interior points. We show that the difficulty of this problem depends
critically on the amount of information given and we give a sharp boundary
between the various tractable and intractable versions of the problem.

 <dc:title>Bayesian Non-Exhaustive Classification A Case Study: Online Name
  Disambiguation using Temporal Record Streams</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The name entity disambiguation task aims to partition the records of multiple
real-life persons so that each partition contains records pertaining to a
unique person. Most of the existing solutions for this task operate in a batch
mode, where all records to be disambiguated are initially available to the
algorithm. However, more realistic settings require that the name
disambiguation task be performed in an online fashion, in addition to, being
able to identify records of new ambiguous entities having no preexisting
records. In this work, we propose a Bayesian non-exhaustive classification
framework for solving online name disambiguation task. Our proposed method uses
a Dirichlet process prior with a Normal * Normal * Inverse Wishart data model
which enables identification of new ambiguous entities who have no records in
the training data. For online classification, we use one sweep Gibbs sampler
which is very efficient and effective. As a case study we consider
bibliographic data in a temporal stream format and disambiguate authors by
partitioning their papers into homogeneous groups. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method is better than existing methods for
performing online name disambiguation task.

 <dc:title>PRIIME: A Generic Framework for Interactive Personalized Interesting
  Pattern Discovery</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bhuiyan, Mansurul</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Hasan, Mohammad Al</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The traditional frequent pattern mining algorithms generate an exponentially
large number of patterns of which a substantial proportion are not much
significant for many data analysis endeavors. Discovery of a small number of
personalized interesting patterns from the large output set according to a
particular user's interest is an important as well as challenging task.
Existing works on pattern summarization do not solve this problem from the
personalization viewpoint. In this work, we propose an interactive pattern
discovery framework named PRIIME which identifies a set of interesting patterns
for a specific user without requiring any prior input on the interestingness
measure of patterns from the user. The proposed framework is generic to support
discovery of the interesting set, sequence and graph type patterns. We develop
a softmax classification based iterative learning algorithm that uses a limited
number of interactive feedback from the user to learn her interestingness
profile, and use this profile for pattern recommendation. To handle sequence
and graph type patterns PRIIME adopts a neural net (NN) based unsupervised
feature construction approach. We also develop a strategy that combines
exploration and exploitation to select patterns for feedback. We show
experimental results on several real-life datasets to validate the performance
of the proposed method. We also compare with the existing methods of
interactive pattern discovery to show that our method is substantially superior
in performance. To portray the applicability of the framework, we present a
case study from the real-estate domain.

 <dc:description>  One of the most important problems in audio event detection research is
absence of benchmark results for comparison with any proposed method. Different
works consider different sets of events and datasets which makes it difficult
to comprehensively analyze any novel method with an existing one. In this paper
we propose to establish results for audio event recognition on two recent
publicly-available datasets. In particular we use Gaussian Mixture model based
feature representation and combine them with linear as well as non-linear
kernel Support Vector Machines.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a new approach of spatially supervised recurrent
convolutional neural networks for visual object tracking. Our recurrent
convolutional network exploits the history of locations as well as the
distinctive visual features learned by the deep neural networks. Inspired by
recent bounding box regression methods for object detection, we study the
regression capability of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in the temporal domain,
and propose to concatenate high-level visual features produced by convolutional
networks with region information. In contrast to existing deep learning based
trackers that use binary classification for region candidates, we use
regression for direct prediction of the tracking locations both at the
convolutional layer and at the recurrent unit. Our extensive experimental
results and performance comparison with state-of-the-art tracking methods on
challenging benchmark video tracking datasets shows that our tracker is more
accurate and robust while maintaining low computational cost. For most test
video sequences, our method achieves the best tracking performance, often
outperforms the second best by a large margin.

 <dc:description>  Property testers form an important class of sublinear algorithms. In the
standard property testing model, an algorithm accesses the input function via
an oracle that returns function values at all queried domain points. In many
realistic situations, the oracle may be unable to reveal the function values at
some domain points due to privacy concerns, or when some of the values get
erased by mistake or by an adversary.
  We initiate a study of property testers that are resilient to the presence of
adversarially erased function values. An alpha-erasure-resilient epsilon-tester
for a property P is given parameters alpha, epsilon in (0,1), along with oracle
access to a function f such that at most an alpha fraction of the function
values have been erased. The tester does not know whether a point is erased
unless it queries that point. The tester has to accept with high probability if
there is a way to assign values to the erased points such that the resulting
function satisfies P. It has to reject with high probability if, for all
assignments of values to the erased points, the resulting function has to be
changed in at least an epsilon-fraction of the nonerased domain points to
satisfy P.
  We design erasure-resilient property testers for a large class of properties.
For some properties, it is possible to obtain erasure-resilient testers by
using standard testers as a black box. But there are more challenging
properties for which all known testers rely on querying a specific point. If
this point is erased, all these testers break. We give efficient
erasure-resilient testers for several classes of such properties including
monotonicity, the Lipschitz property, and convexity. Finally, we describe a
property that can be epsilon-tested with O(1/epsilon) queries in the standard
model, whereas testing it in the erasure-resilient model requires number of
queries polynomial in the input size.

 <dc:title>Minimizing Uncertainty through Sensor Placement with Angle Constraints</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of sensor placement in environments in which
localization is a necessity, such as ad-hoc wireless sensor networks that allow
the placement of a few anchors that know their location or sensor arrays that
are tracking a target. In most of these situations, the quality of localization
depends on the relative angle between the target and the pair of sensors
observing it. In this paper, we consider placing a small number of sensors
which ensure good angular $\alpha$-coverage: given $\alpha$ in $[0,\pi/2]$, for
each target location $t$, there must be at least two sensors $s_1$ and $s_2$
such that the $\angle(s_1 t s_2)$ is in the interval $[\alpha, \pi-\alpha]$.
One of the main difficulties encountered in such problems is that since the
constraints depend on at least two sensors, building a solution must account
for the inherent dependency between selected sensors, a feature that generic
Set Cover techniques do not account for. We introduce a general framework that
guarantees an angular coverage that is arbitrarily close to $\alpha$ for any
$\alpha &lt;= \pi/3$ and apply it to a variety of problems to get bi-criteria
approximations. When the angular coverage is required to be at least a constant
fraction of $\alpha$, we obtain results that are strictly better than what
standard geometric Set Cover methods give. When the angular coverage is
required to be at least $(1-1/\delta)\cdot\alpha$, we obtain a
$\mathcal{O}(\log \delta)$- approximation for sensor placement with
$\alpha$-coverage on the plane. In the presence of additional distance or
visibility constraints, the framework gives a $\mathcal{O}(\log\delta\cdot\log
k_{OPT})$-approximation, where $k_{OPT}$ is the size of the optimal solution.
We also use our framework to give a $\mathcal{O}(\log \delta)$-approximation
that ensures $(1-1/\delta)\cdot \alpha$-coverage and covers every target within
distance $3R$.

 <dc:description>  Micro-blogging services can track users' geo-locations when users check-in
their places or use geo-tagging which implicitly reveals locations. This &quot;geo
tracking&quot; can help to find topics triggered by some events in certain regions.
However, discovering such topics is very challenging because of the large
amount of noisy messages (e.g. daily conversations). This paper proposes a
method to model geographical topics, which can filter out irrelevant words by
different weights in the local and global contexts. Our method is based on the
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model but each word is generated from either
a local or a global topic distribution by its generation probabilities. We
evaluated our model with data collected from Weibo, which is currently the most
popular micro-blogging service for Chinese. The evaluation results demonstrate
that our method outperforms other baseline methods in several metrics such as
model perplexity, two kinds of entropies and KL-divergence of discovered
topics.

 <dc:description>  The growing needs for high-quality video applications have resulted in a lot
of studies and developments in video signal coding. This chapter presents some
advanced techniques in enhancing the rate-distortion performance of the
block-based hybrid video coding systems. Additionally, as can be seen from the
developments of H.264/AVC and HEVC, most of the current coding tools, such as
prediction, transformation and entropy coding, have less room to improve in the
compression performance. On the other hand, loop filer in the modern video
standards shows the promising results. Thus, we believe that loop filter can be
the candidate in contributing to higher video compression for the
next-generation video coding. Specifically, improvements on ALF and SAO are
also introduced, and the simulation results show that the proposed methods
outperform the existing method, which offer new degrees of freedom to improve
the overall rate-distortion performance. As a result, they can be the candidate
coding tools for the next-generation video codec.

\textit{&quot;I don't know&quot;} to questions. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end
approach to avoid such problem in neural generative models. Additional memory
mechanisms have been introduced to standard sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)
models, so that context can be considered while generating sentences. Three
seq2seq models, which memorize a fix-sized contextual vector from hidden input,
hidden input/output and a gated contextual attention structure respectively,
have been trained and tested on a dataset of labeled question-answering pairs
in Chinese. The model with contextual attention outperforms others including
the state-of-the-art seq2seq models on perplexity test. The novel contextual
model generates diverse and robust responses, and is able to carry out
conversations on a wide range of topics appropriately.

 <dc:description>  We are at the dawn of a new era, where advances in computer power, broadband
communication and digital sensor technologies have led to an unprecedented
flood of data inundating our surrounding. It is generally believed that means
such as Computational Intelligence will help to outlive these tough times.
However, these hopes are improperly high. Computational Intelligence is a
surprising composition of two mutually exclusive and contradicting constituents
that could be coupled only if you disregard and neglect their controversies:
&quot;Computational&quot; implies reliance on data processing and &quot;Intelligence&quot; implies
reliance on information processing. Only those who are indifferent to
data-information discrepancy can believe that such a combination can be viable.
We do not believe in miracles, so we will try to share with you our
reservations.

 <dc:description>  During medicine studies, visualization of certain elements is common and
indispensable in order to get more information about the way they work.
Currently, we resort to the use of photographs -which are insufficient due to
being static- or tests in patients, which can be invasive or even risky.
Therefore, a low-cost approach is proposed by using a 3D visualization. This
paper presents a holographic system built with low-cost materials for teaching
obstetrics, where student interaction is performed by using voice and gestures.
Our solution, which we called HoloMed, is focused on the projection of a
euthocic normal delivery under a web-based infrastructure which also employs a
Kinect. HoloMed is divided in three (3) essential modules: a gesture analyzer,
a data server, and a holographic projection architecture, which can be executed
in several interconnected computers using different network protocols. Tests
used for determining the user's position, illumination factors, and response
times, demonstrate HoloMed's effectiveness as a low-cost system for teaching,
using a natural user interface and 3D images.

 <dc:description>  A spanning tree of a graph $G$ is a connected acyclic spanning subgraph of
$G$. We consider enumeration of spanning trees when $G$ is a $2$-tree, meaning
that $G$ is obtained from one edge by iteratively adding a vertex whose
neighborhood consists of two adjacent vertices. We use this construction order
both to inductively list the spanning trees without repetition and to give
bounds on the number of them. We determine the $n$-vertex $2$-trees having the
most and the fewest spanning trees. The $2$-tree with the fewest is unique; it
has $n-2$ vertices of degree $2$ and has $n2^{n-3}$ spanning trees. Those with
the most are all those having exactly two vertices of degree $2$, and their
number of spanning trees is the Fibonacci number $F_{2n-2}$.

 <dc:description>  Advances in topic modeling have yielded effective methods for characterizing
the latent semantics of textual data. However, applying standard topic modeling
approaches to sentence-level tasks introduces a number of challenges. In this
paper, we adapt the approach of latent-Dirichlet allocation to include an
additional layer for incorporating information about the sentence boundaries in
documents. We show that the addition of this minimal information of document
structure improves the perplexity results of a trained model.

 <dc:title>The Status of Polycyclic Group-Based Cryptography: A Survey and Open
  Problems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Polycyclic groups are natural generalizations of cyclic groups but with more
complicated algorithmic properties. They are finitely presented and the word,
conjugacy, and isomorphism decision problems are all solvable in these groups.
Moreover, the non-virtually nilpotent ones exhibit an exponential growth rate.
These properties make them suitable for use in group-based cryptography, which
was proposed in 2004 by Eick and Kahrobaei. Since then, many cryptosystems have
been created that employ polycyclic groups. These include key exchanges such as
non-commutative ElGamal, authentication schemes based on the twisted conjugacy
problem, and secret sharing via the word problem. In response, heuristic and
deterministic methods of cryptanalysis have been developed, including the
length-based and linear decomposition attacks. Despite these efforts, there are
classes of infinite polycyclic groups that remain suitable for cryptography.
The analysis of algorithms for search and decision problems in polycyclic
groups has also been developed. In addition to results for the aforementioned
problems we present those concerning polycyclic representations, group
morphisms, and orbit decidability. Though much progress has been made, many
algorithmic and complexity problems remain unsolved, we conclude with a number
of them. Of particular interest is to show that cryptosystems using infinite
polycyclic groups are resistant to cryptanalysis on a quantum computer.

 <dc:title>Incremental Learning for Fully Unsupervised Word Segmentation Using
  Penalized Likelihood and Model Selection</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Ruey-Cheng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a novel incremental learning approach for unsupervised word
segmentation that combines features from probabilistic modeling and model
selection. This includes super-additive penalties for addressing the cognitive
burden imposed by long word formation, and new model selection criteria based
on higher-order generative assumptions. Our approach is fully unsupervised; it
relies on a small number of parameters that permits flexible modeling and a
mechanism that automatically learns parameters from the data. Through
experimentation, we show that this intricate design has led to top-tier
performance in both phonemic and orthographic word segmentation.

 <dc:title>On the Geodesic Centers of Polygonal Domains</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Haitao</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the problem of computing Euclidean geodesic centers
of a polygonal domain $\mathcal{P}$ with a total of $n$ vertices. We discover
many interesting observations. We give a necessary condition for a point being
a geodesic center. We show that there is at most one geodesic center among all
points of $\mathcal{P}$ that have topologically-equivalent shortest path maps.
This implies that the total number of geodesic centers is bounded by the
combinatorial size of the shortest path map equivalence decomposition of
$\mathcal{P}$, which is known to be $O(n^{10})$. One key observation is a
$\pi$-range property on shortest path lengths when points are moving. With
these observations, we propose an algorithm that computes all geodesic centers
in $O(n^{11}\log n)$ time. Previously, an algorithm of $O(n^{12+\epsilon})$
time was known for this problem, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$.

 <dc:description>  ProbNetKAT is a probabilistic extension of NetKAT with a denotational
semantics based on Markov kernels. The language is expressive enough to
generate continuous distributions, which raises the question of how to compute
effectively in the language. This paper gives an new characterization of
ProbNetKAT's semantics using domain theory, which provides the foundation
needed to build a practical implementation. We show how to use the semantics to
approximate the behavior of arbitrary ProbNetKAT programs using distributions
with finite support. We develop a prototype implementation and show how to use
it to solve a variety of problems including characterizing the expected
congestion induced by different routing schemes and reasoning probabilistically
about reachability in a network.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Despite significant recent progress, the best available computer vision
algorithms still lag far behind human capabilities, even for recognizing
individual discrete objects under various poses, illuminations, and
backgrounds. Here we present a new approach to using object pose information to
improve deep network learning. While existing large-scale datasets, e.g.
ImageNet, do not have pose information, we leverage the newly published
turntable dataset, iLab-20M, which has ~22M images of 704 object instances shot
under different lightings, camera viewpoints and turntable rotations, to do
more controlled object recognition experiments. We introduce a new
convolutional neural network architecture, what/where CNN (2W-CNN), built on a
linear-chain feedforward CNN (e.g., AlexNet), augmented by hierarchical layers
regularized by object poses. Pose information is only used as feedback signal
during training, in addition to category information; during test, the
feedforward network only predicts category. To validate the approach, we train
both 2W-CNN and AlexNet using a fraction of the dataset, and 2W-CNN achieves 6%
performance improvement in category prediction. We show mathematically that
2W-CNN has inherent advantages over AlexNet under the stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) optimization procedure. Further more, we fine-tune object
recognition on ImageNet by using the pretrained 2W-CNN and AlexNet features on
iLab-20M, results show that significant improvements have been achieved,
compared with training AlexNet from scratch. Moreover, fine-tuning 2W-CNN
features performs even better than fine-tuning the pretrained AlexNet features.
These results show pretrained features on iLab- 20M generalizes well to natural
image datasets, and 2WCNN learns even better features for object recognition
than AlexNet.

the twisted centralizer code $C_F(A,\lambda):=\{B\in F^{n\times n}\mid

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a two-view deterministic geometric model fitting method,
termed Superpixel-based Deterministic Fitting (SDF), for multiple-structure
data. SDF starts from superpixel segmentation, which effectively captures prior
information of feature appearances. The feature appearances are beneficial to
reduce the computational complexity for deterministic fitting methods. SDF also
includes two original elements, i.e., a deterministic sampling algorithm and a
novel model selection algorithm. The two algorithms are tightly coupled to
boost the performance of SDF in both speed and accuracy. Specifically, the
proposed sampling algorithm leverages the grouping cues of superpixels to
generate reliable and consistent hypotheses. The proposed model selection
algorithm further makes use of desirable properties of the generated
hypotheses, to improve the conventional fit-and-remove framework for more
efficient and effective performance. The key characteristic of SDF is that it
can efficiently and deterministically estimate the parameters of model
instances in multi-structure data. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SDF shows superiority over several state-of-the-art fitting methods
for real images with single-structure and multiple-structure data.

 <dc:description>  The genome is a unique identifier for human individuals. The genome also
contains highly sensitive information, creating a high potential for misuse of
genomic data (for example, genetic discrimination). In this paper, I
investigated how genomic privacy can be measured in scenarios where an
adversary aims to infer a person's genomic markers by constructing probability
distributions on the values of genetic variations. I measured the strength of
privacy metrics by requiring that metrics are monotonic with increasing
adversary strength and uncovered serious problems with several existing metrics
currently used to measure genomic privacy. I provide suggestions on metric
selection, interpretation, and visualization, and illustrate the work flow
using a case study on Alzheimer's disease.

 <dc:description>  Big longitudinal observational databases present the opportunity to extract
new knowledge in a cost effective manner. Unfortunately, the ability of these
databases to be used for causal inference is limited due to the passive way in
which the data are collected resulting in various forms of bias. In this paper
we investigate a method that can overcome these limitations and determine
causal contrast set rules efficiently from big data. In particular, we present
a new methodology for the purpose of identifying risk factors that increase a
patients likelihood of experiencing the known rare side effect of renal failure
after ingesting aminosalicylates. The results show that the methodology was
able to identify previously researched risk factors such as being prescribed
diuretics and highlighted that patients with a higher than average risk of
renal failure may be even more susceptible to experiencing it as a side effect
after ingesting aminosalicylates.

 <dc:description>  Games on graphs provide the appropriate framework to study several central
problems in computer science, such as the verification and synthesis of
reactive systems. One of the most basic objectives for games on graphs is the
liveness (or B\&quot;uchi) objective that given a target set of vertices requires
that some vertex in the target set is visited infinitely often. We study
generalized B\&quot;uchi objectives (i.e., conjunction of liveness objectives), and
implications between two generalized B\&quot;uchi objectives (known as GR(1)
objectives), that arise in numerous applications in computer-aided
verification. We present improved algorithms and conditional super-linear lower
bounds based on widely believed assumptions about the complexity of (A1)
combinatorial Boolean matrix multiplication and (A2) CNF-SAT. We consider graph
games with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and generalized B\&quot;uchi objectives with $k$
conjunctions. First, we present an algorithm with running time $O(k \cdot
n^2)$, improving the previously known $O(k \cdot n \cdot m)$ and $O(k^2 \cdot
n^2)$ worst-case bounds. Our algorithm is optimal for dense graphs under (A1).
Second, we show that the basic algorithm for the problem is optimal for sparse
graphs when the target sets have constant size under (A2). Finally, we consider
GR(1) objectives, with $k_1$ conjunctions in the antecedent and $k_2$
conjunctions in the consequent, and present an $O(k_1 \cdot k_2 \cdot
n^{2.5})$-time algorithm, improving the previously known $O(k_1 \cdot k_2 \cdot
n \cdot m)$-time algorithm for $m &gt; n^{1.5}$.

 <dc:title>Learning to Recognize Objects by Retaining other Factors of Variation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Natural images are generated under many factors, including shape, pose,
illumination etc. Most existing ConvNets formulate object recognition from
natural images as a single task classification problem, and attempt to learn
features useful for object categories, but invariant to other factors of
variation as much as possible. These architectures do not explicitly learn
other factors, like pose and lighting, instead, they usually discard them by
pooling and normalization. In this work, we take the opposite approach: we
train ConvNets for object recognition by retaining other factors (pose in our
case) and learn them jointly with object category. We design a new multi-task
leaning (MTL) ConvNet, named disentangling CNN (disCNN), which explicitly
enforces the disentangled representations of object identity and pose, and is
trained to predict object categories and pose transformations. We show that
disCNN achieves significantly better object recognition accuracies than AlexNet
trained solely to predict object categories on the iLab-20M dataset, which is a
large scale turntable dataset with detailed object pose and lighting
information. We further show that the pretrained disCNN/AlexNet features on
iLab- 20M generalize to object recognition on both Washington RGB-D and
ImageNet datasets, and the pretrained disCNN features are significantly better
than the pretrained AlexNet features for fine-tuning object recognition on the
ImageNet dataset.

 <dc:title>Asymptotic bounds on the globally optimal positions of orthogonal
  stiffeners for rectangular plates in elastostatic bending</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Perchikov, Nathan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Analysis of PDEs</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The present paper treats the problem of finding the asymptotic bounds for the
globally optimal locations of orthogonal stiffeners minimizing the compliance
of a rectangular plate in elastostatic bending. The essence of the paper is the
utilization of a method of analysis of orthogonally stiffened rectangular
plates first presented by Mazurkiewicz in 1962, and obtained herein in a closed
form for several special cases in the approximation of stiffeners having zero
torsional rigidity. Asymptotic expansions of the expressions for the deflection
field of a stiffened plate are used to derive limit-case globally optimal
stiffening layouts for highly flexible and highly rigid stiffeners. A central
result obtained in this work is an analytical proof of the fact that an array
of flexible enough orthogonal stiffeners of any number, stiffening a
simply-supported rectangular plate subjected to any lateral loading, is best to
be put in the form of exactly two orthogonal stiffeners, one in each direction.

 <dc:title>Evaluating On-demand Pseudonym Acquisition Policies in Vehicular

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Standardization and harmonization efforts have reached a consensus towards
using a special-purpose Vehicular Public-Key Infrastructure (VPKI) in upcoming
Vehicular Communication (VC) systems. However, there are still several
technical challenges with no conclusive answers; one such an important yet open
challenge is the acquisition of shortterm credentials, pseudonym: how should
each vehicle interact with the VPKI, e.g., how frequently and for how long?
Should each vehicle itself determine the pseudonym lifetime? Answering these
questions is far from trivial. Each choice can affect both the user privacy and
the system performance and possibly, as a result, its security. In this paper,
we make a novel systematic effort to address this multifaceted question. We
craft three generally applicable policies and experimentally evaluate the VPKI
system performance, leveraging two large-scale mobility datasets. We consider
the most promising, in terms of efficiency, pseudonym acquisition policies; we
find that within this class of policies, the most promising policy in terms of
privacy protection can be supported with moderate overhead. Moreover, in all
cases, this work is the first to provide tangible evidence that the
state-of-the-art VPKI can serve sizable areas or domain with modest computing
resources.

 <dc:description>  A major challenge in consumer credit risk portfolio management is to classify
households according to their risk profile. In order to build such risk
profiles it is necessary to employ an approach that analyses data
systematically in order to detect important relationships, interactions,
dependencies and associations amongst the available continuous and categorical
variables altogether and accurately generate profiles of most interesting
household segments according to their credit risk. The objective of this work
is to employ a knowledge discovery from database process to identify groups of
indebted households and describe their profiles using a database collected by
the Consumer Credit Counselling Service (CCCS) in the UK. Employing a framework
that allows the usage of both categorical and continuous data altogether to
find hidden structures in unlabelled data it was established the ideal number
of clusters and such clusters were described in order to identify the
households who exhibit a high propensity of excessive debt levels.

 <dc:title>A Generalized Expression for the Gradient of Mutual Information:
  Application in Multiple Access Channel with Feedback</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new functional approach to describe an expression for
the gradient of mutual information with respect to the system parameters in
general stochastic systems. In this approach the system input can be dependent
on the system parameters in general cases. As an application of this model, it
allows us to express the roles of interference and feedback and their
interactions in a Multiple Access Channel (MAC) system. Using these results, we
extend the mutual information and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) relations to
the additive Gaussian noise MAC with feedback. In this regard, it is shown that
the gradient of mutual information can be decomposed into three distinct parts
that are originated from MMSE, interference and feedback. Then, we interpret
the destructive effect of interference and the constructive impact of feedback
on this channel. Moreover, doing a comparative study we show the capability of
the proposed functional approach to give more insights into the some of the
available results in the literature.

 <dc:description>  Advances in healthcare and in the quality of life significantly increase
human life expectancy. With the ageing of populations, new un-faced challenges
are brought to science. The human body is naturally selected to be
well-functioning until the age of reproduction to keep the species alive.
However, as the lifespan extends, unseen problems due to the body deterioration
emerge. There are several age-related diseases with no appropriate treatment;
therefore, the complex ageing phenomena needs further understanding.
Immunosenescence, the ageing of the immune system, is highly correlated to the
negative effects of ageing, such as the increase of auto-inflammatory diseases
and decrease in responsiveness to new diseases. Besides clinical and
mathematical tools, we believe there is opportunity to further exploit
simulation tools to understand immunosenescence. Compared to real-world
experimentation, benefits include time and cost effectiveness due to the
laborious, resource-intensiveness of the biological environment and the
possibility of conducting experiments without ethic restrictions. Contrasted
with mathematical models, simulation modelling is more suitable for
representing complex systems and emergence. In addition, there is the belief
that simulation models are easier to communicate in interdisciplinary contexts.
Our work investigates the usefulness of simulations to understand
immunosenescence by employing two different simulation methods, agent-based and
system dynamics simulation, to a case study of immune cells depletion with age.

 <dc:description>  In this position paper, we present ideas about creating a next generation
framework towards an adaptive interface for data communication and
visualisation systems. Our objective is to develop a system that accepts large
data sets as inputs and provides user-centric, meaningful visual information to
assist owners to make sense of their data collection. The proposed framework
comprises four stages: (i) the knowledge base compilation, where we search and
collect existing state-ofthe-art visualisation techniques per domain and user
preferences; (ii) the development of the learning and inference system, where
we apply artificial intelligence techniques to learn, predict and recommend new
graphic interpretations (iii) results evaluation; and (iv) reinforcement and
adaptation, where valid outputs are stored in our knowledge base and the system
is iteratively tuned to address new demands. These stages, as well as our
overall vision, limitations and possible challenges are introduced in this
article. We also discuss further extensions of this framework for other
knowledge discovery tasks.

 <dc:title>New Collisions to Improve Pollard's Rho Method of Solving the Discrete
  Logarithm Problem on Elliptic Curves</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Neamah, Ammar Ali</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is true that different approaches have been utilised to accelerate the
computation of discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves with Pollard's Rho
method. However, trapping in cycles fruitless will be obtained by using the
random walks with Pollard's Rho. An efficient alternative approach that is
based on new collisions which are reliant on the values ai , bi to solve this
problem is proposed. This may requires less iterations than Pollard's Rho
original in reaching collision. Thus, the performance of Pollard's Rho method
is more efficiently because the improved method not only reduces the number of
mathematical operations but these collisions can also applied on previous
improvements which reported in the literature.

 <dc:description>  Purpose: To develop a framework for identifying and incorporating candidate
confounding interaction terms into a regularised cox regression analysis to
refine adverse drug reaction signals obtained via longitudinal observational
data. Methods: We considered six drug families that are commonly associated
with myocardial infarction in observational healthcare data, but where the
causal relationship ground truth is known (adverse drug reaction or not). We
applied emergent pattern mining to find itemsets of drugs and medical events
that are associated with the development of myocardial infarction. These are
the candidate confounding interaction terms. We then implemented a cohort study
design using regularised cox regression that incorporated and accounted for the
candidate confounding interaction terms. Results The methodology was able to
account for signals generated due to confounding and a cox regression with
elastic net regularisation correctly ranked the drug families known to be true
adverse drug reactions above those.

 <dc:description>  Uncertain data streams have been widely generated in many Web applications.
The uncertainty in data streams makes anomaly detection from sensor data
streams far more challenging. In this paper, we present a novel framework that
supports anomaly detection in uncertain data streams. The proposed framework
adopts an efficient uncertainty pre-processing procedure to identify and
eliminate uncertainties in data streams. Based on the corrected data streams,
we develop effective period pattern recognition and feature extraction
techniques to improve the computational efficiency. We use classification
methods for anomaly detection in the corrected data stream. We also empirically
show that the proposed approach shows a high accuracy of anomaly detection on a
number of real datasets.

 <dc:description>  Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task that has received
increasing attention from both the computer vision and the natural language
processing communities. Given an image and a question in natural language, it
requires reasoning over visual elements of the image and general knowledge to
infer the correct answer. In the first part of this survey, we examine the
state of the art by comparing modern approaches to the problem. We classify
methods by their mechanism to connect the visual and textual modalities. In
particular, we examine the common approach of combining convolutional and
recurrent neural networks to map images and questions to a common feature
space. We also discuss memory-augmented and modular architectures that
interface with structured knowledge bases. In the second part of this survey,
we review the datasets available for training and evaluating VQA systems. The
various datatsets contain questions at different levels of complexity, which
require different capabilities and types of reasoning. We examine in depth the
question/answer pairs from the Visual Genome project, and evaluate the
relevance of the structured annotations of images with scene graphs for VQA.
Finally, we discuss promising future directions for the field, in particular
the connection to structured knowledge bases and the use of natural language
processing models.

 <dc:description>  How do technology users effectively transit from having zero knowledge about
a technology to making the best use of it after an authoritative technology
adoption? This post-adoption user learning has received little research
attention in technology management literature. In this paper we investigate
user learning in authoritative technology adoption by developing an agent-based
model using the case of council-led smart meter deployment in the UK City of
Leeds. Energy consumers gain experience of using smart meters based on the
learning curve in behavioural learning. With the agent-based model we carry out
experiments to validate the model and test different energy interventions that
local authorities can use to facilitate energy consumers' learning and maintain
their continuous use of the technology. Our results show that the easier energy
consumers become experienced, the more energy-efficient they are and the more
energy saving they can achieve; encouraging energy consumers' contacts via
various informational means can facilitate their learning; and developing and
maintaining their positive attitude toward smart metering can enable them to
use the technology continuously. Contributions and energy policy/intervention
implications are discussed in this paper.

 <dc:description>  This study optimises manually derived rule-based expert system classification
of objects according to changes in their properties over time. One of the key
challenges that this study tries to address is how to classify objects that
exhibit changes in their behaviour over time, for example how to classify
companies' share price stability over a period of time or how to classify
students' preferences for subjects while they are progressing through school. A
specific case the paper considers is the strategy of players in public goods
games (as common in economics) across multiple consecutive games. Initial
classification starts from expert definitions specifying class allocation for
players based on aggregated attributes of the temporal data. Based on these
initial classifications, the optimisation process tries to find an improved
classifier which produces the best possible compact classes of objects
(players) for every time point in the temporal data. The compactness of the
classes is measured by a cost function based on internal cluster indices like
the Dunn Index, distance measures like Euclidean distance or statistically
derived measures like standard deviation. The paper discusses the approach in
the context of incorporating changing player strategies in the aforementioned
public good games, where common classification approaches so far do not
consider such changes in behaviour resulting from learning or in-game
experience. By using the proposed process for classifying temporal data and the
actual players' contribution during the games, we aim to produce a more refined
classification which in turn may inform the interpretation of public goods game
data.

 <dc:description>  Somatosensory inputs can be grossly divided into tactile (or cutaneous) and
proprioceptive -- the former conveying information about skin stimulation, the
latter about limb position and movement. The principal proprioceptors are
constituted by muscle spindles, which deliver information about muscle length
and speed. In primates, this information is relayed to the primary
somatosensory cortex and eventually the posterior parietal cortex, where
integrated information about body posture (postural schema) is presumably
available. However, coming from robotics and seeking a biologically motivated
model that could be used in a humanoid robot, we faced a number of
difficulties. First, it is not clear what neurons in the ascending pathway and
primary somatosensory cortex code. To an engineer, joint angles would seem the
most useful variables. However, the lengths of individual muscles have
nonlinear relationships with the angles at joints. Kim et al. (Neuron, 2015)
found different types of proprioceptive neurons in the primary somatosensory
cortex -- sensitive to movement of single or multiple joints or to static
postures. Second, there are indications that the somatotopic arrangement (&quot;the
homunculus&quot;) of these brain areas is to a significant extent learned. However,
the mechanisms behind this developmental process are unclear. We will report
first results from modeling of this process using data obtained from body
babbling in the iCub humanoid robot and feeding them into a Self-Organizing Map
(SOM). Our results reveal that the SOM algorithm is only suited to develop
receptive fields of the posture-selective type. Furthermore, the SOM algorithm
has intrinsic difficulties when combined with population code on its input and
in particular with nonlinear tuning curves (sigmoids or Gaussians).

 <dc:description>  This paper presents Living Globe, an application for visualization of demo-
graphic data supporting the temporal comparison of data from several countries
represented on a 3D globe. Living Globe allows the visual exploration of the
following demographic data: total population, population density and growth,
crude birth and death rates, life expectancy, net migration and population per-
centage of different age groups. While offering unexperienced users a default
mapping of these data variables into visual variables, Living Globe allows more
advanced users to select the mapping, increasing its flexibility. The main
aspects of the Living Globe model and prototype are described as well as the
evaluation results obtained using heuristic evaluation and usability testing.
Some conclusions and ideas for future work are also presented.

different camera viewpoints -- are at the foundations of geometric methods in
computer vision and are used in geometric camera calibration, image
registration, and stereo vision and other tasks. In this paper, we show the
surprising result that colors across a change in viewing condition (changing
light color, shading and camera) are also related by a homography. We propose a
new color correction method based on color homography. Experiments demonstrate
that solving the color homography problem leads to more accurate calibration.

 <dc:description>  The generation of realistic spatio-temporal trajectories of human mobility is
of fundamental importance in a wide range of applications, such as the
developing of protocols for mobile ad-hoc networks or what-if analysis in urban
ecosystems. Current generative algorithms fail in accurately reproducing the
individuals' recurrent schedules and at the same time in accounting for the
possibility that individuals may break the routine during periods of variable
duration. In this article we present DITRAS (DIary-based TRAjectory Simulator),
a framework to simulate the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility. DITRAS
operates in two steps: the generation of a mobility diary and the translation
of the mobility diary into a mobility trajectory. We propose a data-driven
algorithm which constructs a diary generator from real data, capturing the
tendency of individuals to follow or break their routine. We also propose a
trajectory generator based on the concept of preferential exploration and
preferential return. We instantiate DITRAS with the proposed diary and
trajectory generators and compare the resulting algorithm with real data and
synthetic data produced by other generative algorithms, built by instantiating
DITRAS with several combinations of diary and trajectory generators. We show
that the proposed algorithm reproduces the statistical properties of real
trajectories in the most accurate way, making a step forward the understanding
of the origin of the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility.

 <dc:description>  Aims. We present an innovative artificial neural network (ANN) architecture,
called Generative ANN (GANN), that computes the forward model, that is it
learns the function that relates the unknown outputs (stellar atmospheric
parameters, in this case) to the given inputs (spectra). Such a model can be
integrated in a Bayesian framework to estimate the posterior distribution of
the outputs. Methods. The architecture of the GANN follows the same scheme as a
normal ANN, but with the inputs and outputs inverted. We train the network with
the set of atmospheric parameters (Teff, logg, [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]),
obtaining the stellar spectra for such inputs. The residuals between the
spectra in the grid and the estimated spectra are minimized using a validation
dataset to keep solutions as general as possible. Results. The performance of
both conventional ANNs and GANNs to estimate the stellar parameters as a
function of the star brightness is presented and compared for different
Galactic populations. GANNs provide significantly improved parameterizations
for early and intermediate spectral types with rich and intermediate
metallicities. The behaviour of both algorithms is very similar for our sample
of late-type stars, obtaining residuals in the derivation of [Fe/H] and
[alpha/Fe] below 0.1dex for stars with Gaia magnitude Grvs&lt;12, which accounts
for a number in the order of four million stars to be observed by the Radial
Velocity Spectrograph of the Gaia satellite. Conclusions. Uncertainty
estimation of computed astrophysical parameters is crucial for the validation
of the parameterization itself and for the subsequent exploitation by the
astronomical community. GANNs produce not only the parameters for a given
spectrum, but a goodness-of-fit between the observed spectrum and the predicted
one for a given set of parameters. Moreover, they allow us to obtain the full
posterior distribution...

 <dc:description>  The verification of safety properties for concurrent systems often reduces to
the coverability problem for Petri nets. This problem was shown to be
ExpSpace-complete forty years ago. Driven by the concurrency revolution, it has
regained a lot of interest over the last decade. In this paper, we propose a
generic and simple approach to solve this problem. Our method is inspired from
the recent approach of Blondin, Finkel, Haase and Haddad. Basically, we combine
forward invariant generation techniques for Petri nets with backward
reachability for well- structured transition systems. An experimental
evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of our approach.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an indoor occupancy estimator with which we can estimate
the number of real-time indoor occupants based on the carbon dioxide (CO2)
measurement. The estimator is actually a dynamic model of the occupancy level.
To identify the dynamic model, we propose the Feature Scaled Extreme Learning
Machine (FS-ELM) algorithm, which is a variation of the standard Extreme
Learning Machine (ELM) but is shown to perform better for the occupancy
estimation problem. The measured CO2 concentration suffers from serious spikes.
We find that pre-smoothing the CO2 data can greatly improve the estimation
accuracy. In real applications, however, we cannot obtain the real-time
globally smoothed CO2 data. We provide a way to use the locally smoothed CO2
data instead, which is real-time available. We introduce a new criterion, i.e.
$x$-tolerance accuracy, to assess the occupancy estimator. The proposed
occupancy estimator was tested in an office room with 24 cubicles and 11 open
seats. The accuracy is up to 94 percent with a tolerance of four occupants.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning has gained great popularity due to its widespread success on
many inference problems. We consider the application of deep learning to the
sparse linear inverse problem encountered in compressive sensing, where one
seeks to recover a sparse signal from a small number of noisy linear
measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel neural-network architecture
that decouples prediction errors across layers in the same way that the
approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm decouples them across iterations:
through Onsager correction. Numerical experiments suggest that our &quot;learned
AMP&quot; network significantly improves upon Gregor and LeCun's &quot;learned ISTA&quot;
network in both accuracy and complexity.

 <dc:description>  Illumination effects cause problems for many computer vision algorithms. We
present a user-friendly interactive system for robust illumination-invariant
image generation. Compared with the previous automated illumination-invariant
image derivation approaches, our system enables users to specify a particular
kind of illumination variation for removal. The derivation of
illumination-invariant image is guided by the user input. The input is a stroke
that defines an area covering a set of pixels whose intensities are influenced
predominately by the illumination variation. This additional flexibility
enhances the robustness for processing non-linearly rendered images and the
images of the scenes where their illumination variations are difficult to
estimate automatically. Finally, we present some evaluation results of our
method.

 <dc:description>  Echocardiography plays an important part in diagnostic aid in cardiac
diseases. A critical step in echocardiography-aided diagnosis is to extract the
standard planes since they tend to provide promising views to present different
structures that are benefit to diagnosis. To this end, this paper proposes a
spatial-temporal embedding framework to extract the standard view planes from
4D STIC (spatial-temporal image corre- lation) volumes. The proposed method is
comprised of three stages, the frame smoothing, spatial-temporal embedding and
final classification. In first stage, an L 0 smoothing filter is used to
preprocess the frames that removes the noise and preserves the boundary. Then a
compact repre- sentation is learned via embedding spatial and temporal features
into a latent space in the supervised scheme considering both standard plane
information and diagnosis result. In last stage, the learned features are fed
into support vector machine to identify the standard plane. We eval- uate the
proposed method on a 4D STIC volume dataset with 92 normal cases and 93
abnormal cases in three standard planes. It demonstrates that our method
outperforms the baselines in both classification accuracy and computational
efficiency.

 <dc:description>  The Knowledge Gradient (KG) policy was originally proposed for online ranking
and selection problems but has recently been adapted for use in online decision
making in general and multi-armed bandit problems (MABs) in particular. We
study its use in a class of exponential family MABs and identify weaknesses,
including a propensity to take actions which are dominated with respect to both
exploitation and exploration. We propose variants of KG which avoid such
errors. These new policies include an index heuristic which deploys a KG
approach to develop an approximation to the Gittins index. A numerical study
shows this policy to perform well over a range of MABs including those for
which index policies are not optimal. While KG does not make dominated actions
when bandits are Gaussian, it fails to be index consistent and appears not to
enjoy a performance advantage over competitor policies when arms are correlated
to compensate for its greater computational demands.

 <dc:description>  Appearance based person re-identification in a real-world video surveillance
system with non-overlapping camera views is a challenging problem for many
reasons. Current state-of-the-art methods often address the problem by relying
on supervised learning of similarity metrics or ranking functions to implicitly
model appearance transformation between cameras for each camera pair, or group,
in the system. This requires considerable human effort to annotate data.
Furthermore, the learned models are camera specific and not transferable from
one set of cameras to another. Therefore, the annotation process is required
after every network expansion or camera replacement, which strongly limits
their applicability. Alternatively, we propose a novel modeling approach to
harness complementary appearance information without supervised learning that
significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on
multiple benchmark datasets.

not require any specific equipment, like GNSS signal simulators or rate tables.
The method is based on analyzing closed-loop phase tracking errors. This
enables us to utilize the actual GNSS signal as the frequency reference,
despite the presence of an unknown Doppler shift in it. The method has been
successfully applied to the calibration of an oven-controlled crystal
oscillator.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Time Warping and Geometric Edit Distance: Breaking the Quadratic

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Geometric Edit Distance (GED) are basic
similarity measures between curves or general temporal sequences (e.g., time
series) that are represented as sequences of points in some metric space $(X,
\mathsf{dist})$. The DTW and GED measures are massively used in various fields
of computer science and computational biology, consequently, the tasks of
computing these measures are among the core problems in P. Despite extensive
efforts to find more efficient algorithms, the best-known algorithms for
computing the DTW or GED between two sequences of points in $X = \mathbb{R}^d$
are long-standing dynamic programming algorithms that require quadratic
runtime, even for the one-dimensional case $d = 1$, which is perhaps one of the
most used in practice.
  In this paper, we break the nearly 50 years old quadratic time bound for
computing DTW or GED between two sequences of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}$, by
presenting a deterministic algorithms that run in $O\left( n^2 \log\log\log n /
\log\log n \right)$ time. Our algorithms can be extended to work also for
higher dimensional spaces $X = \mathbb{R}^d$, for any constant $d$, when the
underlying distance-metric $\mathsf{dist}$ is polyhedral (e.g., $L_1$,
$L_\infty$).

 <dc:description>  Next generation deep neural networks for classification hosted on embedded
platforms will rely on fast, efficient, and accurate learning algorithms.
Initialization of weights in learning networks has a great impact on the
classification accuracy. In this paper we focus on deriving good initial
weights by modeling the error function of a deep neural network as a
high-dimensional landscape. We observe that due to the inherent complexity in
its algebraic structure, such an error function may conform to general results
of the statistics of large systems. To this end we apply some results from
Random Matrix Theory to analyse these functions. We model the error function in
terms of a Hamiltonian in N-dimensions and derive some theoretical results
about its general behavior. These results are further used to make better
initial guesses of weights for the learning algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problems of state estimation and false data
injection detection in smart grid when the measurements are corrupted by
colored Gaussian noise. By modeling the noise with the autoregressive process,
we estimate the state of the power transmission networks and develop a
generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector for the detection of false
data injection attacks. We show that the conventional approach with the
assumption of Gaussian noise is a special case of the proposed method, and thus
the new approach has more applicability. {The proposed detector is also tested
on an independent component analysis (ICA) based unobservable false data attack
scheme that utilizes similar assumptions of sample observation.} We evaluate
the performance of the proposed state estimator and attack detector on the IEEE
30-bus power system with comparison to conventional Gaussian noise based
detector. The superior performance of {both observable and unobservable false
data attacks} demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and
indicates a wide application on the power signal processing.

 <dc:description>  We study $k$-GenEV, the problem of finding the top $k$ generalized
eigenvectors, and $k$-CCA, the problem of finding the top $k$ vectors in
canonical-correlation analysis. We propose algorithms $\mathtt{LazyEV}$ and
$\mathtt{LazyCCA}$ to solve the two problems with running times linearly
dependent on the input size and on $k$.
  Furthermore, our algorithms are DOUBLY-ACCELERATED: our running times depend
only on the square root of the matrix condition number, and on the square root
of the eigengap. This is the first such result for both $k$-GenEV or $k$-CCA.
We also provide the first gap-free results, which provide running times that
depend on $1/\sqrt{\varepsilon}$ rather than the eigengap.

 <dc:description>  We study shared multi-processor scheduling problem where each job can be
executed on its private processor and simultaneously on one of many processors
shared by all jobs in order to reduce the job's completion time due to
processing time overlap. The total weighted overlap of all jobs is to be
maximized. The problem models subcontracting scheduling in supply chains and
divisible load scheduling in computing. We show that synchronized schedules
that complete each job at the same time on its private processor and shared
processors, if any is actually used by the job, include optimal schedules. We
prove that the problem is NP-hard in the strong sense for jobs with arbitrary
weights, and we give an efficient, polynomial-time algorithm for the problem
with equal weights.

 <dc:description>  Natural Language Inference is an important task for Natural Language
Understanding. It is concerned with classifying the logical relation between
two sentences. In this paper, we propose several text generative neural
networks for generating text hypothesis, which allows construction of new
Natural Language Inference datasets. To evaluate the models, we propose a new
metric -- the accuracy of the classifier trained on the generated dataset. The
accuracy obtained by our best generative model is only 2.7% lower than the
accuracy of the classifier trained on the original, human crafted dataset.
Furthermore, the best generated dataset combined with the original dataset
achieves the highest accuracy. The best model learns a mapping embedding for
each training example. By comparing various metrics we show that datasets that
obtain higher ROUGE or METEOR scores do not necessarily yield higher
classification accuracies. We also provide analysis of what are the
characteristics of a good dataset including the distinguishability of the
generated datasets from the original one.

 <dc:description>  The quantity of small scale solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays in the United
States has grown rapidly in recent years. As a result, there is substantial
interest in high quality information about the quantity, power capacity, and
energy generated by such arrays, including at a high spatial resolution (e.g.,
counties, cities, or even smaller regions). Unfortunately, existing methods for
obtaining this information, such as surveys and utility interconnection
filings, are limited in their completeness and spatial resolution. This work
presents a computer algorithm that automatically detects PV panels using very
high resolution color satellite imagery. The approach potentially offers a
fast, scalable method for obtaining accurate information on PV array location
and size, and at much higher spatial resolutions than are currently available.
The method is validated using a very large (135 km^2) collection of publicly
available [1] aerial imagery, with over 2,700 human annotated PV array
locations. The results demonstrate the algorithm is highly effective on a
per-pixel basis. It is likewise effective at object-level PV array detection,
but with significant potential for improvement in estimating the precise
shape/size of the PV arrays. These results are the first of their kind for the
detection of solar PV in aerial imagery, demonstrating the feasibility of the
approach and establishing a baseline performance for future investigations.

 <dc:description>  This article presents a two-stage topological algorithm for recovering an
estimate of a quasiperiodic function from a set of noisy measurements. The
first stage of the algorithm is a topological phase estimator, which detects
the quasiperiodic structure of the function without placing additional
restrictions on the function. By respecting this phase estimate, the algorithm
avoids creating distortion even when it uses a large number of samples for the
estimate of the function.

 <dc:description>  We present a 3D object detection method that uses regressed descriptors of
locally-sampled RGB-D patches for 6D vote casting. For regression, we employ a
convolutional auto-encoder that has been trained on a large collection of
random local patches. During testing, scene patch descriptors are matched
against a database of synthetic model view patches and cast 6D object votes
which are subsequently filtered to refined hypotheses. We evaluate on three
datasets to show that our method generalizes well to previously unseen input
data, delivers robust detection results that compete with and surpass the
state-of-the-art while being scalable in the number of objects.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the two-way butterfly network, a class of two-way
four-unicast networks. We first show that bidirectional links do not increase
the degrees of freedom for this network thus giving the first example for
networks, to the best of our knowledge, where bidirectional links do not
increase the degrees of freedom. Further, we see that sufficient caching at the
relays or increasing the number of antennas in the relays can double the
two-way degrees of freedom for butterfly network.

 <dc:description>  Distributed storage systems often employ erasure codes to achieve high data
reliability while attaining space efficiency. Such storage systems are known to
be susceptible to long tails in response time. It has been shown that in modern
online applications such as Bing, Facebook, and Amazon, the long tail of
latency is of particular concern, with $99.9$th percentile response times that
are orders of magnitude worse than the mean. Taming tail latency is very
challenging in erasure-coded storage systems since quantify tail latency (i.e.,
$x$th-percentile latency for arbitrary $x\in[0,1]$) has been a long-standing
open problem. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to quantify {\em
tail index} of service latency for arbitrary erasure-coded storage systems, by
characterizing the asymptotic behavior of latency distribution tails. When file
size has a heavy tailed distribution, we find tail index, defined as the
exponent at which latency tail probability diminishes to zero, in closed-form,
and further show that a family of probabilistic scheduling algorithms are
(asymptotically) optimal since they are able to achieve the exact tail index.

 <dc:description>  We present a scalable method for detecting objects and estimating their 3D
poses in RGB-D data. To this end, we rely on an efficient representation of
object views and employ hashing techniques to match these views against the
input frame in a scalable way. While a similar approach already exists for 2D
detection, we show how to extend it to estimate the 3D pose of the detected
objects. In particular, we explore different hashing strategies and identify
the one which is more suitable to our problem. We show empirically that the
complexity of our method is sublinear with the number of objects and we enable
detection and pose estimation of many 3D objects with high accuracy while
outperforming the state-of-the-art in terms of runtime.

 <dc:description>  In distributed database (DDB) management systems, fragment allocation is one
of the most important components that can directly affect the performance of
DDB. In this research work, we will show that declarative programming
languages, e.g. logic programming languages, can be used to represent different
data fragment allocation techniques. Results indicate that, using declarative
programming language significantly simplifies the representation of fragment
allocation algorithm, thus opens door for any further developments and
optimizations. The under consideration case study also show that our approach
can be extended to be used in different areas of distributed systems.

 <dc:title>Approximating Spanners and Directed Steiner Forest: Upper and Lower

 <dc:description>  It was recently found that there are very close connections between the
existence of additive spanners (subgraphs where all distances are preserved up
to an additive stretch), distance preservers (subgraphs in which demand pairs
have their distance preserved exactly), and pairwise spanners (subgraphs in
which demand pairs have their distance preserved up to a multiplicative or
additive stretch) [Abboud-Godwin SODA '16, Godwin-Williams SODA '16]. We study
these problems from an optimization point of view, where rather than studying
the existence of extremal instances we are given an instance and are asked to
find the sparsest possible spanner/preserver. We give an $O(n^{3/5 +
\epsilon})$-approximation for distance preservers and pairwise spanners (for
arbitrary constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$). This is the first nontrivial upper bound
for either problem, both of which are known to be as hard to approximate as
Label Cover. We also prove Label Cover hardness for approximating additive
spanners, even for the cases of additive 1 stretch (where one might expect a
polylogarithmic approximation, since the related multiplicative 2-spanner
problem admits an $O(\log n)$-approximation) and additive polylogarithmic
stretch (where the related multiplicative spanner problem has an
$O(1)$-approximation).
  Interestingly, the techniques we use in our approximation algorithm extend
beyond distance-based problem to pure connectivity network design problems. In
particular, our techniques allow us to give an $O(n^{3/5 +
\epsilon})$-approximation for the Directed Steiner Forest problem (for
arbitrary constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$) when all edges have uniform costs, improving
the previous best $O(n^{2/3 + \epsilon})$-approximation due to Berman et
al.~[ICALP '11] (which holds for general edge costs).

 <dc:title>The complexity of automatic complexity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Generalizing the notion of automatic complexity of individual strings due to
Shallit and Wang, we define the automatic complexity $A(E)$ of an equivalence
relation $E$ on a finite set $S$ of strings.
  We prove that the problem of determining whether $A(E)$ equals the number
$|E|$ of equivalence classes of $E$ is NP-complete. The problem of determining
whether $A(E) = |E| + k$ for a fixed $k\ge 1$ is complete for the second level
of the Boolean hierarchy for NP, i.e., BH$_2$-complete.
  Let $L$ be the language consisting of all strings of maximal nondeterministic
automatic complexity. We characterize the complexity of infinite subsets of $L$
by showing that they can be co-context-free but not context-free, i.e., $L$ is
CFL-immune, but not coCFL-immune.
  We show that for each $\epsilon&gt;0$, $L_\epsilon\not\in$coCFL, where
$L_\epsilon$ is the set of all strings whose deterministic automatic complexity
$A(x)$ satisfies $A(x)\ge |x|^{1/2-\epsilon}$.

 <dc:description>  Protein structure prediction is considered as one of the most challenging and
computationally intractable combinatorial problem. Thus, the efficient modeling
of convoluted search space, the clever use of energy functions, and more
importantly, the use of effective sampling algorithms become crucial to address
this problem. For protein structure modeling, an off-lattice model provides
limited scopes to exercise and evaluate the algorithmic developments due to its
astronomically large set of data-points. In contrast, an on-lattice model
widens the scopes and permits studying the relatively larger proteins because
of its finite set of data-points. In this work, we took the full advantage of
an on-lattice model by using a face-centered-cube lattice that has the highest
packing density with the maximum degree of freedom. We proposed a graded
energy-strategically mixes the Miyazawa-Jernigan (MJ) energy with the
hydrophobic-polar (HP) energy-based genetic algorithm (GA) for conformational
search. In our application, we introduced a 2x2 HP energy guided macro-mutation
operator within the GA to explore the best possible local changes exhaustively.
Conversely, the 20x20 MJ energy model-the ultimate objective function of our GA
that needs to be minimized-considers the impacts amongst the 20 different amino
acids and allow searching the globally acceptable conformations. On a set of
benchmark proteins, our proposed approach outperformed state-of-the-art
approaches in terms of the free energy levels and the root-mean-square
deviations.

 <dc:description>  Quaternion-valued signals along with quaternion Fourier transforms
(QFT)provide an effective framework for vector-valued signal and image
processing. However, the sampling theory of quaternion valued signals has not
been well developed. In this paper, we present the generalized sampling
expansions associated with QFT by using the generalized translation and
convolution. We show that a {\sigma}-bandlimited quaternion valued signal in
QFT sense can be reconstructed from the samples of output signals of M linear
systems based on QFT. Quaternion linear canonical transform (QLCT) is a
generalization of QFT with six parameters. Using the relationship between QFT,
we derive the sampling formula for {\sigma}-bandlimited quaternion-valued
signal in QLCT sense. Examples are given to illustrate our results.

 <dc:description>  For integers $n\ge s\ge 2$ let $e(n,s)$ denote the maximum of $|\mathcal F|,$
where $\mathcal F$ is a family of subsets of an $n$-element set and $\mathcal
F$ contains no $s$ pairwise disjoint members. Half a century ago, solving a
conjecture of Erd\H os, Kleitman determined $e(sm-1,s)$ and $e(sm,s)$ for all
$m,s\ge 1$. During the years very little progress in the general case was made.
  In the present paper we state a general conjecture concerning the value of
$e(sm-l,m)$ for $1&lt;l&lt;s$ and prove its validity for $s&gt;s_0(l,m).$ For $l=2$ we
determine the value of $e(sm-2,m)$ for all $s\ge 5.$
  Some related results shedding light on the problem from a more general
context are proved as well.

 <dc:title>Sequence to sequence learning for unconstrained scene text recognition</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this work we present a state-of-the-art approach for unconstrained natural
scene text recognition. We propose a cascade approach that incorporates a
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture followed by a long short term
memory model (LSTM). The CNN learns visual features for the characters and uses
them with a softmax layer to detect sequence of characters. While the CNN gives
very good recognition results, it does not model relation between characters,
hence gives rise to false positive and false negative cases (confusing
characters due to visual similarities like &quot;g&quot; and &quot;9&quot;, or confusing background
patches with characters; either removing existing characters or adding
non-existing ones) To alleviate these problems we leverage recent developments
in LSTM architectures to encode contextual information. We show that the LSTM
can dramatically reduce such errors and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in
the task of unconstrained natural scene text recognition. Moreover we manually
remove all occurrences of the words that exist in the test set from our
training set to test whether our approach will generalize to unseen data. We
use the ICDAR 13 test set for evaluation and compare the results with the state
of the art approaches [11, 18]. We finally present an application of the work
in the domain of for traffic monitoring.

 <dc:description>  The families $\mathcal F_1,\ldots, \mathcal F_s\subset 2^{[n]}$ are called
\textit{$q$-dependent} if there are no pairwise disjoint $F_i\in \mathcal F_i,\
i=1,\ldots, s,$ satisfying $|F_1\cup\ldots\cup F_s|\le q.$ We determine $\max
|\mathcal F_1|+\ldots +|\mathcal F_s| $ for \textit{all} values $n\ge q,s\ge
2$. The result provides a far-reaching generalization of an important classical
result of Kleitman. The uniform case $\mathcal F_1 = \ldots = \mathcal
F_s\subset {[n]\choose k}$ of this problem is the so-called Erd\H os Matching
Conjecture. After more than 50 years its full solution is still not in sight.
In the present paper we provide a Hilton-Milner-type stability theorem for it
in a relatively wide range, in particular, for $n\ge (2+o(1))sk$ with $o(1)$
depending on $s$. This is a considerable improvement of a result due to
Bollob\'as, Daykin and Erd\H os.
  We apply our results to advance in an anti-Ramsey-type problem, proposed by
\&quot;Ozkahya and Young. They asked for the minimum number $ar(n,k,s)$ of colors in
the coloring of the $k$-element subsets of $[n]$ that do not contain a
\textit{rainbow matching} of size $s$, that is, $s$ sets of different colors
that are pairwise disjoint. We prove a stability result for the problem, which
allows to determine $ar(n,k,s)$ for all $k\ge 3$ and $n\ge sk+(s-1)(k-1).$ Some
other consequences of our results are presented as well.

 <dc:title>Stochastic dominance and the bijective ratio of online algorithms</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Stochastic dominance is a technique for evaluating the performance of online
algorithms that provides an intuitive, yet powerful stochastic order between
the compared algorithms. Accordingly this holds for bijective analysis, which
can be interpreted as stochastic dominance assuming the uniform distribution
over requests. These techniques have been applied to some online problems, and
have provided a clear separation between algorithms whose performance varies
significantly in practice. However, there are situations in which they are not
readily applicable due to the fact that they stipulate a stringent relation
between the compared algorithms.
  In this paper, we propose remedies for these shortcomings. First, we
establish sufficient conditions that allow us to prove the bijective optimality
of a certain class of algorithms for a wide range of problems; we demonstrate
this approach in the context of some well-studied online problems. Second, to
account for situations in which two algorithms are incomparable or there is no
clear optimum, we introduce the bijective ratio as a natural extension of
(exact) bijective analysis. Our definition readily generalizes to stochastic
dominance. This renders the concept of bijective analysis (and that of
stochastic dominance) applicable to all online problems, and allows for the
incorporation of other useful techniques such as amortized analysis. We
demonstrate the applicability of the bijective ratio to one of the fundamental
online problems, namely the continuous $k$-server problem on metrics such as
the line, the circle, and the star. Among other results, we show that the
greedy algorithm attains bijective ratios of $O(k)$ consistently across these
metrics. These results confirm extensive previous studies that gave evidence of
the efficiency of this algorithm on said metrics in practice, which, however,
is not reflected in competitive analysis.

 <dc:description>  Given $n$ non-vertical pairwise disjoint triangles in 3-space, their vertical
depth (above/below) relation may contain cycles. We show that, for any
$\varepsilon&gt;0$, the triangles can be cut into $O(n^{3/2+\varepsilon})$ pieces,
where each piece is a connected semi-algebraic set whose description complexity
depends only on the choice of $\varepsilon$, such that the depth relation among
these pieces is now a proper partial order. This bound is nearly tight in the
worst case. We are not aware of any previous study of this problem with a
subquadratic bound on the number of pieces.
  This work extends the recent study by two of the authors on eliminating depth
cycles among lines in 3-space. Our approach is again algebraic, and makes use
of a recent variant of the polynomial partitioning technique, due to Guth,
which leads to a recursive procedure for cutting the triangles. In contrast to
the case of lines, our analysis here is considerably more involved, due to the
two-dimensional nature of the objects being cut, so additional tools, from
topology and algebra, need to be brought to bear.
  Our result essentially settles a 35-year-old open problem in computational
geometry, motivated by hidden-surface removal in computer graphics.

 <dc:description>  For many years, Herlihy's elegant computability based Consensus Hierarchy has
been our best explanation of the relative power of various types of
multiprocessor synchronization objects when used in deterministic algorithms.
However, key to this hierarchy is treating synchronization instructions as
distinct objects, an approach that is far from the real-world, where
multiprocessor programs apply synchronization instructions to collections of
arbitrary memory locations. We were surprised to realize that, when considering
instructions applied to memory locations, the computability based hierarchy
collapses. This leaves open the question of how to better capture the power of
various synchronization instructions.
  In this paper, we provide an approach to answering this question. We present
a hierarchy of synchronization instructions, classified by their space
complexity in solving obstruction-free consensus. Our hierarchy provides a
classification of combinations of known instructions that seems to fit with our
intuition of how useful some are in practice, while questioning the
effectiveness of others. We prove an essentially tight characterization of the
power of buffered read and write instructions.Interestingly, we show a similar
result for multi-location atomic assignments.

reference image as subjectively experienced by a human viewer can thus lead to
significant improvements in any transmission, compression, or restoration
system. This paper introduces the Haar wavelet-based perceptual similarity
index (HaarPSI), a novel and computationally inexpensive similarity measure for
full reference image quality assessment. The HaarPSI utilizes the coefficients
obtained from a Haar wavelet decomposition to assess local similarities between
two images, as well as the relative importance of image areas. The consistency
of the HaarPSI with the human quality of experience was validated on four large
benchmark databases containing thousands of differently distorted images. On
these databases, the HaarPSI achieves higher correlations with human opinion
scores than state-of-the-art full reference similarity measures like the
structural similarity index (SSIM), the feature similarity index (FSIM), and
the visual saliency-based index (VSI). Along with the simple computational
structure and the short execution time, these experimental results suggest a
high applicability of the HaarPSI in real world tasks.

 <dc:title>Strong Hardness of Privacy from Weak Traitor Tracing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Despite much study, the computational complexity of differential privacy
remains poorly understood. In this paper we consider the computational
complexity of accurately answering a family $Q$ of statistical queries over a
data universe $X$ under differential privacy. A statistical query on a dataset
$D \in X^n$ asks &quot;what fraction of the elements of $D$ satisfy a given
predicate $p$ on $X$?&quot; Dwork et al. (STOC'09) and Boneh and Zhandry (CRYPTO'14)
showed that if both $Q$ and $X$ are of polynomial size, then there is an
efficient differentially private algorithm that accurately answers all the
queries, and if both $Q$ and $X$ are exponential size, then under a plausible
assumption, no efficient algorithm exists.
  We show that, under the same assumption, if either the number of queries or
the data universe is of exponential size, and the other has size at least
$\tilde{O}(n^7)$, then there is no differentially private algorithm that
answers all the queries. In both cases, the result is nearly quantitatively
tight, since there is an efficient differentially private algorithm that
answers $\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$ queries on an exponential size data universe, and
one that answers exponentially many queries on a data universe of size
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$.
  Our proofs build on the connection between hardness results in differential
privacy and traitor-tracing schemes (Dwork et al., STOC'09; Ullman, STOC'13).
We prove our hardness result for a polynomial size query set (resp., data
universe) by showing that they follow from the existence of a special type of
traitor-tracing scheme with very short ciphertexts (resp., secret keys), but
very weak security guarantees, and then constructing such a scheme.

 <dc:title>Improved bounds on the decoding failure probability of network coding

 <dc:creator>Khan, Amjad Saeed</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Chatzigeorgiou, Ioannis</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers a multi-source multi-relay network, in which relay nodes
employ a coding scheme based on random linear network coding on source packets
and generate coded packets. If a destination node collects enough coded
packets, it can recover the packets of all source nodes. The links between
source-to-relay nodes and relay-to-destination nodes are modeled as packet
erasure channels. Improved bounds on the probability of decoding failure are
presented, which are markedly close to simulation results and notably better
than previous bounds. Examples demonstrate the tightness and usefulness of the
new bounds over the old bounds.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we focus on the spatial nature of visual domain shift,
attempting to learn where domain adaptation originates in each given image of
the source and target set. We borrow concepts and techniques from the CNN
visualization literature, and learn domainnes maps able to localize the degree
of domain specificity in images. We derive from these maps features related to
different domainnes levels, and we show that by considering them as a
preprocessing step for a domain adaptation algorithm, the final classification
performance is strongly improved. Combined with the whole image representation,
these features provide state of the art results on the Office dataset.

 <dc:description>  We present an efficient distributed memory parallel algorithm for computing
connected components in undirected graphs based on Shiloach-Vishkin's PRAM
approach. We discuss multiple optimization techniques that reduce communication
volume as well as load-balance the algorithm. We also note that the efficiency
of the parallel graph connectivity algorithm depends on the underlying graph
topology. Particularly for short diameter graph components, we observe that
parallel Breadth First Search (BFS) method offers better performance. However,
running parallel BFS is not efficient for computing large diameter components
or large number of small components. To address this challenge, we employ a
heuristic that allows the algorithm to quickly predict the type of the network
by computing the degree distribution and follow the optimal hybrid route. Using
large graphs with diverse topologies from domains including metagenomics, web
crawl, social graph and road networks, we show that our hybrid implementation
is efficient and scalable for each of the graph types. Our approach achieves a
runtime of 215 seconds using 32K cores of Cray XC30 for a metagenomic graph
with over 50 billion edges. When compared against the previous state-of-the-art
method, we see performance improvements up to 24x.

 <dc:description>  Lines are the most essential and discriminative features of palmprint images,
which motivate researches to propose various line direction based methods for
palmprint recognition. Conventional methods usually capture the only one of the
most dominant direction of palmprint images. However, a number of points in
palmprint images have double or even more than two dominant directions because
of a plenty of crossing lines of palmprint images. In this paper, we propose a
local multiple directional pattern (LMDP) to effectively characterize the
multiple direction features of palmprint images. LMDP can not only exactly
denote the number and positions of dominant directions but also effectively
reflect the confidence of each dominant direction. Then, a simple and effective
coding scheme is designed to represent the LMDP and a block-wise LMDP
descriptor is used as the feature space of palmprint images in palmprint
recognition. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the
LMDP over the conventional powerful descriptors and the state-of-the-art
direction based methods in palmprint recognition.

 <dc:description>  Given an $n$-dimensional convex body by a membership oracle in general, it is
known that any polynomial-time deterministic algorithm cannot approximate its
volume within ratio $(n/\log n)^n$. There is a substantial progress on
randomized approximation such as Markov chain Monte Carlo for a
high-dimensional volume, and for many #P-hard problems, while some
deterministic approximation algorithms are recently developed only for a few
#P-hard problems. Motivated by a deterministic approximation of the volume of a
${\cal V}$-polytope, that is a polytope with few vertices and (possibly)
exponentially many facets, this paper investigates the volume of a &quot;knapsack
dual polytope,&quot; which is known to be #P-hard due to Khachiyan (1989). We reduce
an approximate volume of a knapsack dual polytope to that of the intersection
of two cross-polytopes, and give FPTASs for those volume computations.
Interestingly, the volume of the intersection of two cross-polytopes (i.e.,
$L_1$-balls) is #P-hard, unlike the cases of $L_{\infty}$-balls or $L_2$-balls.

descriptors for tracking applications. Many different descriptors have been
proposed in the literature for a wide range of application in computer vision
such as object recognition and 3D reconstruction. More recently, due to fast
key-point detectors, local image features can be used in online tracking
frameworks. However, while much effort has been spent on evaluating their
performance in terms of distinctiveness and robustness to image
transformations, very little has been done in the contest of tracking. Our
evaluation is performed in terms of distinctiveness, tracking precision and
tracking speed. Our results show that binary descriptors like ORB or BRISK have
comparable results to SIFT or AKAZE due to a higher number of key-points.

 <dc:title>Hybrid LSH: Faster Near Neighbors Reporting in High-dimensional Space</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pham, Ninh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the $r$-near neighbors reporting problem ($r$-NN), i.e., reporting
\emph{all} points in a high-dimensional point set $S$ that lie within a radius
$r$ of a given query point $q$. Our approach builds upon on the
locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) framework due to its appealing asymptotic
sublinear query time for near neighbor search problems in high-dimensional
space. A bottleneck of the traditional LSH scheme for solving $r$-NN is that
its performance is sensitive to data and query-dependent parameters. On
datasets whose data distributions have diverse local density patterns, LSH with
inappropriate tuning parameters can sometimes be outperformed by a simple
linear search.
  In this paper, we introduce a hybrid search strategy between LSH-based search
and linear search for $r$-NN in high-dimensional space. By integrating an
auxiliary data structure into LSH hash tables, we can efficiently estimate the
computational cost of LSH-based search for a given query regardless of the data
distribution. This means that we are able to choose the appropriate search
strategy between LSH-based search and linear search to achieve better
performance. Moreover, the integrated data structure is time efficient and fits
well with many recent state-of-the-art LSH-based approaches. Our experiments on
real-world datasets show that the hybrid search approach outperforms (or is
comparable to) both LSH-based search and linear search for a wide range of
search radii and data distributions in high-dimensional space.

 <dc:description>  The increasing popularity of real-world recommender systems produces data
continuously and rapidly, and it becomes more realistic to study recommender
systems under streaming scenarios. Data streams present distinct properties
such as temporally ordered, continuous and high-velocity, which poses
tremendous challenges to traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of recommendation with stream inputs. In particular, we
provide a principled framework termed sRec, which provides explicit
continuous-time random process models of the creation of users and topics, and
of the evolution of their interests. A variational Bayesian approach called
recursive meanfield approximation is proposed, which permits computationally
efficient instantaneous on-line inference. Experimental results on several
real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of our sRec over other
state-of-the-arts.

 <dc:description>  Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification Systems (FRBCSs) have the potential to
provide so-called interpretable classifiers, i.e. classifiers which can be
introspective, understood, validated and augmented by human experts by relying
on fuzzy-set based rules. This paper builds on prior work for interval type-2
fuzzy set based FRBCs where the fuzzy sets and rules of the classifier are
generated using an initial clustering stage. By introducing Subtractive
Clustering in order to identify multiple cluster prototypes, the proposed
approach has the potential to deliver improved classification performance while
maintaining good interpretability, i.e. without resulting in an excessive
number of rules. The paper provides a detailed overview of the proposed FRBC
framework, followed by a series of exploratory experiments on both linearly and
non-linearly separable datasets, comparing results to existing rule-based and
SVM approaches. Overall, initial results indicate that the approach enables
comparable classification performance to non rule-based classifiers such as
SVM, while often achieving this with a very small number of rules.

 <dc:description>  In the context of cancer treatment and surgery, quality of life assessment is
a crucial part of determining treatment success and viability. In order to
assess it, patients completed questionnaires which employ words to capture
aspects of patients well-being are the norm. As the results of these
questionnaires are often used to assess patient progress and to determine
future treatment options, it is important to establish that the words used are
interpreted in the same way by both patients and medical professionals. In this
paper, we capture and model patients perceptions and associated uncertainty
about the words used to describe the level of their physical function used in
the highly common (in Sarcoma Services) Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS)
questionnaire. The paper provides detail about the interval-valued data capture
as well as the subsequent modelling of the data using fuzzy sets. Based on an
initial sample of participants, we use Jaccard similarity on the resulting
words models to show that there may be considerable differences in the
interpretation of commonly used questionnaire terms, thus presenting a very
real risk of miscommunication between patients and medical professionals as
well as within the group of medical professionals.

 <dc:description>  This paper primarily addresses a dataset relating to cellular, chemical and
physical conditions of patients gathered at the time they are operated upon to
remove colorectal tumours. This data provides a unique insight into the
biochemical and immunological status of patients at the point of tumour removal
along with information about tumour classification and post-operative survival.
The relationship between severity of tumour, based on TNM staging, and survival
is still unclear for patients with TNM stage 2 and 3 tumours. We ask whether it
is possible to predict survival rate more accurately using a selection of
machine learning techniques applied to subsets of data to gain a deeper
understanding of the relationships between a patient's biochemical markers and
survival. We use a range of feature selection and single classification
techniques to predict the 5 year survival rate of TNM stage 2 and 3 patients
which initially produces less than ideal results. The performance of each model
individually is then compared with subsets of the data where agreement is
reached for multiple models. This novel method of selective ensembling
demonstrates that significant improvements in model accuracy on an unseen test
set can be achieved for patients where agreement between models is achieved.
Finally we point at a possible method to identify whether a patients prognosis
can be accurately predicted or not.

 <dc:description>  Big longitudinal observational medical data potentially hold a wealth of
information and have been recognised as potential sources for gaining new drug
safety knowledge. Unfortunately there are many complexities and underlying
issues when analysing longitudinal observational data. Due to these
complexities, existing methods for large-scale detection of negative side
effects using observational data all tend to have issues distinguishing between
association and causality. New methods that can better discriminate causal and
non-causal relationships need to be developed to fully utilise the data. In
this paper we propose using a set of causality considerations developed by the
epidemiologist Bradford Hill as a basis for engineering features that enable
the application of supervised learning for the problem of detecting negative
side effects. The Bradford Hill considerations look at various perspectives of
a drug and outcome relationship to determine whether it shows causal traits. We
taught a classifier to find patterns within these perspectives and it learned
to discriminate between association and causality. The novelty of this research
is the combination of supervised learning and Bradford Hill's causality
considerations to automate the Bradford Hill's causality assessment. We
evaluated the framework on a drug safety gold standard know as the
observational medical outcomes partnership's nonspecified association reference
set. The methodology obtained excellent discriminate ability with area under
the curves ranging between 0.792-0.940 (existing method optimal: 0.73) and a
mean average precision of 0.640 (existing method optimal: 0.141). The proposed
features can be calculated efficiently and be readily updated, making the
framework suitable for big observational data.

 <dc:title>Faster Graph Coloring in Polynomial Space</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gaspers, Serge</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lee, Edward</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a polynomial-space algorithm that computes the number independent
sets of any input graph in time $O(1.1387^n)$ for graphs with maximum degree 3
and in time $O(1.2355^n)$ for general graphs, where n is the number of
vertices. Together with the inclusion-exclusion approach of Bj\&quot;orklund,
Husfeldt, and Koivisto [SIAM J. Comput. 2009], this leads to a faster
polynomial-space algorithm for the graph coloring problem with running time
$O(2.2355^n)$. As a byproduct, we also obtain an exponential-space
$O(1.2330^n)$ time algorithm for counting independent sets. Our main algorithm
counts independent sets in graphs with maximum degree 3 and no vertex with
three neighbors of degree 3. This polynomial-space algorithm is analyzed using
the recently introduced Separate, Measure and Conquer approach [Gaspers &amp;
Sorkin, ICALP 2015]. Using Wahlstr\&quot;om's compound measure approach, this
improvement in running time for small degree graphs is then bootstrapped to
larger degrees, giving the improvement for general graphs. Combining both
approaches leads to some inflexibility in choosing vertices to branch on for
the small-degree cases, which we counter by structural graph properties.

 <dc:title>Greedy bi-criteria approximations for $k$-medians and $k$-means</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the following natural greedy procedure for clustering
in the bi-criterion setting: iteratively grow a set of centers, in each round
adding the center from a candidate set that maximally decreases clustering
cost. In the case of $k$-medians and $k$-means, the key results are as follows.
  $\bullet$ When the method considers all data points as candidate centers,
then selecting $\mathcal{O}(k\log(1/\varepsilon))$ centers achieves cost at
most $2+\varepsilon$ times the optimal cost with $k$ centers.
  $\bullet$ Alternatively, the same guarantees hold if each round samples
$\mathcal{O}(k/\varepsilon^5)$ candidate centers proportionally to their
cluster cost (as with $\texttt{kmeans++}$, but holding centers fixed).
  $\bullet$ In the case of $k$-means, considering an augmented set of
$n^{\lceil1/\varepsilon\rceil}$ candidate centers gives $1+\varepsilon$
approximation with $\mathcal{O}(k\log(1/\varepsilon))$ centers, the entire
algorithm taking
$\mathcal{O}(dk\log(1/\varepsilon)n^{1+\lceil1/\varepsilon\rceil})$ time, where
$n$ is the number of data points in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  $\bullet$ In the case of Euclidean $k$-medians, generating a candidate set
via $n^{\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ executions of stochastic gradient
descent with adaptively determined constraint sets will once again give
approximation $1+\varepsilon$ with $\mathcal{O}(k\log(1/\varepsilon))$ centers
in $dk\log(1/\varepsilon)n^{\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ time.
  Ancillary results include: guarantees for cluster costs based on powers of
metrics; a brief, favorable empirical evaluation against $\texttt{kmeans++}$;
data-dependent bounds allowing $1+\varepsilon$ in the first two bullets above,
for example with $k$-medians over finite metric spaces.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a variation of the skip-gram model which jointly
learns distributed word vector representations and their way of composing to
form phrase embeddings. In particular, we propose a learning procedure that
incorporates a phrase-compositionality function which can capture how we want

show improvement in word and phrase similarity tasks as well as syntactic tasks
like dependency parsing using the proposed joint models.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, cross-modal retrieval has drawn much attention due to the
rapid growth of multimodal data. It takes one type of data as the query to
retrieve relevant data of another type. For example, a user can use a text to
retrieve relevant pictures or videos. Since the query and its retrieved results
can be of different modalities, how to measure the content similarity between
different modalities of data remains a challenge. Various methods have been
proposed to deal with such a problem. In this paper, we first review a number
of representative methods for cross-modal retrieval and classify them into two
main groups: 1) real-valued representation learning, and 2) binary
representation learning. Real-valued representation learning methods aim to
learn real-valued common representations for different modalities of data. To
speed up the cross-modal retrieval, a number of binary representation learning
methods are proposed to map different modalities of data into a common Hamming
space. Then, we introduce several multimodal datasets in the community, and
show the experimental results on two commonly used multimodal datasets. The
comparison reveals the characteristic of different kinds of cross-modal
retrieval methods, which is expected to benefit both practical applications and
future research. Finally, we discuss open problems and future research
directions.

 <dc:description>  A social behavior analysis is used to study how a group of people interacts
with another group. The analysis helps to understand how social behavior leads
to its consequences such as what business decision is made after a
businessmen's meeting. In this paper, we focus on visual human motion analysis
which is one important component of social behavior analysis. Human motion
analysis in visual surveillance usually tracks the motion of an individual or a
group of people, yet social behavior is usually neglected. This paper first
delivers a literature survey of visual surveillance, with emphasis on aspects
of human motion analysis and social behavior. Second, it offers a perspective
for social behavior analysis in an intelligent visual human monitoring system.
Third, a social interaction is induced by a social behavior between two
persons, one person and one group, or two groups, hence three general scenarios
of social interactions are outlined for future theoretical development. The
proposed human monitoring system enables the generation of valuable quantified
information of social interactions. It provides an objective approach to
evaluate performance of a human organization such as a company or a school.
Finally, it can raise the awareness of researchers to further explore the field
of social behavior analysis.

 <dc:description>  Sentiment Analysis (SA) is indeed a fascinating area of research which has
stolen the attention of researchers as it has many facets and more importantly
it promises economic stakes in the corporate and governance sector. SA has been
stemmed out of text analytics and established itself as a separate identity and
a domain of research. The wide ranging results of SA have proved to influence
the way some critical decisions are taken. Hence, it has become relevant in
thorough understanding of the different dimensions of the input, output and the
processes and approaches of SA.

 <dc:description>  As an alternative to the traditional sampling theory, compressed sensing
allows acquiring much smaller amount of data, still estimating the spectra of
frequency-sparse signals accurately. However, compressed sensing usually
requires random sampling in data acquisition, which is difficult to implement
in hardware. In this paper, we propose a deterministic and simple sampling
scheme, that is, sampling at three sub-Nyquist rates which have coprime
undersampled ratios. This sampling method turns out to be valid through
numerical experiments. A complex-valued multitask algorithm based on
variational Bayesian inference is proposed to estimate the spectra of
frequency-sparse signals after sampling. Simulations show that this method is
feasible and robust at quite low sampling rates.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cloud radio access networks (C-RAN) are a promising technology to enable the
ambitious vision of the fifth generation (5G) communication networks. In spite
of the potential benefits of C-RAN, the operational costs are still a
challenging issue, mainly due to the centralized processing scheme and the
large number of operating remote radio head (RRH) connecting to the cloud. In
this work we consider a setup in which a CRAN is powered partially with a set
of renewable energy sources (RESs), our aim is to minimize the
processing/backhauling costs at the cloud centre as well as the transmission
power at the RRHs, while satisfying some user quality of service (QoS). This
problem is first formulated as a mixed integer non linear program (MINLP) with
a large number of optimization variables. The underlying NLP is non-convex,
though we address this issue through reformulating the problem using the mean
squared error (MSE)-rate relation. To account to the large-scale of the
problem, we introduce slack variables to decompose the reformulated (MINLP) and
enable the application of a distributed optimization framework by using the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm.

 <dc:title>A neurofeedback system to promote learner engagement</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This report describes a series of experiments that track novice programmer's
engagement during two attention based tasks. The tasks required participants to
watch a tutorial video on introductory programming and to attend to a simple
maze game whilst wearing an electroencephalogram (EEG)device called the Emotiv
EPOC. The EPOC's proprietary software includes a system which tracks emotional
state (specifically: engagement, excitement, meditation, frustration, valence
and long-term excitement). Using this data, a software application written in
the Processing language was developed to track user's engagement levels and
implement a neurofeedback based intervention when engagement fell below an
acceptable level. The aim of the intervention was to prompt learners who
disengaged with the task to re-engage. The intervention used during the video
tutorial was to pause the video if a participant disengaged significantly.
However other interventions such as slowing the video down, playing a noise or
darkening/brightening the screen could also be used. For the maze game, the
caterpillar moving through the maze slowed in line with disengagement and moved
more quickly once the learner re-engaged. The approach worked very well and
successfully re-engaged participants, although a number of improvements could
be made. A number of interesting findings on the comparative engagement levels
of different groups e.g. by gender and by age etc. were identified and provide
useful pointers for future research studies.

 <dc:description>  This paper provides a comprehensive survey of methods dealing with visibility
enhancement of images taken in hazy or foggy scenes. The survey begins with
discussing the optical models of atmospheric scattering media and image
formation. This is followed by a survey of existing methods, which are grouped
to multiple image methods, polarizing filters based methods, methods with known
depth, and single-image methods. We also provide a benchmark of a number of
well known single-image methods, based on a recent dataset provided by Fattal
and our newly generated scattering media dataset that contains ground truth
images for quantitative evaluation. To our knowledge, this is the first
benchmark using numerical metrics to evaluate dehazing techniques. This
benchmark allows us to objectively compare the results of existing methods and
to better identify the strengths and limitations of each method.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Pose-Robust Facial Expression Recognition by Multi-View Pairwise
  Conditional Random Forests</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Automatic facial expression classification (FER) from videos is a critical
problem for the development of intelligent human-computer interaction systems.
Still, it is a challenging problem that involves capturing high-dimensional
spatio-temporal patterns describing the variation of one's appearance over
time. Such representation undergoes great variability of the facial morphology
and environmental factors as well as head pose variations. In this paper, we
use Conditional Random Forests to capture low-level expression transition
patterns. More specifically, heterogeneous derivative features (e.g. feature
point movements or texture variations) are evaluated upon pairs of images. When
testing on a video frame, pairs are created between this current frame and
previous ones and predictions for each previous frame are used to draw trees
from Pairwise Conditional Random Forests (PCRF) whose pairwise outputs are
averaged over time to produce robust estimates. Moreover, PCRF collections can
also be conditioned on head pose estimation for multi-view dynamic FER. As
such, our approach appears as a natural extension of Random Forests for
learning spatio-temporal patterns, potentially from multiple viewpoints.
Experiments on popular datasets show that our method leads to significant
improvements over standard Random Forests as well as state-of-the-art
approaches on several scenarios, including a novel multi-view video corpus
generated from a publicly available database.

 <dc:description>  Due to its scale and largely interconnected nature, the Internet of Things
(IoT) will be vulnerable to a number of security threats that range from
physical layer attacks to network layer attacks. In this paper, a novel
anti-jamming strategy for OFDM-based IoT systems is proposed which enables an
IoT controller to protect the IoT devices against a malicious radio jammer. The
interaction between the controller node and the jammer is modeled as a Colonel
Blotto game with continuous and asymmetric resources in which the IoT
controller, acting as defender, seeks to thwart the jamming attack by
distributing its power among the subcarries in a smart way to decrease the
aggregate bit error rate (BER) caused by the jammer. The jammer, on the other
hand, aims at disrupting the system performance by allocating jamming power to
different frequency bands. To solve the game, an evolutionary algorithm is
proposed which can find a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of the Blotto game.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm enables the IoT controller
to maintain the BER above an acceptable threshold, thereby preserving the IoT
network performance in the presence of malicious jamming.

 <dc:title>On Composition and Implementation of Sequential Consistency</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  To implement a linearizable shared memory in synchronous message-passing
systems it is necessary to wait for a time linear to the uncertainty in the
latency of the network for both read and write operations. Waiting only for one
of them suffices for sequential consistency. This paper extends this result to
crash-prone asynchronous systems, proposing a distributed algorithm building a
sequentially consistent shared snapshot memory on top of an asynchronous
message-passing system where less than half of the processes may crash. We
prove that waiting is needed only when a process invokes a read/snapshot right
after a write. We also show that sequential consistency is composable in some
cases commonly encountered: 1) objects that would be linearizable if they were
implemented on top of a linearizable memory become sequentially consistent when
implemented on top of a sequential memory while remaining composable and 2) in
round-based algorithms, where each object is only accessed within one round.

There haven't been any structural changes respect to previous versions, which
means that most of its limitations still persist. The biggest changes are the
addition of five new language rankings (Russian, Korean, Polish, Ukrainian, and
Indonesian) and elimination of two other language rankings (Italian and Dutch).
In addition, for reasons still unknown, this new edition doesn't include as
many working paper and discussion paper series as previous editions.

 <dc:description>  For the biomedical sciences, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) make
available a rich feature which cannot currently be merged properly with widely
used citing/cited data. Here, we provide methods and routines that make MeSH
terms amenable to broader usage in the study of science indicators: using
Web-of-Science (WoS) data, one can generate the matrix of citing versus cited
documents; using PubMed/MEDLINE data, a matrix of the citing documents versus
MeSH terms can be generated analogously. The two matrices can also be
reorganized into a 2-mode matrix of MeSH terms versus cited references. Using
the abbreviated journal names in the references, one can, for example, address
the question whether MeSH terms can be used as an alternative to WoS Subject
Categories for the purpose of normalizing citation data. We explore the
applicability of the routines in the case of a research program about the
amyloid cascade hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). One conclusion is that
referenced journals provide archival structures, whereas MeSH terms indicate
mainly variation (including novelty) at the research front. Furthermore, we
explore the option of using the citing/cited matrix for main-path analysis as a
by-product of the software.

 <dc:description>  Wearable cameras allow people to record their daily activities from a
user-centered (First Person Vision) perspective. Due to their favorable
location, wearable cameras frequently capture the hands of the user, and may
thus represent a promising user-machine interaction tool for different
applications. Existent First Person Vision methods handle hand segmentation as
a background-foreground problem, ignoring two important facts: i) hands are not
a single &quot;skin-like&quot; moving element, but a pair of interacting cooperative
entities, ii) close hand interactions may lead to hand-to-hand occlusions and,
as a consequence, create a single hand-like segment. These facts complicate a
proper understanding of hand movements and interactions. Our approach extends
traditional background-foreground strategies, by including a
hand-identification step (left-right) based on a Maxwell distribution of angle
and position. Hand-to-hand occlusions are addressed by exploiting temporal
superpixels. The experimental results show that, in addition to a reliable
left/right hand-segmentation, our approach considerably improves the
traditional background-foreground hand-segmentation.

 <dc:description>  The emergence of cloud computing based on virtualization technologies brings
huge opportunities to host virtual resource at low cost without the need of
owning any infrastructure. Virtualization technologies enable users to acquire,
configure and be charged on pay-per-use basis. However, Cloud data centers
mostly comprise heterogeneous commodity servers hosting multiple virtual
machines (VMs) with potential various specifications and fluctuating resource
usages, which may cause imbalanced resource utilization within servers that may
lead to performance degradation and service level agreements (SLAs) violations.
To achieve efficient scheduling, these challenges should be addressed and
solved by using load balancing strategies, which have been proved to be NP-hard
problem. From multiple perspectives, this work identifies the challenges and
analyzes existing algorithms for allocating VMs to PMs in infrastructure
Clouds, especially focuses on load balancing. A detailed classification
targeting load balancing algorithms for VM placement in cloud data centers is
investigated and the surveyed algorithms are classified according to the
classification. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive and
comparative understanding of existing literature and aid researchers by
providing an insight for potential future enhancements.

 <dc:description>  Given a finite set in a metric space, the topological analysis generalizes
hierarchical clustering using a 1-parameter family of homology groups to
quantify connectivity in all dimensions. The connectivity is compactly
described by the persistence diagram. One limitation of the current framework
is the reliance on metric distances, whereas in many practical applications
objects are compared by non-metric dissimilarity measures. Examples are the
Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is commonly used for comparing text and
images, and the Itakura-Saito divergence, popular for speech and sound. These
are two members of the broad family of dissimilarities called Bregman
divergences.
  We show that the framework of topological data analysis can be extended to
general Bregman divergences, widening the scope of possible applications. In
particular, we prove that appropriately generalized Cech and Delaunay (alpha)
complexes capture the correct homotopy type, namely that of the corresponding
union of Bregman balls. Consequently, their filtrations give the correct
persistence diagram, namely the one generated by the uniformly growing Bregman
balls. Moreover, we show that unlike the metric setting, the filtration of
Vietoris-Rips complexes may fail to approximate the persistence diagram. We
propose algorithms to compute the thus generalized Cech, Vietoris-Rips and
Delaunay complexes and experimentally test their efficiency. Lastly, we explain
their surprisingly good performance by making a connection with discrete Morse
theory.

 <dc:description>  While question answering (QA) with neural network, i.e. neural QA, has
achieved promising results in recent years, lacking of large scale real-word QA
dataset is still a challenge for developing and evaluating neural QA system. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a large scale human annotated real-world QA
dataset WebQA with more than 42k questions and 556k evidences. As existing
neural QA methods resolve QA either as sequence generation or
classification/ranking problem, they face challenges of expensive softmax
computation, unseen answers handling or separate candidate answer generation
component. In this work, we cast neural QA as a sequence labeling problem and
propose an end-to-end sequence labeling model, which overcomes all the above
challenges. Experimental results on WebQA show that our model outperforms the
baselines significantly with an F1 score of 74.69% with word-based input, and
the performance drops only 3.72 F1 points with more challenging character-based
input.

 <dc:description>  Predictive modeling applications increasingly use data representing people's
behavior, opinions, and interactions. Fine-grained behavior data often has
different structure from traditional data, being very high-dimensional and
sparse. Models built from these data are quite difficult to interpret, since
they contain many thousands or even many millions of features. Listing features
with large model coefficients is not sufficient, because the model coefficients
do not incorporate information on feature presence, which is key when analysing
sparse data. In this paper we introduce two alternatives for explaining
predictive models by listing important features. We evaluate these alternatives
in terms of explanation &quot;bang for the buck,&quot;, i.e., how many examples'
inferences are explained for a given number of features listed. The bottom
line: (i) The proposed alternatives have double the bang-for-the-buck as
compared to just listing the high-coefficient features, and (ii) interestingly,
although they come from different sources and motivations, the two new
alternatives provide strikingly similar rankings of important features.

 <dc:description>  Event cameras or neuromorphic cameras mimic the human perception system as
they measure the per-pixel intensity change rather than the actual intensity
level. In contrast to traditional cameras, such cameras capture new information
about the scene at MHz frequency in the form of sparse events. The high
temporal resolution comes at the cost of losing the familiar per-pixel
intensity information. In this work we propose a variational model that
accurately models the behaviour of event cameras, enabling reconstruction of
intensity images with arbitrary frame rate in real-time. Our method is
formulated on a per-event-basis, where we explicitly incorporate information
about the asynchronous nature of events via an event manifold induced by the
relative timestamps of events. In our experiments we verify that solving the
variational model on the manifold produces high-quality images without
explicitly estimating optical flow.

 <dc:description>  Phylogenetic networks are increasingly used in evolutionary biology to
represent the history of species that have undergone reticulate events such as
horizontal gene transfer, hybrid speciation and recombination. One of the most
fundamental questions that arise in this context is whether the evolution of a
gene with one copy in all species can be explained by a given network. In
mathematical terms, this is often translated in the following way: is a given
phylogenetic tree contained in a given phylogenetic network? Recently this tree
containment problem has been widely investigated from a computational
perspective, but most studies have only focused on the topology of the phylo-
genies, ignoring a piece of information that, in the case of phylogenetic
trees, is routinely inferred by evolutionary analyses: branch lengths. These
measure the amount of change (e.g., nucleotide substitutions) that has occurred
along each branch of the phylogeny. Here, we study a number of versions of the
tree containment problem that explicitly account for branch lengths. We show
that, although length information has the potential to locate more precisely a
tree within a network, the problem is computationally hard in its most general
form. On a positive note, for a number of special cases of biological
relevance, we provide algorithms that solve this problem efficiently. This
includes the case of networks of limited complexity, for which it is possible
to recover, among the trees contained by the network with the same topology as
the input tree, the closest one in terms of branch lengths.

 <dc:title>Confidence-Weighted Local Expression Predictions for Occlusion Handling

 <dc:description>  Fully-Automatic Facial Expression Recognition (FER) from still images is a
challenging task as it involves handling large interpersonal morphological
differences, and as partial occlusions can occasionally happen. Furthermore,
labelling expressions is a time-consuming process that is prone to
subjectivity, thus the variability may not be fully covered by the training
data. In this work, we propose to train Random Forests upon spatially defined
local subspaces of the face. The output local predictions form a categorical
expression-driven high-level representation that we call Local Expression
Predictions (LEPs). LEPs can be combined to describe categorical facial
expressions as well as Action Units (AUs). Furthermore, LEPs can be weighted by
confidence scores provided by an autoencoder network. Such network is trained
to locally capture the manifold of the non-occluded training data in a
hierarchical way. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LEP
representation yields high descriptive power for categorical expressions and AU
occurrence prediction, and leads to interesting perspectives towards the design
of occlusion-robust and confidence-aware FER systems.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers networks where relationships between nodes are
represented by directed dissimilarities. The goal is to study methods that,
based on the dissimilarity structure, output hierarchical clusters, i.e., a
family of nested partitions indexed by a connectivity parameter. Our
construction of hierarchical clustering methods is built around the concept of
admissible methods, which are those that abide by the axioms of value - nodes
in a network with two nodes are clustered together at the maximum of the two
dissimilarities between them - and transformation - when dissimilarities are
reduced, the network may become more clustered but not less. Two particular
methods, termed reciprocal and nonreciprocal clustering, are shown to provide
upper and lower bounds in the space of admissible methods. Furthermore,
alternative clustering methodologies and axioms are considered. In particular,
modifying the axiom of value such that clustering in two-node networks occurs
at the minimum of the two dissimilarities entails the existence of a unique
admissible clustering method.

 <dc:description>  The popularity of distance education programs is increasing at a fast pace.
En par with this development, online communication in fora, social media and
reviewing platforms between students is increasing as well. Exploiting this
information to support fellow students or institutions requires to extract the
relevant opinions in order to automatically generate reports providing an
overview of pros and cons of different distance education programs. We report
on an experiment involving distance education experts with the goal to develop
a dataset of reviews annotated with relevant categories and aspects in each
category discussed in the specific review together with an indication of the
sentiment.
  Based on this experiment, we present an approach to extract general
categories and specific aspects under discussion in a review together with
their sentiment. We frame this task as a multi-label hierarchical text
classification problem and empirically investigate the performance of different
classification architectures to couple the prediction of a category with the
prediction of particular aspects in this category. We evaluate different
architectures and show that a hierarchical approach leads to superior results
in comparison to a flat model which makes decisions independently.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the coexistence between two key enabling technologies
for the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks, non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. Particularly, the
application of random beamforming to the addressed mmWave-NOMA scenario is
considered in this paper, in order to avoid the requirement that the base
station knows all the users' channel state information. Stochastic geometry is
used to characterize the performance of the proposed mmWave-NOMA transmission
scheme, by using the key features of mmWave systems, e.g., mmWave transmission
is highly directional and potential blockages will thin the user distribution.
Two random beamforming approaches which can further reduce the system overhead
are also proposed to the addressed mmWave-NOMA communication scenario, where
their performance is studied by developing analytical results about sum rates
and outage probabilities. Simulation results are also provided to demonstrate
the performance of the proposed mmWave-NOMA transmission schemes and verify the
accuracy of the developed analytical results.

 <dc:description>  Algorithms and implementations for computing the sign function of a
triangular matrix are fundamental building blocks in algorithms for computing
the sign of arbitrary square real or complex matrices. We present novel
recursive and cache efficient algorithms that are based on Higham's stabilized
specialization of Parlett's substitution algorithm for computing the sign of a
triangular matrix. We show that the new recursive algorithms are asymptotically
optimal in terms of the number of cache misses that they generate. One of the
novel algorithms that we present performs more arithmetic than the
non-recursive version, but this allows it to benefit from calling
highly-optimized matrix-multiplication routines; the other performs the same
number of operations as the non-recursive version, but it uses custom
computational kernels instead. We present implementations of both, as well as a
cache-efficient implementation of a block version of Parlett's algorithm. Our
experiments show that the blocked and recursive versions are much faster than
the previous algorithms, and that the inertia strongly influences their
relative performance, as predicted by our analysis.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Minimum Cost Multicut Formulations have been proposed and proven to
be successful in both motion trajectory segmentation and multi-target tracking
scenarios. Both tasks benefit from decomposing a graphical model into an
optimal number of connected components based on attractive and repulsive
pairwise terms. The two tasks are formulated on different levels of granularity
and, accordingly, leverage mostly local information for motion segmentation and
mostly high-level information for multi-target tracking. In this paper we argue
that point trajectories and their local relationships can contribute to the
high-level task of multi-target tracking and also argue that high-level cues
from object detection and tracking are helpful to solve motion segmentation. We
propose a joint graphical model for point trajectories and object detections
whose Multicuts are solutions to motion segmentation {\it and} multi-target
tracking problems at once. Results on the FBMS59 motion segmentation benchmark
as well as on pedestrian tracking sequences from the 2D MOT 2015 benchmark
demonstrate the promise of this joint approach.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm for segmentation of imperfect
boundary probability maps (BPM) in connectomics. Our algorithm can be a
considered as an extension of spectral clustering. Instead of clustering the
diffusion maps with traditional clustering algorithms, we learn the manifold
and compute an estimate of the minimum normalized cut. We proceed by divide and
conquer. We also introduce a novel criterion for determining if further splits
are necessary in a component based on it's topological properties. Our
algorithm complements the currently popular agglomeration approaches in
connectomics, which overlook the geometrical aspects of this segmentation
problem.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the last two decades, the growing trend of software development industry
has made different aspects of software engineering more interesting for the
computer science research community. Software development life-cycle is one of
these aspects that has a significant impact on the success/failure of software
development projects. Since each software development methodology relatively
provides its own software development life-cycle, encoding software development
life-cycle in a workflow representation language can help developers to
properly manage their software projects. In addition, such encoding can also be
used in CASE tools. In this report, we consider the software development
life-cycle as a workflow that can be represented by semantic web and rule based
languages. Such consideration let one analyze the properties of the life-cycle.
Specifically, we take a well-known agent oriented software development
methodology and show that its corresponding life-cycle can be specified by
Transaction Logic easily and concisely. Finally, the compact and clear
representation of the life-cycle in Transaction Logic can be used in CASE tools
to guide software developers.

 <dc:description>  In this doctoral thesis, we apply premises of cognitive linguistics to
terminological definitions and present a proposal called the flexible
terminological definition. This consists of a set of definitions of the same
concept made up of a general definition (in this case, one encompassing the
entire environmental domain) along with additional definitions describing the
concept from the perspective of the subdomains in which it is relevant. Since
context is a determining factor in the construction of the meaning of lexical
units (including terms), we assume that terminological definitions can, and
should, reflect the effects of context, even though definitions have
traditionally been treated as the expression of meaning void of any contextual
effect. The main objective of this thesis is to analyze the effects of
contextual variation on specialized environmental concepts with a view to their
representation in terminological definitions. Specifically, we focused on
contextual variation based on thematic restrictions. To accomplish the
objectives of this doctoral thesis, we conducted an empirical study consisting
of the analysis of a set of contextually variable concepts and the creation of
a flexible definition for two of them. As a result of the first part of our
empirical study, we divided our notion of domain-dependent contextual variation
into three different phenomena: modulation, perspectivization and
subconceptualization. These phenomena are additive in that all concepts
experience modulation, some concepts also undergo perspectivization, and
finally, a small number of concepts are additionally subjected to
subconceptualization. In the second part, we applied these notions to
terminological definitions and we presented we presented guidelines on how to
build flexible definitions, from the extraction of knowledge to the actual
writing of the definition.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop an agent-based model which integrates four
important elements, i.e. organisational energy management policies/regulations,
energy management technologies, electric appliances and equipment, and human
behaviour, based on a case study, to simulate the energy consumption in office
buildings. With the model, we test the effectiveness of different energy
management strategies, and solve practical office energy consumption problems.
This paper theoretically contributes to an integration of four elements
involved in the complex organisational issue of office energy consumption, and
practically contributes to an application of agent-based approach for office
building energy consumption study.

 <dc:description>  We design a new nonparametric method that allows one to estimate the matrix
of integrated kernels of a multivariate Hawkes process. This matrix not only
encodes the mutual influences of each nodes of the process, but also
disentangles the causality relationships between them. Our approach is the
first that leads to an estimation of this matrix without any parametric
modeling and estimation of the kernels themselves. A consequence is that it can
give an estimation of causality relationships between nodes (or users), based
on their activity timestamps (on a social network for instance), without
knowing or estimating the shape of the activities lifetime. For that purpose,
we introduce a moment matching method that fits the third-order integrated
cumulants of the process. We show on numerical experiments that our approach is
indeed very robust to the shape of the kernels, and gives appealing results on
the MemeTracker database.

 <dc:description>  This paper characterizes hierarchical clustering methods that abide by two
previously introduced axioms -- thus, denominated admissible methods -- and
proposes tractable algorithms for their implementation. We leverage the fact
that, for asymmetric networks, every admissible method must be contained
between reciprocal and nonreciprocal clustering, and describe three families of
intermediate methods. Grafting methods exchange branches between dendrograms
generated by different admissible methods. The convex combination family
combines admissible methods through a convex operation in the space of
dendrograms, and thirdly, the semi-reciprocal family clusters nodes that are
related by strong cyclic influences in the network. Algorithms for the
computation of hierarchical clusters generated by reciprocal and nonreciprocal
clustering as well as the grafting, convex combination, and semi-reciprocal
families are derived using matrix operations in a dioid algebra. Finally, the
introduced clustering methods and algorithms are exemplified through their
application to a network describing the interrelation between sectors of the
United States (U.S.) economy.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce two practical properties of hierarchical clustering methods for
(possibly asymmetric) network data: excisiveness and linear scale preservation.
The latter enforces imperviousness to change in units of measure whereas the
former ensures local consistency of the clustering outcome. Algorithmically,
excisiveness implies that we can reduce computational complexity by only
clustering a data subset of interest while theoretically guaranteeing that the
same hierarchical outcome would be observed when clustering the whole dataset.
Moreover, we introduce the concept of representability, i.e. a generative model
for describing clustering methods through the specification of their action on
a collection of networks. We further show that, within a rich set of admissible
methods, requiring representability is equivalent to requiring both
excisiveness and linear scale preservation. Leveraging this equivalence, we
show that all excisive and linear scale preserving methods can be factored into
two steps: a transformation of the weights in the input network followed by the
application of a canonical clustering method. Furthermore, their factorization
can be used to show stability of excisive and linear scale preserving methods
in the sense that a bounded perturbation in the input network entails a bounded
perturbation in the clustering output.

 <dc:description>  We study the influence of seasonally and geographically related daily
dynamics of daylight and ambient temperature on human resting or sleeping
patterns using mobile phone data of a large number of individuals. We observe
two daily inactivity periods in the people's aggregated mobile phone calling
patterns and infer these to represent the resting times of the population. We
find that the nocturnal resting period is strongly influenced by the length of
daylight, and that its seasonal variation depends on the latitude, such that
for people living in two different cities separated by eight latitudinal
degrees, the difference in the resting period of people between the summer and
winter in southern cities is almost twice that in the northern cities. We also
observe that the duration of the afternoon resting period is influenced by the
temperature, and that there is a threshold from which this influence sets in.
Finally, we observe that the yearly dynamics of the afternoon and nocturnal
resting periods appear to be counterbalancing each other. This also lends
support to the notion that the total daily resting time of people is more or
less conserved across the year.

 <dc:title>Data Scaling in OBDA Benchmarks: The VIG Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe VIG, a data scaler for benchmarks in the context of
ontology-based data access (OBDA). Data scaling is a relatively recent
approach, proposed in the database community, that allows for quickly scaling
up an input data instance to s times its size, while preserving certain
application-specific characteristics. The advantage of the approach is that the
user is not required to manually input the characteristics of the data to be
produced, making it particularly suitable for OBDA benchmarks, where the
complexity of database schemas might pose a challenge for manual input (e.g.,
the NPD benchmark contains 70 tables with some containing more than 60
columns). As opposed to a traditional data scaler, VIG includes domain
information provided by the OBDA mappings and the ontology in order to produce
data. VIG is currently used in the NPD benchmark, but it is not NPD-specific
and can be seeded with any data instance. The distinguishing features of VIG
are (1) its simple and clear generation strategy; (2) its efficiency, as each
value is generated in constant time, without accesses to the disk or to RAM to
retrieve previously generated values; (3) and its generality, as the data is
exported in CSV files that can be easily imported by any RDBMS system. VIG is a
java implementation licensed under Apache 2.0, and its source code is available
on GitHub (https://github.com/ontop/vig) in the form of a Maven project. The
code is being maintained since two years by the -ontop- team at the Free
University of Bozen-Bolzano.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of detecting zeros of continuous functions that are
known only up to an error bound, extending the earlier theoretical work with
explicit algorithms and experiments with an implementation. More formally, the
robustness of zero of a continuous map $f: X\to \mathbb{R}^n$ is the maximal
$r&gt;0$ such that each $g:X\to\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\|f-g\|_\infty\le r$ has a
zero. We develop and implement an efficient algorithm approximating the
robustness of zero. Further, we show how to use the algorithm for approximating
worst-case optima in optimization problems in which the feasible domain is
defined by equations that are only known approximately.
  An important ingredient is an algorithm for deciding the topological
extension problem based on computing cohomological obstructions to
extendability and their persistence. We describe an explicit algorithm for the
primary and secondary obstruction, two stages of a sequence of algorithms with
increasing complexity. We provide experimental evidence that for random
Gaussian fields, the primary obstruction---a much less computationally
demanding test than the secondary obstruction---is typically sufficient for
approximating robustness of zero.

 <dc:description>  Obstacle Detection is a central problem for any robotic system, and critical
for autonomous systems that travel at high speeds in unpredictable environment.
This is often achieved through scene depth estimation, by various means. When
fast motion is considered, the detection range must be longer enough to allow
for safe avoidance and path planning. Current solutions often make assumption
on the motion of the vehicle that limit their applicability, or work at very
limited ranges due to intrinsic constraints. We propose a novel
appearance-based Object Detection system that is able to detect obstacles at
very long range and at a very high speed (~300Hz), without making assumptions
on the type of motion. We achieve these results using a Deep Neural Network
approach trained on real and synthetic images and trading some depth accuracy
for fast, robust and consistent operation. We show how photo-realistic
synthetic images are able to solve the problem of training set dimension and
variety typical of machine learning approaches, and how our system is robust to
massive blurring of test images.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we analyze the performance of the uplink communication of
massive multi-cell multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems under the
effects of pilot contamination and delayed channels because of terminal
mobility. The base stations (BSs) estimate the channels through the uplink
training, and then use zero-forcing processing to decode the transmit signals
from the users. The probability density function (PDF) of the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio is derived for any finite number of
antennas. From this PDF, we derive an achievable ergodic rate with a finite
number of BS antennas in closed form. Insights of the impact of the Doppler
shift (due to terminal mobility) at the low signal-to-noise ratio regimes are
exposed. In addition, the effects on the outage probability are investigated.
Furthermore, the power scaling law and the asymptotic performance result by
infinitely increasing the numbers of antennas and terminals (while their ratio
is fixed) are provided. The numerical results demonstrate the performance loss
for various Doppler shifts. Among the interesting observations revealed is that
massive MIMO is favorable even in channel aging conditions.

 <dc:description>  Over the years, hand gesture recognition has been mostly addressed
considering hand trajectories in isolation. However, in most sign languages,
hand gestures are defined on a particular context (body region). We propose a
pipeline to perform sign language recognition which models hand movements in
the context of other parts of the body captured in the 3D space using the MS
Kinect sensor. In addition, we perform sign recognition based on the different
hand postures that occur during a sign. Our experiments show that considering
different body parts brings improved performance when compared to other methods
which only consider global hand trajectories. Finally, we demonstrate that the
combination of hand postures features with hand gestures features helps to
improve the prediction of a given sign.

personal health information. For sleep studies using data from social media,
most researchers focused on inferring sleep-related artifacts from
self-reported anecdotal pointers to sleep patterns or issues such as insomnia.
The data shared by &quot;quantified-selfers&quot; on social media presents an opportunity
to study more quantitative and objective measures of sleep. We propose and
validate the approach of collecting and analyzing sleep logs that are generated
and shared through a sleep-tracking mobile application. We highlight the value
of this data by combining it with users' social media data. The results provide
a validation of using social media for sleep studies as the collected sleep
data is aligned with sleep data from other sources. The results of combining
social media data with sleep data provide preliminary evidence that higher
social media activity is associated with lower sleep duration and quality.

 <dc:title>Distributed Supervised Learning using Neural Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Distributed learning is the problem of inferring a function in the case where
training data is distributed among multiple geographically separated sources.
Particularly, the focus is on designing learning strategies with low
computational requirements, in which communication is restricted only to
neighboring agents, with no reliance on a centralized authority. In this
thesis, we analyze multiple distributed protocols for a large number of neural
network architectures. The first part of the thesis is devoted to a definition
of the problem, followed by an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art.
Next, we introduce different strategies for a relatively simple class of single
layer neural networks, where a linear output layer is preceded by a nonlinear
layer, whose weights are stochastically assigned in the beginning of the
learning process. We consider both batch and sequential learning, with
horizontally and vertically partitioned data. In the third part, we consider
instead the more complex problem of semi-supervised distributed learning, where
each agent is provided with an additional set of unlabeled training samples. We
propose two different algorithms based on diffusion processes for linear
support vector machines and kernel ridge regression. Subsequently, the fourth
part extends the discussion to learning with time-varying data (e.g.
time-series) using recurrent neural networks. We consider two different
families of networks, namely echo state networks (extending the algorithms
introduced in the second part), and spline adaptive filters. Overall, the
algorithms presented throughout the thesis cover a wide range of possible
practical applications, and lead the way to numerous future extensions, which
are briefly summarized in the conclusive chapter.

 <dc:title>Interleaving Optimization with Sampling-Based Motion Planning (IOS-MP):
  Combining Local Optimization with Global Exploration</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Computing globally optimal motion plans for a robot is challenging in part
because it requires analyzing a robot's configuration space simultaneously from
both a macroscopic viewpoint (i.e., considering paths in multiple homotopic
classes) and a microscopic viewpoint (i.e., locally optimizing path quality).
We introduce Interleaved Optimization with Sampling-based Motion Planning
(IOS-MP), a new method that effectively combines global exploration and local
optimization to quickly compute high quality motion plans. Our approach
combines two paradigms: (1) asymptotically-optimal sampling-based motion
planning, which is effective at global exploration but relatively slow at
locally refining paths, and (2) optimization-based motion planning, which
locally optimizes paths quickly but lacks a global view of the configuration
space. IOS-MP iteratively alternates between global exploration and local
optimization, sharing information between the two, to improve motion planning
efficiency. We evaluate IOS-MP as it scales with respect to dimensionality and
complexity, as well as demonstrate its effectiveness on a 7-DOF manipulator for
tasks specified using goal configurations and workspace goal regions.

 <dc:title>Aggregation Architecture for Data Reduction and Privacy in Advanced

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) have rapidly become a topic of
international interest as governments have sponsored their deployment for the
purposes of utility service reliability and efficiency, e.g., water and
electricity conservation. Two problems plague such deployments. First is the
protection of consumer privacy. Second is the problem of huge amounts of data
from such deployments. A new architecture is proposed to address these problems
through the use of Aggregators, which incorporate temporary data buffering and
the modularization of utility grid analysis. These Aggregators are used to
deliver anonymized summary data to the central utility while preserving billing
and automated connection services.

 <dc:description>  The capacity of a graph is defined as the rate of exponential growth of
independent sets in the strong powers of the graph. In the strong power an edge
connects two sequences if at each position their letters are equal or adjacent.
We consider a variation of the problem where edges in the power graphs are
removed between sequences which differ in more than a fraction $\delta$ of
coordinates. The proposed generalization can be interpreted as the problem of
determining the highest rate of zero undetected-error communication over a link
with adversarial noise, where only a fraction $\delta$ of symbols can be
perturbed and only some substitutions are allowed.
  We derive lower bounds on achievable rates by combining graph homomorphisms
with a graph-theoretic generalization of the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. We then
give an upper bound, based on Delsarte's linear programming approach, which
combines Lov\'asz' theta function with the construction used by McEliece et al.
for bounding the minimum distance of codes in Hamming spaces.

 <dc:description>  We present a study of the influence of dispersion induced phase noise for
CO-OFDM systems using FFT multiplexing/IFFT demultiplexing techniques (software
based). The software based system provides a method for a rigorous evaluation
of the phase noise variance caused by Common Phase Error (CPE) and
Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) including - for the first time to our
knowledge - in explicit form the effect of equalization enhanced phase noise
(EEPN). This, in turns, leads to an analytic BER specification. Numerical
results focus on a CO-OFDM system with 10-25 GS/s QPSK channel modulation. A
worst case constellation configuration is identified for the phase noise
influence and the resulting BER is compared to the BER of a conventional single
channel QPSK system with the same capacity as the CO-OFDM implementation.
Results are evaluated as a function of transmission distance. For both types of
systems, the phase noise variance increases significantly with increasing
transmission distance. For a total capacity of 400 (1000) Gbit/s, the
transmission distance to have the BER &lt; 10^-2 for the worst case CO-OFDM design
is less than 800 and 460 km, respectively, whereas for a single channel QPSK
system it is less than 1400 and 560 km.

We analyze their battery properties and state of charge while charging, and
reveal the characteristics of different components of their power management
systems: charging mechanisms, state of charge estimation techniques, and their
battery properties. We explore diverse charging behavior of devices and their
users.

 <dc:description>  Structural regularities in man-made environments reflect in the distribution
of their surface normals. Describing these surface normal distributions is
important in many computer vision applications, such as scene understanding,
plane segmentation, and regularization of 3D reconstructions. Based on the
small-variance limit of Bayesian nonparametric von-Mises-Fisher (vMF) mixture
distributions, we propose two new flexible and efficient k-means-like
clustering algorithms for directional data such as surface normals. The first,
DP-vMF-means, is a batch clustering algorithm derived from the Dirichlet
process (DP) vMF mixture. Recognizing the sequential nature of data collection
in many applications, we extend this algorithm to DDP-vMF-means, which infers
temporally evolving cluster structure from streaming data. Both algorithms
naturally respect the geometry of directional data, which lies on the unit
sphere. We demonstrate their performance on synthetic directional data and real
3D surface normals from RGB-D sensors. While our experiments focus on 3D data,
both algorithms generalize to high dimensional directional data such as protein
backbone configurations and semantic word vectors.

 <dc:description>  Action recognition has received increasing attention from the computer vision
and machine learning communities in the last decade. To enable the study of
this problem, there exist a vast number of action datasets, which are recorded
under controlled laboratory settings, real-world surveillance environments, or
crawled from the Internet. Apart from the &quot;in-the-wild&quot; datasets, the training
and test split of conventional datasets often possess similar environments
conditions, which leads to close to perfect performance on constrained
datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset, namely Multi-Camera Action
Dataset (MCAD), which is designed to evaluate the open view classification
problem under the surveillance environment. In total, MCAD contains 14,298
action samples from 18 action categories, which are performed by 20 subjects
and independently recorded with 5 cameras. Inspired by the well received
evaluation approach on the LFW dataset, we designed a standard evaluation
protocol and benchmarked MCAD under several scenarios. The benchmark shows that
while an average of 85% accuracy is achieved under the closed-view scenario,
the performance suffers from a significant drop under the cross-view scenario.
In the worst case scenario, the performance of 10-fold cross validation drops
from 87.0% to 47.4%.

 <dc:description>  Understanding human actions in wild videos is an important task with a broad
range of applications. In this paper we propose a novel approach named
Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN), which enables to incorporate static
spatial information, short-term motion information and long-term video temporal
structures for complex human action understanding. Compared to recent
convolutional neural network based approaches, HAN has following advantages (1)
HAN can efficiently capture video temporal structures in a longer range; (2)
HAN is able to reveal temporal transitions between frame chunks with different
time steps, i.e. it explicitly models the temporal transitions between frames
as well as video segments and (3) with a multiple step spatial temporal
attention mechanism, HAN automatically learns important regions in video frames
and temporal segments in the video. The proposed model is trained and evaluated
on the standard video action benchmarks, i.e., UCF-101 and HMDB-51, and it
significantly outperforms the state-of-the arts

 <dc:title>On the Exploitation of Admittance Measurements for Wired Network

 <dc:creator>Passerini, Federico</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The knowledge of the topology of a wired network is often of fundamental
importance. For instance, in the context of Power Line Communications (PLC)
networks it is helpful to implement data routing strategies, while in power
distribution networks and Smart Micro Grids (SMG) it is required for grid
monitoring and for power flow management. In this paper, we use the
transmission line theory to shed new light and to show how the topological
properties of a wired network can be found exploiting admittance measurements
at the nodes. An analytic proof is reported to show that the derivation of the
topology can be done in complex networks under certain assumptions. We also
analyze the effect of the network background noise on admittance measurements.
In this respect, we propose a topology derivation algorithm that works in the
presence of noise. We finally analyze the performance of the algorithm using
values that are typical of power line distribution networks.

 <dc:description>  Existing Location-based social networks (LBSNs), e.g., Foursquare, depend
mainly on GPS or cellular-based localization to infer users' locations.
However, GPS is unavailable indoors and cellular-based localization provides
coarse-grained accuracy. This limits the accuracy of current LBSNs in indoor
environments, where people spend 89% of their time. This in turn affects the
user experience, in terms of the accuracy of the ranked list of venues,
especially for the small screens of mobile devices; misses business
opportunities; and leads to reduced venues coverage.
  In this paper, we present CheckInside: a system that can provide a
fine-grained indoor location-based social network. CheckInside leverages the
crowd-sensed data collected from users' mobile devices during the check-in
operation and knowledge extracted from current LBSNs to associate a place with
a logical name and a semantic fingerprint. This semantic fingerprint is used to
obtain a more accurate list of nearby places as well as to automatically detect
new places with similar signature. A novel algorithm for detecting fake
check-ins and inferring a semantically-enriched floorplan is proposed as well
as an algorithm for enhancing the system performance based on the user implicit
feedback. Furthermore, CheckInside encompasses a coverage extender module to
automatically predict names of new venues increasing the coverage of current
LBSNs.
  Experimental evaluation of CheckInside in four malls over the course of six
weeks with 20 participants shows that it can infer the actual user place within
the top five venues 99% of the time. This is compared to 17% only in the case
of current LBSNs. In addition, it increases the coverage of existing LBSNs by
more than 37%.

 <dc:description>  The unrelenting increase in the population of mobile users and their traffic
demands drive cellular network operators to densify their network
infrastructure. Network densification shrinks the footprint of base stations
(BSs) and reduces the number of users associated with each BS, leading to an
improved spatial frequency reuse and spectral efficiency, and thus, higher
network capacity. However, the densification gain come at the expense of higher
handover rates and network control overhead. Hence, users mobility can diminish
or even nullifies the foreseen densification gain. In this context, splitting
the control plane (C-plane) and user plane (U-plane) is proposed as a potential
solution to harvest densification gain with reduced cost in terms of handover
rate and network control overhead. In this article, we use stochastic geometry
to develop a tractable mobility-aware model for a two-tier downlink cellular
network with ultra-dense small cells and C-plane/U-plane split architecture.
The developed model is then used to quantify the effect of mobility on the
foreseen densification gain with and without C-plane/U-plane split. To this
end, we shed light on the handover problem in dense cellular environments, show
scenarios where the network fails to support certain mobility profiles, and
obtain network design insights.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the notion of perturbation resilience introduced by Bilu and Linial
(2010) and Awasthi, Blum, and Sheffet (2012). A clustering problem is
$\alpha$-perturbation resilient if the optimal clustering does not change when
we perturb all distances by a factor of at most $\alpha$. We consider a class
of clustering problems with center-based objectives, which includes such
problems as k-means, k-median, and k-center, and give an exact algorithm for
clustering 2-perturbation resilient instances. Our result improves upon the
result of Balcan and Liang (2016), who gave an algorithm for clustering
$1+\sqrt{2}\approx 2.41$ perturbation resilient instances. Our result is tight
in the sense that no polynomial-time algorithm can solve
$(2-\varepsilon)$-perturbation resilient instances unless NP = RP, as was shown
by Balcan, Haghtalab, and White (2016). We show that the algorithm works on
instances satisfying a slightly weaker and more natural condition than
perturbation resilience, which we call metric perturbation resilience.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that any graph admits a crossing-free straight-line drawing
in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and that any planar graph admits the same even in
$\mathbb{R}^2$. For a graph $G$ and $d \in \{2,3\}$, let $\rho^1_d(G)$ denote
the minimum number of lines in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that together can cover all edges
of a drawing of $G$. For $d=2$, $G$ must be planar. We investigate the
complexity of computing these parameters and obtain the following hardness and
algorithmic results.
  - For $d\in\{2,3\}$, we prove that deciding whether $\rho^1_d(G)\le k$ for a
given graph $G$ and integer $k$ is ${\exists\mathbb{R}}$-complete.
  - Since $\mathrm{NP}\subseteq{\exists\mathbb{R}}$, deciding $\rho^1_d(G)\le
k$ is NP-hard for $d\in\{2,3\}$. On the positive side, we show that the problem
is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $k$.
  - Since ${\exists\mathbb{R}}\subseteq\mathrm{PSPACE}$, both $\rho^1_2(G)$ and
$\rho^1_3(G)$ are computable in polynomial space. On the negative side, we show
that drawings that are optimal with respect to $\rho^1_2$ or $\rho^1_3$
sometimes require irrational coordinates.
  - Let $\rho^2_3(G)$ be the minimum number of planes in $\mathbb{R}^3$ needed
to cover a straight-line drawing of a graph $G$. We prove that deciding whether
$\rho^2_3(G)\le k$ is NP-hard for any fixed $k \ge 2$. Hence, the problem is
not fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $k$ unless
$\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{NP}$.

 <dc:description>  Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive.
One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the
neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the
distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training
cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the
summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces
the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch
normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to
apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch
normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used
for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a
single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its
own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before
the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs
exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also
straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the
normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is
very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.
Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the
training time compared with previously published techniques.

 <dc:description>  We use Pontryagin's minimum principle to optimize variational quantum
algorithms. We show that for a fixed computation time, the optimal evolution
has a bang-bang (square pulse) form, both for closed and open quantum systems
with Markovian decoherence. Our findings support the choice of evolution ansatz
in the recently proposed Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Focusing
on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass as an example, we find a system-size
independent distribution of the duration of pulses, with characteristic time
scale set by the inverse of the coupling constants in the Hamiltonian. The
optimality of the bang-bang protocols and the characteristic time scale of the
pulses provide an efficient parameterization of the protocol and inform the
search for effective hybrid (classical and quantum) schemes for tackling
combinatorial optimization problems. For the particular systems we study, we
find numerically that the optimal nonadiabatic bang-bang protocols outperform
conventional quantum annealing in the presence of weak white additive external
noise and weak coupling to a thermal bath modeled with the Redfield master
equation.

 <dc:description>  We consider an agent trying to bring a system to an acceptable state by
repeated probabilistic action. Several recent works on algorithmizations of the
Lovasz Local Lemma (LLL) can be seen as establishing sufficient conditions for
the agent to succeed. Here we study whether such stochastic control is also
possible in a noisy environment, where both the process of state-observation
and the process of state-evolution are subject to adversarial perturbation
(noise). The introduction of noise causes the tools developed for LLL
algorithmization to break down since the key LLL ingredient, the sparsity of
the causality (dependence) relationship, no longer holds. To overcome this
challenge we develop a new analysis where entropy plays a central role, both to
measure the rate at which progress towards an acceptable state is made and the
rate at which noise undoes this progress. The end result is a sufficient
condition that allows a smooth tradeoff between the intensity of the noise and
the amenability of the system, recovering an asymmetric LLL condition in the
noiseless case.

 <dc:description>  We introduce and study the Doubly Balanced Connected graph Partitioning
(DBCP) problem: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a connected graph with a weight
(supply/demand) function $p:V\rightarrow \{-1,+1\}$ satisfying $p(V)=\sum_{j\in
V} p(j)=0$. The objective is to partition $G$ into $(V_1,V_2)$ such that
$G[V_1]$ and $G[V_2]$ are connected, $|p(V_1)|,|p(V_2)|\leq c_p$, and
$\max\{\frac{|V_1|}{|V_2|},\frac{|V_2|}{|V_1|}\}\leq c_s$, for some constants
$c_p$ and $c_s$. When $G$ is 2-connected, we show that a solution with $c_p=1$
and $c_s=3$ always exists and can be found in polynomial time. Moreover, when
$G$ is 3-connected, we show that there is always a `perfect' solution (a
partition with $p(V_1)=p(V_2)=0$ and $|V_1|=|V_2|$, if $|V|\equiv 0
(\mathrm{mod}~4)$), and it can be found in polynomial time. Our techniques can
be extended, with similar results, to the case in which the weights are
arbitrary (not necessarily $\pm 1$), and to the case that $p(V)\neq 0$ and the
excess supply/demand should be split evenly. They also apply to the problem of
partitioning a graph with two types of nodes into two large connected subgraphs
that preserve approximately the proportion of the two types.

 <dc:description>  We study the fundamental problem of assigning resources to maximize their
expected utilization.This kind of problem arises in many settings, where it is
in the interest of a group, the general public, or a principal, that assigned
resources be used and not wasted. At the time of assigning resources, each
agent privately holds information about her distribution on future values for
different assignments. Subsequently, we allow for payments to be contingent on
ex post utilization decisions. The objective is to maximize expected
utilization, while insisting on dominant-strategy equilibria, individual
rationality, and no-deficit. We also consider two additional, natural
properties: an agent should not pay if she utilizes a resource, and resources
should always be assigned if possible. We show that the natural, contingent
second-price (CSP) mechanism, is unique under these criteria and optimal for a
larger class of mechanisms for assigning a single resource. We extend the CSP
mechanism to assign multiple, heterogeneous resources (making a technical
connection with assignment problems under non quasi-linear utility functions),
showing that this generalized mechanism outperforms other methods such as
first-come-first-serve and the VCG mechanism.

 <dc:description>  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are playing important roles in
state-of-the-art visual recognition. This paper focuses on modeling the spatial
co-occurrence of neuron responses, which is less studied in the previous work.
For this, we consider the neurons in the hidden layer as neural words, and
construct a set of geometric neural phrases on top of them. The idea that
grouping neural words into neural phrases is borrowed from the
Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model. Next, the Geometric Neural Phrase Pooling
(GNPP) algorithm is proposed to efficiently encode these neural phrases. GNPP
acts as a new type of hidden layer, which punishes the isolated neuron
responses after convolution, and can be inserted into a CNN model with little
extra computational overhead. Experimental results show that GNPP produces
significant and consistent accuracy gain in image classification.

 <dc:title>The Role of PMESII Modeling in a Continuous Cycle of Anticipation and

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The inevitable incompleteness of any collection of PMESII models, along with
poorly understood methods for combining heterogeneous models, leads to major
uncertainty regarding the reliability of computational tools. This uncertainty
is further exacerbated by difficulties in validation of such tools. They should
only be used as aids to human analysis and decision-making. A practitioner must
wonder: how can we accommodate the uncertainty of a tool's results by applying
human judgment appropriately?
  In this paper, we describe two examples where planners and analysts used (or
could have used) computational tools to obtain estimates of effects of various
actions under consideration. Then they considered these computational estimates
to draw their own conclusions regarding the effects that would likely emerge
from proposed actions taken by the international mission.
  The key idea, in both of our examples, is a continuous cycle of anticipations
and actions; in each cycle computational estimates of effects help intervention
managers determine appropriate actions, and then assessments of real-world
outcomes guide the next increment of computational estimates. With a proper
methodology, PMESII modeling tools can offer valuable insights and encourage
learning, even if they will never produce fully accurate estimates useable in a
customary, strictly predictive manner.

 <dc:title>HyperLogLog Hyper Extended: Sketches for Concave Sublinear Frequency
  Statistics</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cohen, Edith</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the most common statistics computed over data elements is the number
of distinct keys. A thread of research pioneered by Flajolet and Martin three
decades ago culminated in the design of optimal approximate counting sketches,
which have size that is double logarithmic in the number of distinct keys and
provide estimates with a small relative error. Moreover, the sketches are
composable, and thus suitable for streamed, parallel, or distributed
computation.
  We consider here all statistics of the frequency distribution of keys, where
a contribution of a key to the aggregate is concave and grows (sub)linearly
with its frequency. These fundamental aggregations are very common in text,
graphs, and logs analysis and include logarithms, low frequency moments, and
capping statistics.
  We design composable sketches of double-logarithmic size for all concave
sublinear statistics. Our design combines theoretical optimality and practical
simplicity. In a nutshell, we specify tailored mapping functions of data
elements to output elements so that our target statistics on the data elements
is approximated by the (max-) distinct statistics of the output elements, which
can be approximated using off-the-shelf sketches. Our key insight is relating
these target statistics to the {\em complement Laplace} transform of the input
frequencies.

 <dc:description>  The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases
present in data. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular
framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine
learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word
embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender
stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their
widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases.
Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the
word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable
from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we
provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes,
such as the association between between the words receptionist and female,
while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and
female. We define metrics to quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in
embeddings, and develop algorithms to &quot;debias&quot; the embedding. Using
crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically
demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings
while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster
related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be
used in applications without amplifying gender bias.

 <dc:description>  Mobile cloud computing enables the offloading of computationally heavy
applications, such as for gaming, object recognition or video processing, from
mobile users (MUs) to cloudlet or cloud servers, which are connected to
wireless access points, either directly or through finite-capacity backhaul
links. In this paper, the design of a mobile cloud computing system is
investigated by proposing the joint optimization of computing and communication
resources with the aim of minimizing the energy required for offloading across
all MUs under latency constraints at the application layer. The proposed design
accounts for multiantenna uplink and downlink interfering transmissions, with
or without cooperation on the downlink, along with the allocation of backhaul
and computational resources and user selection. The resulting design
optimization problems are nonconvex, and stationary solutions are computed by
means of successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Numerical results
illustrate the advantages in terms of energy-latency trade-off of the joint
optimization of computing and communication resources, as well as the impact of
system parameters, such as backhaul capacity, and of the network architecture.

 <dc:description>  Handling imbalanced datasets is a challenging problem that if not treated
correctly results in reduced classification performance. Imbalanced datasets
are commonly handled using minority oversampling, whereas the SMOTE algorithm
is a successful oversampling algorithm with numerous extensions. SMOTE
extensions do not have a theoretical guarantee during training to work better
than SMOTE and in many instances their performance is data dependent. In this
paper we propose a novel extension to the SMOTE algorithm with a theoretical
guarantee for improved classification performance. The proposed approach
considers the classification performance of both the majority and minority
classes. In the proposed approach CGMOS (Certainty Guided Minority
OverSampling) new data points are added by considering certainty changes in the
dataset. The paper provides a proof that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed
to work better than SMOTE for training data. Further experimental results on 30
real-world datasets show that CGMOS works better than existing algorithms when
using 6 different classifiers.

 <dc:description>  Word embedding methods revolve around learning continuous distributed vector
representations of words with neural networks, which can capture semantic
and/or syntactic cues, and in turn be used to induce similarity measures among
words, sentences and documents in context. Celebrated methods can be
categorized as prediction-based and count-based methods according to the
training objectives and model architectures. Their pros and cons have been
extensively analyzed and evaluated in recent studies, but there is relatively
less work continuing the line of research to develop an enhanced learning
method that brings together the advantages of the two model families. In
addition, the interpretation of the learned word representations still remains
somewhat opaque. Motivated by the observations and considering the pressing
need, this paper presents a novel method for learning the word representations,
which not only inherits the advantages of classic word embedding methods but
also offers a clearer and more rigorous interpretation of the learned word
representations. Built upon the proposed word embedding method, we further
formulate a translation-based language modeling framework for the extractive
speech summarization task. A series of empirical evaluations demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed word representation learning and language
modeling techniques in extractive speech summarization.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel algorithm to design user load-achieving pilot sequences
that mitigate pilot contamination in multi-cell massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) networks. To this end, we first derive expressions for
the user load and the load region of the network considering both small-scale
and large-scale propagation effects. We then develop the pilot sequence
algorithm for multi-cell massive MIMO networks as per the rules of generalized
Welch bound equality design. Notably, we find that our algorithm and the
corresponding downlink power allocation ensure that the user load is achieved
when the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements for the
users lie within the load region. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance
advantage of our proposed design relative to the existing designs, in terms of
a larger load region and a higher maximum permitted SINR. Finally, we show that
our proposed design can satisfy the pre-defined SINR requirements for users
with a finite number of antennas at the base station (BS), while the existing
designs cannot satisfy the same requirements even with an infinite number of
antennas at the BS.

 <dc:description>  Graph algorithms are increasingly used in applications that exploit large
databases. However, conventional processor architectures are inadequate for
handling the throughput and memory requirements of graph computation. Lincoln
Laboratory's graph-processor architecture represents a rethinking of parallel
architectures for graph problems. Our processor utilizes innovations that
include a sparse matrix-based graph instruction set, a cacheless memory system,
accelerator-based architecture, a systolic sorter, high-bandwidth
multi-dimensional toroidal communication network, and randomized
communications. A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) prototype of the new
graph processor has been developed with significant performance enhancement
over conventional processors in graph computational throughput.

 <dc:description>  The map-reduce parallel programming model has become extremely popular in the
big data community. Many big data workloads can benefit from the enhanced
performance offered by supercomputers. LLMapReduce provides the familiar
map-reduce parallel programming model to big data users running on a
supercomputer. LLMapReduce dramatically simplifies map-reduce programming by
providing simple parallel programming capability in one line of code.
LLMapReduce supports all programming languages and many schedulers. LLMapReduce
can work with any application without the need to modify the application.
Furthermore, LLMapReduce can overcome scaling limits in the map-reduce parallel
programming model via options that allow the user to switch to the more
efficient single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) parallel programming model. These
features allow users to reduce the computational overhead by more than 10x
compared to standard map-reduce for certain applications. LLMapReduce is widely
used by hundreds of users at MIT. Currently LLMapReduce works with several
schedulers such as SLURM, Grid Engine and LSF.

 <dc:description>  Job schedulers are a key component of scalable computing infrastructures.
They orchestrate all of the work executed on the computing infrastructure and
directly impact the effectiveness of the system. Recently, job workloads have
diversified from long-running, synchronously-parallel simulations to include
short-duration, independently parallel high performance data analysis (HPDA)
jobs. Each of these job types requires different features and scheduler tuning
to run efficiently. A number of schedulers have been developed to address both
job workload and computing system heterogeneity. High performance computing
(HPC) schedulers were designed to schedule large-scale scientific modeling and
simulations on supercomputers. Big Data schedulers were designed to schedule
data processing and analytic jobs on clusters. This paper compares and
contrasts the features of HPC and Big Data schedulers with a focus on
accommodating both scientific computing and high performance data analytic
workloads. Job latency is critical for the efficient utilization of scalable
computing infrastructures, and this paper presents the results of job launch
benchmarking of several current schedulers: Slurm, Son of Grid Engine, Mesos,
and Yarn. We find that all of these schedulers have low utilization for
short-running jobs. Furthermore, employing multilevel scheduling significantly
improves the utilization across all schedulers.

 <dc:description>  Introducing attentional mechanism in neural network is a powerful concept,
and has achieved impressive results in many natural language processing tasks.
However, most of the existing models impose attentional distribution on a flat
topology, namely the entire input representation sequence. Clearly, any
well-formed sentence has its accompanying syntactic tree structure, which is a
much rich topology. Applying attention to such topology not only exploits the
underlying syntax, but also makes attention more interpretable. In this paper,
we explore this direction in the context of natural language inference. The
results demonstrate its efficacy. We also perform extensive qualitative
analysis, deriving insights and intuitions of why and how our model works.

 <dc:description>  Background: There has been growing research interest in automated answering
of questions or generation of summary of free form text such as news article.
In order to implement this task, the computer should be able to identify the
sequence of events, duration of events, time at which event occurred and the
relationship type between event pairs, time pairs or event-time pairs. Specific
Problem: It is important to accurately identify the relationship type between
combinations of event and time before the temporal ordering of events can be
defined. The machine learning approach taken in Mani et. al (2006) provides an
accuracy of only 62.5 on the baseline data from TimeBank. The researchers used
maximum entropy classifier in their methodology. TimeML uses the TLINK
annotation to tag a relationship type between events and time. The time
complexity is quadratic when it comes to tagging documents with TLINK using
human annotation. This research proposes using decision tree and parsing to
improve the relationship type tagging. This research attempts to solve the gaps
in human annotation by automating the task of relationship type tagging in an
attempt to improve the accuracy of event and time relationship in annotated
documents. Scope information: The documents from the domain of news will be
used. The tagging will be performed within the same document and not across
documents. The relationship types will be identified only for a pair of event
and time and not a chain of events. The research focuses on documents tagged
using the TimeML specification which contains tags such as EVENT, TLINK, and
TIMEX. Each tag has attributes such as identifier, relation, POS, time etc.

 <dc:description>  Social influence cannot be identified from purely observational data on
social networks, because such influence is generically confounded with latent
homophily, i.e., with a node's network partners being informative about the
node's attributes and therefore its behavior. We show that {\em if} the network
grows according to either a community (stochastic block) model, or a continuous
latent space model, then latent homophilous attributes can be consistently
estimated from the global pattern of social ties. Moreover, these estimates are
informative enough that controlling for them allows for unbiased and consistent
estimation of social-influence effects in additive models. For community
models, we also provide bounds on the finite-sample bias. These are the first
results on the consistent estimation of social-influence effects in the
presence of latent homophily, and we discuss the prospects for generalizing
them.

 <dc:description>  Energy storage systems (ESSs) are essential components of the future smart
grid to smooth out the fluctuating output of renewable energy generators.
However, installing large number of ESSs for individual energy consumers may
not be practically implementable, due to both the space limitation and high
investment cost. As a result, in this paper, we study the energy management
problem of multiple users with renewable energy sources and a single shared
ESS. To solve this problem, we propose an algorithm that jointly optimizes the
energy charged/discharged to/from the shared ESS given a profit coefficient set
that specifies the desired proportion of the total profit allocated to each
user, subject to practical constraints of the system. We conduct simulations
based on the real data from California, US, and show that the shared ESS can
potentially increase the total profit of all users by 10% over the case that
users own individual small-scale ESSs with no energy sharing.

 <dc:description>  Recently, machine learning techniques especially predictive modeling and
pattern recognition in biomedical sciences from drug delivery system to medical
imaging has become one of the important methods which are assisting researchers
to have deeper understanding of entire issue and to solve complex medical
problems. Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in
classification while extracting low to high-level features. In this paper, we
used convolutional neural network to classify Alzheimer's brain from normal
healthy brain. The importance of classifying this kind of medical data is to
potentially develop a predict model or system in order to recognize the type
disease from normal subjects or to estimate the stage of the disease.
Classification of clinical data such as Alzheimer's disease has been always
challenging and most problematic part has been always selecting the most
discriminative features. Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the
famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified structural MRI data of
Alzheimer's subjects from normal controls where the accuracy of test data on
trained data reached 98.84%. This experiment suggests us the shift and scale
invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification is
most powerful method to distinguish clinical data from healthy data in fMRI.
This approach also enables us to expand our methodology to predict more
complicated systems.

 <dc:description>  In gaming, customizing individual characters, can create personal bonds
between players and their characters. Hence, character customization is a
standard component in many games. While mobile Augmented Reality (AR) games
become popular, to date, no 3D character editor for AR games exists. We
investigate the feasibility of 3D character customization for smartphone-based
AR in an iterative design process.
  Specifically, we present findings from creating AR prototypes in a handheld
AR setting. In a first user study, we found that a tangible AR prototype
resulted in higher hedonistic measures than a camera-based approach. In a
follow up study, we compared the tangible AR prototype with a non-AR
touchscreen version for selection, scaling, translation and rotation tasks in a
3D character customization setting. The tangible AR version resulted in
significantly better results for stimulation and novelty measures than the
non-AR version. At the same time, it maintained a proficient level in pragmatic
measures such as accuracy and efficiency.

 <dc:description>  The causal discovery of Bayesian networks is an active and important research
area, and it is based upon searching the space of causal models for those which
can best explain a pattern of probabilistic dependencies shown in the data.
However, some of those dependencies are generated by causal structures
involving variables which have not been measured, i.e., latent variables. Some
such patterns of dependency &quot;reveal&quot; themselves, in that no model based solely
upon the observed variables can explain them as well as a model using a latent
variable. That is what latent variable discovery is based upon. Here we did a
search for finding them systematically, so that they may be applied in latent
variable discovery in a more rigorous fashion.

 <dc:description>  A basic task in bioinformatics is the counting of $k$-mers in genome strings.
The $k$-mer counting problem is to build a histogram of all substrings of
length $k$ in a given genome sequence. We present the open source $k$-mer
counting software Gerbil that has been designed for the efficient counting of
$k$-mers for $k\geq32$. Given the technology trend towards long reads of
next-generation sequencers, support for large $k$ becomes increasingly
important. While existing $k$-mer counting tools suffer from excessive memory
resource consumption or degrading performance for large $k$, Gerbil is able to
efficiently support large $k$ without much loss of performance. Our software
implements a two-disk approach. In the first step, DNA reads are loaded from
disk and distributed to temporary files that are stored at a working disk. In a
second step, the temporary files are read again, split into $k$-mers and
counted via a hash table approach. In addition, Gerbil can optionally use GPUs
to accelerate the counting step. For large $k$, we outperform state-of-the-art
open source $k$-mer counting tools for large genome data sets.

 <dc:description>  We present ARTist, a compiler-based application instrumentation solution for
Android. ARTist is based on the new ART runtime and the on-device dex2oat
compiler of Android, which replaced the interpreter-based managed runtime (DVM)
from Android version 5 onwards. Since dex2oat is yet uncharted, our approach
required first and foremost a thorough study of the compiler suite's internals
and in particular of the new default compiler backend Optimizing. We document
the results of this study in this paper to facilitate independent research on
this topic and exemplify the viability of ARTist by realizing two use cases.
Moreover, given that seminal works like TaintDroid hitherto depend on the now
abandoned DVM, we conduct a case study on whether taint tracking can be
re-instantiated using a compiler-based instrumentation framework. Overall, our
results provide compelling arguments for preferring compiler-based
instrumentation over alternative bytecode or binary rewriting approaches.

 <dc:description>  The low-power wireless bus (LWB) is a highly efficient communication protocol
for wireless sensor networks (WSN). However, a lack of open implementation for
this protocol prompted the implementation of the protocol for the most common
platform of WSN related research, the sky nodes using the Contiki operating
system. This document provides the detailed description of the implementation.
  A forwarder-selection mechanism is developed to improve energy-efficiency of
LWB in data collection scenario. The implementation also consists the forwarder
selection mechanism. One can either use the original features of LWB or enforce
the forwarder selection mechanism.

 <dc:description>  The OneMax problem is a standard benchmark optimisation problem for a binary
search space. Recent work on applying a Bandit-Based Random Mutation
Hill-Climbing algorithm to the noisy OneMax Problem showed that it is important
to choose a good value for the resampling number to make a careful trade off
between taking more samples in order to reduce noise, and taking fewer samples
to reduce the total computational cost. This paper extends that observation, by
deriving an analytical expression for the running time of the RMHC algorithm
with resampling applied to the noisy OneMax problem, and showing both
theoretically and empirically that the optimal resampling number increases with
the number of dimensions in the search space.

confirm the effectiveness of the polynomial beamformer design, which makes it a

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel support vector regression approach called e-Distance
Weighted Support Vector Regression (e-DWSVR).e-DWSVR specifically addresses two
challenging issues in support vector regression: first, the process of noisy
data; second, how to deal with the situation when the distribution of boundary
data is different from that of the overall data. The proposed e-DWSVR optimizes
the minimum margin and the mean of functional margin simultaneously to tackle
these two issues. In addition, we use both dual coordinate descent (CD) and
averaged stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) strategies to make e-DWSVR scalable
to large scale problems. We report promising results obtained by e-DWSVR in
comparison with existing methods on several benchmark datasets.

 <dc:description>  Service requesters with limited technical knowledge should be able to compare
services based on their quality of service (QoS) requirements in cloud service
marketplaces. Existing service matching approaches focus on QoS requirements as
discrete numeric values and intervals. The analysis of existing research on
non-functional properties reveals two improvement opportunities: list-typed QoS
properties as well as explicit handling of preferences for lower or higher
property values. We develop a concept and constraint models for a service
matcher which contributes to existing approaches by addressing these issues
using constraint solvers. The prototype uses an API at the standardisation
stage and discovers implementation challenges. This paper concludes that
constraint solvers provide a valuable tool to solve the service matching
problem with soft constraints and are capable of covering all QoS property
types in our analysis. Our approach is to be further investigated in the
application context of cloud federations.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we address the longest common extension (LCE) problem: to
compute the length $\ell$ of the longest common prefix between any two suffixes
of $T\in \Sigma^n$ with $ \Sigma = \{0, \ldots \sigma-1\} $. We present two
fast and space-efficient solutions based on (Karp-Rabin)
\textit{fingerprinting} and \textit{sampling}. Our first data structure
exploits properties of Mersenne prime numbers when used as moduli of the
Karp-Rabin hash function and takes $n\lceil \log_2\sigma\rceil$ bits of space.
Our second structure works with any prime modulus and takes $n\lceil
\log_2\sigma\rceil + n/w + w\log_2 n$ bits of space ($ w $ memory-word size).
Both structures support $\mathcal O\left(m\log\sigma/w \right)$-time extraction
of any length-$m$ text substring, $\mathcal O(\log\ell)$-time LCE queries with
high probability, and can be built in optimal $\mathcal O(n)$ time. In the
first case, ours is the first result showing that it is possible to answer LCE
queries in $o(n)$ time while using only $\mathcal O(1)$ words on top of the
space required to store the text. Our results improve the state of the art in
space usage, query times, and preprocessing times and are extremely practical:
we present a C++ implementation that is very fast and space-efficient in
practice.

 <dc:description>  In their seminal work, Mustafa and Ray (2009) showed that a wide class of
geometric set cover (SC) problems admit a PTAS via local search -- this is one
of the most general approaches known for such problems. Their result applies if
a naturally defined &quot;exchange graph&quot; for two feasible solutions is planar and
is based on subdividing this graph via a planar separator theorem due to
Frederickson (1987). Obtaining similar results for the related maximum
k-coverage problem (MC) seems non-trivial due to the hard cardinality
constraint. In fact, while Badanidiyuru, Kleinberg, and Lee (2012) have shown
(via a different analysis) that local search yields a PTAS for two-dimensional
real halfspaces, they only conjectured that the same holds true for dimension
three. Interestingly, at this point it was already known that local search
provides a PTAS for the corresponding set cover case and this followed directly
from the approach of Mustafa and Ray.
  In this work we provide a way to address the above-mentioned issue. First, we
propose a color-balanced version of the planar separator theorem. The resulting
subdivision approximates locally in each part the global distribution of the
colors. Second, we show how this roughly balanced subdivision can be employed
in a more careful analysis to strictly obey the hard cardinality constraint.
More specifically, we obtain a PTAS for any &quot;planarizable&quot; instance of MC and
thus essentially for all cases where the corresponding SC instance can be
tackled via the approach of Mustafa and Ray. As a corollary, we confirm the
conjecture of Badanidiyuru, Kleinberg, and Lee regarding real half spaces in
dimension three. We feel that our ideas could also be helpful in other
geometric settings involving a cardinality constraint.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel method for the compensation of long duration data gaps in
audio signals, in particular music. The concealment of such signal defects is
based on a graph that encodes signal structure in terms of time-persistent
spectral similarity. A suitable candidate segment for the substitution of the
lost content is proposed by an intuitive optimization scheme and smoothly
inserted into the gap. Extensive listening tests show that the proposed
algorithm provides highly promising results when applied to a variety of
real-world music signals.

 <dc:title>The Python user interface of the elsA cfd software: a coupling framework

 <dc:description>  The Python--elsA user interface of the elsA cfd (Computational Fluid
Dynamics) software has been developed to allow users to specify simulations
with confidence, through a global context of description objects grouped inside
scripts. The software main features are generated documentation, context
checking and completion, and helpful error management. Further developments
have used this foundation as a coupling framework, allowing (thanks to the
descriptive approach) the coupling of external algorithms with the cfd solver
in a simple and abstract way, leading to more success in complex simulations.
Along with the description of the technical part of the interface, we try to
gather the salient points pertaining to the psychological viewpoint of user
experience (ux). We point out the differences between user interfaces and pure
data management systems such as cgns.

 <dc:description>  Service matching concerns finding suitable services according to the service
requester's requirements, which is a complex task due to the increasing number
and diversity of cloud services available. Service matching is discussed in web
services composition and user oriented service marketplaces contexts. The
suggested approaches have different problem definitions and have to be examined
closer in order to identify comparable results and to find out which approaches
have built on the former ones. One of the most important use cases is service
requesters with limited technical knowledge who need to compare services based
on their QoS requirements in cloud service marketplaces. Our survey examines
the service matching approaches in order to find out the relation between their
context and their objectives. Moreover, it evaluates their applicability for
the cloud service marketplaces context.

 <dc:description>  Ceramic tiles have become very popular and are used in the flooring of
offices and shopping malls. As testing the quality of tiles manually in a
highly polluted environment in the manufacturing industry is a labor-intensive
and time consuming process, analysis is carried out on the tile images. This
paper discusses an automated system to detect the defects on the surface of
ceramic tiles based on dilation, erosion, SMEE and boundary detection
techniques.

 <dc:description>  Various Cloud layers have to work in concert in order to manage and deploy
complex multi-cloud applications, executing sophisticated workflows for Cloud
resource deployment, activation, adjustment, interaction, and monitoring. While
there are ample solutions for managing individual Cloud aspects (e.g. network
controllers, deployment tools, and application security software), there are no
well-integrated suites for managing an entire multi cloud environment with
multiple providers and deployment models. This paper presents the CYCLONE
architecture that integrates a number of existing solutions to create an open,
unified, holistic Cloud management platform for multi-cloud applications,
tailored to the needs of research organizations and SMEs. It discusses major
challenges in providing a network and security infrastructure for the
Intercloud and concludes with the demonstration how the architecture is
implemented in a real life bioinformatics use case.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of interpolating signals defined on graphs.
A major presumption considered by many previous approaches to this problem has
been lowpass/ band-limitedness of the underlying graph signal. However,
inspired by the findings on sparse signal reconstruction, we consider the graph
signal to be rather sparse/compressible in the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT)
domain and propose the Iterative Method with Adaptive Thresholding for Graph
Interpolation (IMATGI) algorithm for sparsity promoting interpolation of the
underlying graph signal.We analytically prove convergence of the proposed
algorithm. We also demonstrate efficient performance of the proposed IMATGI
algorithm in reconstructing randomly generated sparse graph signals. Finally,
we consider the widely desirable application of recommendation systems and show
by simulations that IMATGI outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on the
benchmark datasets in this application.

 <dc:description>  Consider a graph having quantum systems lying at each node. Suppose that the
whole thing evolves in discrete time steps, according to a global, unitary
causal operator. By causal we mean that information can only propagate at a
bounded speed, with respect to the distance given by the graph. Suppose,
moreover, that the graph itself is subject to the evolution, and may be driven
to be in a quantum superposition of graphs---in accordance to the superposition
principle. We show that these unitary causal operators must decompose as a
finite-depth circuit of local unitary gates. This unifies a result on Quantum
Cellular Automata with another on Reversible Causal Graph Dynamics. Along the
way we formalize a notion of causality which is valid in the context of quantum
superpositions of time-varying graphs, and has a number of good properties.

 <dc:description>  Real-time parking occupancy information is valuable for guiding drivers'
searching for parking spaces. Recently many parking detection systems using
range-based on-vehicle sensors are invented, but they disregard the practical
difficulty of obtaining access to raw sensory data which are required for any
feature-based algorithm. In this paper, we focus on a system using short-range
radars (SRR) embedded in Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) to collect
occupancy information, and broadcast it through a connected vehicle network.
The challenge that the data transmitted through ADAS unit has been encoded to
sparse points is overcome by a statistical method instead of feature
extractions. We propose a two-step classification algorithm combining
Mean-Shift clustering and Support Vector Machine to analyze SRR-GPS data, and
evaluate it through field experiments. The results show that the average Type I
error rate for off-street parking is $15.23 \%$ and for on-street parking is
$32.62\%$. In both cased the Type II error rates are less than $20 \%$.
Bayesian updating can recursively improve the mapping results. This paper can
provide a comprehensive method to elevate automotive sensors for the parking
detection function.

 <dc:title>An initial study of the effect of pipelining in hiding HTTP/2.0 response

 <dc:creator>Morla, Ricardo</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  HTTP response size is a well-known side channel attack. With the deployment
of HTTP/2.0, response size attacks are generally dismissed with the argument
that pipelining and response multiplexing prevent eavesdroppers from finding
out response sizes. Yet the extent to which pipelining and response
multiplexing actually hide HTTP response sizes has not been adequately
investigated. In this paper we set out to help understand the effect of
pipelining in hiding the size of web objects on the Internet. We conduct an
experiment that provides browser-side HTTP response sizes and network-captured
TLS record sizes and show how the model that we propose for estimating response
sizes from TLS record sizes improves response matching and attack performance.
In this process we gather evidence on how different implementations of HTTP/2.0
web servers generate different side- channel information and the limited amount
of pipelining and response multiplexing used on the Internet today.

important mathematical tool, unifying and generalizing numerous inequalities in
analysis, convex geometry and information theory. While their structural theory
is very well understood, far less is known about computing their main
parameters.
  We give polynomial time algorithms to compute feasibility of BL-datum, the
optimal BL-constant and a weak separation oracle for the BL-polytope. The same
result holds for the so-called Reverse BL inequalities of Barthe. The best
known algorithms for any of these tasks required at least exponential time.
  The algorithms are obtained by a simple efficient reduction of a given
BL-datum to an instance of the Operator Scaling problem defined by Gurvits, for
which the present authors have provided a polynomial time algorithm. This
reduction implies algorithmic versions of many of the known structural results,
and in some cases provide proofs that are different or simpler than existing
ones.
  Of particular interest is the fact that the operator scaling algorithm is
continuous in its input. Thus as a simple corollary of our reduction we obtain
explicit bounds on the magnitude and continuity of the BL-constant in terms of
the BL-data. To the best of our knowledge no such bounds were known, as past
arguments relied on compactness. The continuity of BL-constants is important
for developing non-linear BL inequalities that have recently found so many
applications.

 <dc:description>  Advancements in information and communication technologies have enhanced our
possibilities to communicate worldwide, eliminating borders and making it
possible to interact with people coming from other cultures like never happened
before. Such powerful tools have brought us to reconsider our concept of
privacy and social involvement in order to make them fit into this wider
environment. It is possible to claim that the ICT revolution is changing our
world and is having a core role as a mediating factor for social movements
(e.g., Arab spring) and political decisions (e.g., Brexit), shaping the world
in a faster and shared brand new way. It is then interesting to explore how the
perception of this brand new environment (in terms of social engagement,
privacy perception and sense of belonging to a community) differs even in
similar cultures separated by recent historical reasons, as for example in
Italian and Turkish cultures.

 <dc:description>  The existence of gender differences in the structure and composition of
social networks is a well established finding in the social and behavioral
sciences, but researchers continue to debate whether structural, dispositional,
or life course factors are the primary driver of these differences. In this
paper we extend work on gender differences in social networks to patterns of
interaction, propinquity, and connectivity captured via a social sensing
platform comprised of an ensemble of individuals' phone calls, text messaging,
face-to-face interactions, and traces of their mobility activities. We attempt
to isolate dispositional from other factors by focusing on a relatively
homogeneous population on a relatively closed setting at the same stage in the
life course. Analysis across three different networks along with mobility data
reveals systematic gender differences in terms of communicative,
distributional, mobility, and spatial proximity tendencies. Most importantly,
some patterns observed in the communication network (e.g. stronger same-gender
preference for women) are found to be reversed in the spatial proximity
context, with men displaying a greater tendency to spend time in a narrower
(and thus more predictable) range of spaces with same-gender peers than women.
These findings provide robust and novel evidence for the powerful effect of
gender in structuring behavior across a wide range of communication and
mobility behaviors, validating and extending recent work pointing to
differences of socio-cultural and evolutionary origin in the styles of
sociability and interaction characteristic of men and women.

 <dc:title>Edge Coloring with Minimum Reload/Changeover Costs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In an edge-colored graph, a traversal cost occurs at a vertex along a path
when consecutive edges with different colors are traversed. The value of the
traversal cost depends only on the colors of the traversed edges. This concept
leads to two global cost measures, namely the \emph{reload cost} and the
\emph{changeover cost}, that have been studied in the literature and have
various applications in telecommunications, transportation networks, and energy
distribution networks. Previous work focused on problems with an edge-colored
graph being part of the input. In this paper, we formulate and focus on two
pairs of problems that aim to find an edge coloring of a graph so as to
minimize the reload and changeover costs. The first pair of problems aims to
find a proper edge coloring so that the reload/changeover cost of a set of
paths is minimized. The second pair of problems aim to find a proper edge
coloring and a spanning tree so that the reload/changeover cost is minimized.
We present several hardness results as well as polynomial-time solvable special
cases.

 <dc:description>  A graph is $(H_1,H_2)$-free for a pair of graphs $H_1,H_2$ if it contains no
induced subgraph isomorphic to $H_1$ or $H_2$. In 2001, Kr\'al',
Kratochv\'{\i}l, Tuza, and Woeginger initiated a study into the complexity of
Colouring for $(H_1,H_2)$-free graphs. Since then, others have tried to
complete their study, but many cases remain open. We focus on those
$(H_1,H_2)$-free graphs where $H_2$ is $\overline{H_1}$, the complement of
$H_1$. As these classes are closed under complementation, the computational
complexities of Colouring and Clique Cover coincide. By combining new and known
results, we are able to classify the complexity of Colouring and Clique Cover
for $(H,\overline{H})$-free graphs for all cases except when $H=sP_1+ P_3$ for
$s\geq 3$ or $H=sP_1+P_4$ for $s\geq 2$. We also classify the complexity of
Colouring on graph classes characterized by forbidding a finite number of
self-complementary induced subgraphs, and we initiate a study of $k$-Colouring
for $(P_r,\overline{P_r})$-free graphs.

 <dc:title>Predicting Enemy's Actions Improves Commander Decision-Making</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ownby, Michael</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Real-time Adversarial
Intelligence and Decision-making (RAID) program is investigating the
feasibility of &quot;reading the mind of the enemy&quot; - to estimate and anticipate, in
real-time, the enemy's likely goals, deceptions, actions, movements and
positions. This program focuses specifically on urban battles at echelons of
battalion and below. The RAID program leverages approximate game-theoretic and
deception-sensitive algorithms to provide real-time enemy estimates to a
tactical commander. A key hypothesis of the program is that these predictions
and recommendations will make the commander more effective, i.e. he should be
able to achieve his operational goals safer, faster, and more efficiently.
Realistic experimentation and evaluation drive the development process using
human-in-the-loop wargames to compare humans and the RAID system. Two
experiments were conducted in 2005 as part of Phase I to determine if the RAID
software could make predictions and recommendations as effectively and
accurately as a 4-person experienced staff. This report discusses the
intriguing and encouraging results of these first two experiments conducted by
the RAID program. It also provides details about the experiment environment and
methodology that were used to demonstrate and prove the research goals.

 <dc:description>  Network creation games have been extensively studied, both from economists
and computer scientists, due to their versatility in modeling individual-based
community formation processes, which in turn are the theoretical counterpart of
several economics, social, and computational applications on the Internet. In
their several variants, these games model the tension of a player between her
two antagonistic goals: to be as close as possible to the other players, and to
activate a cheapest possible set of links. However, the generally adopted
assumption is that players have a \emph{common and complete} information about
the ongoing network, which is quite unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we
consider a more compelling scenario in which players have only limited
information about the network they are embedded in. More precisely, we explore
the game-theoretic and computational implications of assuming that players have
a complete knowledge of the network structure only up to a given radius $k$,
which is one of the most qualified \emph{local-knowledge models} used in
distributed computing. To this respect, we define a suitable equilibrium
concept, and we provide a comprehensive set of upper and lower bounds to the
price of anarchy for the entire range of values of $k$, and for the two classic
variants of the game, namely those in which a player's cost --- besides the
activation cost of the owned links --- depends on the maximum/sum of all the
distances to the other nodes in the network, respectively. These bounds are
finally assessed through an extensive set of experiments.

finite time. Then, we devise a decentralized compensator to asymptotically pin
the network of mismatched systems to a desired trajectory. Next, we design

analytical results are verified by several simulations in a network of globally

 <dc:description>  In this paper we formally analyse the use of sparse filtering algorithms to
perform covariate shift adaptation. We provide a theoretical analysis of sparse
filtering by evaluating the conditions required to perform covariate shift
adaptation. We prove that sparse filtering can perform adaptation only if the
conditional distribution of the labels has a structure explained by a cosine
metric. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new algorithm, named periodic
sparse filtering, and carry out the same theoretical analysis regarding
covariate shift adaptation. We show that periodic sparse filtering can perform
adaptation under the looser and more realistic requirement that the conditional
distribution of the labels has a periodic structure, which may be satisfied,
for instance, by user-dependent data sets. We experimentally validate our
theoretical results on synthetic data. Moreover, we apply periodic sparse
filtering to real-world data sets to demonstrate that this simple and
computationally efficient algorithm is able to achieve competitive
performances.

 <dc:description>  A background model describes a scene without any foreground objects and has a
number of applications, ranging from video surveillance to computational
photography. Recent studies have introduced the method of Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (DMD) for robustly separating video frames into a background
model and foreground components. While the method introduced operates by
converting color images to grayscale, we in this study propose a technique to
obtain the background model in the color domain. The effectiveness of our
technique is demonstrated using a publicly available Scene Background
Initialisation (SBI) dataset. Our results both qualitatively and quantitatively
show that DMD can successfully obtain a colored background model.

data with the semantic map output of a classifier; second, we combine this
output with population deformable registration to improve both alignment and
segmentation. Our approach deforms all volumes towards consensus, taking into
account image similarities and label consistency. Our pipeline can incorporate
any classifier and similarity metric. Results on two datasets, containing
annotations of challenging brain structures, demonstrate the potential of our
method.

 <dc:description>  The rate-distortion dimension (RDD) of an analog stationary process is
studied as a measure of complexity that captures the amount of information
contained in the process. It is shown that the RDD of a process, defined as two
times the asymptotic ratio of its rate-distortion function $R(D)$ to $\log
{1\over D}$ as the distortion $D$ approaches zero, is equal to its information
dimension (ID). This generalizes an earlier result by Kawabata and Dembo and
provides an operational approach to evaluate the ID of a process, which
previously was shown to be closely related to the effective dimension of the
underlying process and also to the fundamental limits of compressed sensing.
The relation between RDD and ID is illustrated for a piecewise constant
process.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the effect of a single link on the capacity of a
network of error-free bit pipes. More precisely, we study the change in network
capacity that results when we remove a single link of capacity $\delta$. In a
recent result, we proved that if all the sources are directly available to a
single super-source node, then removing a link of capacity $\delta$ cannot
change the capacity region of the network by more than $\delta$ in each
dimension. In this paper, we extend this result to the case of multi-source,
multi-sink networks for some special network topologies.

 <dc:title>An ensemble learning method for scene classification based on Hidden
  Markov Model image representation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Low level images representation in feature space performs poorly for
classification with high accuracy since this level of representation is not
able to project images into the discriminative feature space. In this work, we
propose an efficient image representation model for classification. First we
apply Hidden Markov Model (HMM) on ordered grids represented by different type
of image descriptors in order to include causality of local properties existing
in image for feature extraction and then we train up a separate classifier for
each of these features sets. Finally we ensemble these classifiers efficiently
in a way that they can cancel out each other errors for obtaining higher
accuracy. This method is evaluated on 15 natural scene dataset. Experimental
results show the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to some
current existing methods

 <dc:description>  Social media have great potential to support diverse information sharing, but
there is widespread concern that platforms like Twitter do not result in
communication between those who hold contradictory viewpoints. Because users
can choose whom to follow, prior research suggests that social media users
exist in 'echo chambers' or become polarized. We seek evidence of this in a
complete cross section of hyperlinks posted on Twitter, using previously
validated measures of the political slant of news sources to study information
diversity. Contrary to prediction, we find that the average account posts links
to more politically moderate news sources than the ones they receive in their
own feed. However, members of a tiny network core do exhibit cross-sectional
evidence of polarization and are responsible for the majority of tweets
received overall due to their popularity and activity, which could explain the
widespread perception of polarization on social media.

 <dc:title>A probabilistic patch based image representation using Conditional
  Random Field model for image classification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Taherkhani, Fariborz</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we proposed an ordered patch based method using Conditional
Random Field (CRF) in order to encode local properties and their spatial
relationship in images to address texture classification, face recognition, and
scene classification problems. Typical image classification approaches work
without considering spatial causality among distinctive properties of an image
for image representation in feature space. In this method first, each image is
encoded as a sequence of ordered patches, including local properties. Second,
the sequence of these ordered patches is modeled as a probabilistic feature
vector by CRF to model spatial relationship of these local properties. And
finally, image classification is performed on such probabilistic image
representation. Experimental results on several standard image datasets
indicate that proposed method outperforms some of existing image classification
methods.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Preserving details in restoring images highly corrupted by impulse noise
remains a challenging problem. We proposed an algorithm based on radial basis
functions (RBF) interpolation which estimates the intensities of corrupted
pixels by their neighbors. In this algorithm, first intensity values of noisy
pixels in the corrupted image are estimated using RBFs. Next, the image is
smoothed. The proposed algorithm can effectively remove the highly dense
impulse noise. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed
algorithm in comparison to the recent similar methods both in noise suppression
and detail preservation. Extensive simulations show better results in measure
of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM),
especially when the image is corrupted by very highly dense impulse noise.

 <dc:title>Accounting for the Role of Long Walks on Networks via a New Matrix

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new matrix function for studying graphs and real-world
networks based on a double-factorial penalization of walks between nodes in a
graph. This new matrix function is based on the matrix error function. We find
a very good approximation of this function using a matrix hyperbolic tangent
function. We derive a communicability function, a subgraph centrality and a
double-factorial Estrada index based on this new matrix function. We obtain
upper and lower bounds for the double-factorial Estrada index of graphs,
showing that they are similar to those of the single-factorial Estrada index.
We then compare these indices with the single-factorial one for simple graphs
and real-world networks. We conclude that for networks containing chordless
cycles---holes---the two penalization schemes produce significantly different
results. In particular, we study two series of real-world networks representing
urban street networks, and protein residue networks. We observe that the
subgraph centrality based on both indices produce significantly different
ranking of the nodes. The use of the double factorial penalization of walks
opens new possibilities for studying important structural properties of
real-world networks where long-walks play a fundamental role, such as the cases
of networks containing chordless cycles.

 <dc:description>  Social media play an increasingly important role in political communication.
Various studies investigated how individuals adopt social media for political
discussion, to share their views about politics and policy, or to mobilize and
protest against social issues. Yet, little attention has been devoted to the
main actors of political discussions: the politicians. In this paper, we
explore the topics of discussion of U.S. President Obama and the 50 U.S. State
Governors using Twitter data and agenda-setting theory as a tool to describe
the patterns of daily political discussion, uncovering the main topics of
attention and interest of these actors. We examine over one hundred thousand
tweets produced by these politicians and identify seven macro-topics of
conversation, finding that Twitter represents a particularly appealing vehicle
of conversation for American opposition politicians. We highlight the main
motifs of political conversation of the two parties, discovering that
Republican and Democrat Governors are more or less similarly active on Twitter
but exhibit different styles of communication. Finally, by reconstructing the
networks of occurrences of Governors' hashtags and keywords related to
political issues, we observe that Republicans form a tight core, with a
stronger shared agenda on many issues of discussion.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel inverse Dynamic Reachability Map (iDRM)
that allows a floating base system to find valid end-poses in complex and
dynamically changing environments in real-time. End-pose planning for valid
stance pose and collision-free configuration is an essential problem for
humanoid applications, such as providing goal states for walking and motion
planners. However, this is non-trivial in complex environments, where standing
locations and reaching postures are restricted by obstacles. Our proposed iDRM
customizes the robot-to-workspace occupation list and uses an online update
algorithm to enable efficient reconstruction of the reachability map to
guarantee that the selected end-poses are always collision-free. The iDRM was
evaluated in a variety of reaching tasks using the 38 degree-of-freedom (DoF)
humanoid robot Valkyrie. Our results show that the approach is capable of
finding valid end-poses in a fraction of a second. Significantly, we also
demonstrate that motion planning algorithms integrating our end-pose planning
method are more efficient than those not utilizing this technique.

 <dc:description>  Automating the solutions of multiple network information theory problems,
stretching from fundamental concerns such as determining all information
inequalities and the limitations of linear codes, to applied ones such as
designing coded networks, distributed storage systems, and caching systems, can
be posed as polyhedral projections. These problems are demonstrated to exhibit
multiple types of polyhedral symmetries. It is shown how these symmetries can
be exploited to reduce the complexity of solving these problems through
polyhedral projection.

 <dc:description>  This paper is concerned with the development and testing of advanced
time-stepping methods suited for the integration of time-accurate, real-world
applications of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The performance of several
time discretization methods is studied numerically with regards to
computational efficiency, order of accuracy, and stability, as well as the
ability to treat effectively stiff problems. We consider matrix-free
implementations, a popular approach for time-stepping methods applied to large
CFD applications due to its adherence to scalable matrix-vector operations and
a small memory footprint. We compare explicit methods with matrix-free
implementations of implicit, linearly-implicit, as well as Rosenbrock-Krylov
methods. We show that Rosenbrock-Krylov methods are competitive with existing
techniques excelling for a number of problem types and settings.

 <dc:description>  We present nonasymptotic achievability and converse bounds on the maximum
coding rate (for a fixed average error probability and a fixed average
blocklength) of variable-length full-feedback (VLF) and variable-length
stop-feedback (VLSF) codes operating over a binary erasure channel (BEC). For
the VLF setup, the achievability bound relies on a scheme that maps each
message onto a variable-length Huffman codeword and then repeats each bit of
the codeword until it is received correctly. The converse bound is inspired by
the meta-converse framework by Polyanskiy, Poor, and Verd\'u (2010) and relies
on binary sequential hypothesis testing. For the case of zero error
probability, our achievability and converse bounds match. For the VLSF case, we
provide achievability bounds that exploit the following feature of BEC: the
decoder can assess the correctness of its estimate by verifying whether the
chosen codeword is the only one that is compatible with the erasure pattern.
One of these bounds is obtained by analyzing the performance of a
variable-length extension of random linear fountain codes. The gap between the
VLSF achievability and the VLF converse bound, when number of messages is
small, is significant: $23\%$ for 8 messages on a BEC with erasure probability
$0.5.$ The absence of a tight VLSF converse bound does not allow us to assess
whether this gap is fundamental.

 <dc:description>  Crowdfunding platforms have become important sites where people can create
projects to seek funds toward turning their ideas into products, and back
someone else's projects. As news media have reported successfully funded
projects (e.g., Pebble Time, Coolest Cooler), more people have joined
crowdfunding platforms and launched projects. But in spite of rapid growth of
the number of users and projects, a project success rate at large has been
decreasing because of launching projects without enough preparation and
experience. Little is known about what reactions project creators made (e.g.,
giving up or making the failed projects better) when projects failed, and what
types of successful projects we can find. To solve these problems, in this
manuscript we (i) collect the largest datasets from Kickstarter, consisting of
all project profiles, corresponding user profiles, projects' temporal data and
users' social media information; (ii) analyze characteristics of successful
projects, behaviors of users and understand dynamics of the crowdfunding
platform; (iii) propose novel statistical approaches to predict whether a
project will be successful and a range of expected pledged money of the
project; (iv) develop predictive models and evaluate performance of the models;
(v) analyze what reactions project creators had when project failed, and if
they did not give up, how they made the failed projects successful; and (vi)
cluster successful projects by their evolutional patterns of pledged money
toward understanding what efforts project creators should make in order to get
more pledged money. Our experimental results show that the predictive models
can effectively predict project success and a range of expected pledged money.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of decentralized Bayesian learning in a dynamical system
involving strategic agents with asymmetric information. In a series of seminal
papers in the literature, this problem has been studied under a simplifying
model where selfish players appear sequentially and act once in the game, based
on private noisy observations of the system state and public observation of
past players' actions. It is shown that there exist information cascades where
users discard their private information and mimic the action of their
predecessor. In this paper, we provide a framework for studying Bayesian
learning dynamics in a more general setting than the one described above. In
particular, our model incorporates cases where players participate for the
whole duration of the game, and cases where an endogenous process selects which
subset of players will act at each time instance. The proposed methodology
hinges on a sequential decomposition for finding perfect Bayesian equilibria
(PBE) of a general class of dynamic games with asymmetric information, where
user-specific states evolve as conditionally independent Markov process and
users make independent noisy observations of their states. Using our
methodology, we study a specific dynamic learning model where players make
decisions about investing in the team, based on their estimates of everyone's
types. We characterize a set of informational cascades for this problem where
learning stops for the team as a whole.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel approach to natural language understanding
that utilizes context-free grammars (CFGs) in conjunction with
sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) deep learning. Specifically, we take a CFG
authored to generate dialogue for our target application for NLU, a videogame,
and train a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) to map
the surface utterances that it produces to traces of the grammatical expansions
that yielded them. Critically, this CFG was authored using a tool we have
developed that supports arbitrary annotation of the nonterminal symbols in the
grammar. Because we already annotated the symbols in this grammar for the
semantic and pragmatic considerations that our game's dialogue manager operates
over, we can use the grammatical trace associated with any surface utterance to
infer such information. During gameplay, we translate player utterances into
grammatical traces (using our RNN), collect the mark-up attributed to the
symbols included in that trace, and pass this information to the dialogue
manager, which updates the conversation state accordingly. From an offline
evaluation task, we demonstrate that our trained RNN translates surface
utterances to grammatical traces with great accuracy. To our knowledge, this is
the first usage of seq2seq learning for conversational agents (our game's
characters) who explicitly reason over semantic and pragmatic considerations.

 <dc:description>  Understanding visual reality involves acquiring common-sense knowledge about
countless regularities in the visual world, e.g., how illumination alters the
appearance of objects in a scene, and how motion changes their apparent spatial
relationship. These regularities are hard to label for training supervised
machine learning algorithms; consequently, algorithms need to learn these
regularities from the real world in an unsupervised way. We present a novel
network meta-architecture that can learn world dynamics from raw, continuous
video. The components of this network can be implemented using any algorithm
that possesses three key capabilities: prediction of a signal over time,
reduction of signal dimensionality (compression), and the ability to use
supplementary contextual information to inform the prediction. The presented
architecture is highly-parallelized and scalable, and is implemented using
localized connectivity, processing, and learning. We demonstrate an
implementation of this architecture where the components are built from
multi-layer perceptrons. We apply the implementation to create a system capable
of stable and robust visual tracking of objects as seen by a moving camera.
Results show performance on par with or exceeding state-of-the-art tracking
algorithms. The tracker can be trained in either fully supervised or
unsupervised-then-briefly-supervised regimes. Success of the briefly-supervised
regime suggests that the unsupervised portion of the model extracts useful
information about visual reality. The results suggest a new class of AI
algorithms that uniquely combine prediction and scalability in a way that makes
them suitable for learning from and --- and eventually acting within --- the
real world.

 <dc:description>  Software model checking constitutes an undecidable problem and, as such, even
an ideal tool will in some cases fail to give a conclusive answer. In practice,
software model checkers fail often and usually do not provide any information
on what was effectively checked. The purpose of this work is to provide a
conceptual framing to extend software model checkers in a way that allows users
to access information about incomplete checks. We characterize the information
that model checkers themselves can provide, in terms of analyzed traces, i.e.
sequences of statements, and safe cones, and present the notion of execution
reports, which we also formalize. We instantiate these concepts for a family of
techniques based on Abstract Reachability Trees and implement the approach
using the software model checker CPAchecker. We evaluate our approach
empirically and provide examples to illustrate the execution reports produced
and the information that can be extracted.

 <dc:title>Connectivity Oracles for Graphs Subject to Vertex Failures</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We introduce new data structures for answering connectivity queries in graphs
subject to batched vertex failures. A deterministic structure processes a batch
of $d\leq d_{\star}$ failed vertices in $\tilde{O}(d^3)$ time and thereafter
answers connectivity queries in $O(d)$ time. It occupies space $O(d_{\star}
m\log n)$. We develop a randomized Monte Carlo version of our data structure
with update time $\tilde{O}(d^2)$, query time $O(d)$, and space $\tilde{O}(m)$
for any failure bound $d\le n$. This is the first connectivity oracle for
general graphs that can efficiently deal with an unbounded number of vertex
failures.
  We also develop a more efficient Monte Carlo edge-failure connectivity
oracle. Using space $O(n\log^2 n)$, $d$ edge failures are processed in $O(d\log
d\log\log n)$ time and thereafter, connectivity queries are answered in
$O(\log\log n)$ time, which are correct w.h.p.
  Our data structures are based on a new decomposition theorem for an
undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, which is of independent interest. It states that
for any terminal set $U\subseteq V$ we can remove a set $B$ of $|U|/(s-2)$
vertices such that the remaining graph contains a Steiner forest for $U-B$ with
maximum degree $s$.

 <dc:description>  The &quot;interpretation through synthesis&quot; approach to analyze face images,
particularly Active Appearance Models (AAMs) method, has become one of the most
successful face modeling approaches over the last two decades. AAM models have
ability to represent face images through synthesis using a controllable
parameterized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model. However, the accuracy
and robustness of the synthesized faces of AAM are highly depended on the
training sets and inherently on the generalizability of PCA subspaces. This
paper presents a novel Deep Appearance Models (DAMs) approach, an efficient
replacement for AAMs, to accurately capture both shape and texture of face
images under large variations. In this approach, three crucial components
represented in hierarchical layers are modeled using the Deep Boltzmann
Machines (DBM) to robustly capture the variations of facial shapes and
appearances. DAMs are therefore superior to AAMs in inferencing a
representation for new face images under various challenging conditions. The
proposed approach is evaluated in various applications to demonstrate its
robustness and capabilities, i.e. facial super-resolution reconstruction,
facial off-angle reconstruction or face frontalization, facial occlusion
removal and age estimation using challenging face databases, i.e. Labeled Face
Parts in the Wild (LFPW), Helen and FG-NET. Comparing to AAMs and other deep
learning based approaches, the proposed DAMs achieve competitive results in
those applications, thus this showed their advantages in handling occlusions,
facial representation, and reconstruction.

 <dc:description>  Actions may not proceed as planned; they may be interrupted, resumed or
overridden. This is a challenge to handle in a natural language understanding
system. We describe extensions to an existing implementation for the control of
autonomous systems by natural language, to enable such systems to handle
incoming language requests regarding actions. Language Communication with
Autonomous Systems (LCAS) has been extended with support for X-nets,
parameterized executable schemas representing actions. X-nets enable the system
to control actions at a desired level of granularity, while providing a
mechanism for language requests to be processed asynchronously. Standard
semantics supported include requests to stop, continue, or override the
existing action. The specific domain demonstrated is the control of motion of a
simulated robot, but the approach is general, and could be applied to other
domains.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this research is to evaluate the human and technical factors
required to create a human-computer interface (HCI) for a structured reporting
solution based on eye-gaze and speech signals. Gaze and speech signals from
radiologists acquired during simulated image interpretation and dictation
sessions were analyzed to determine a) variation of temporal relationship
between eye gaze and speech in a dictation environment, and b) variation in eye
movements for a particular image interpretation task among radiologists.
Knowledge of these factors provides information regarding the complexity of the
image interpretation or dictation task, and provides information that can be
used to design a HCI for use in diagnostic radiology. Our ultimate goal is to
use these data to create an HCI to automate the generation of a particular type
of structured radiology report. Our data indicate that the a) temporal
relationships between eye gaze and speech and b) scan paths substantially vary
among radiologists, thus implying that an HCI system based on eye gaze and
speech for automating the capture of data for structured reporting processes
should be customized for each user. The image resolution and layout, image
content, and order of targets during an image interpretation session are not
relevant factors to consider when designing an HCI. Our findings can be applied
to the design of other HCI solutions for radiological applications that involve
visual inspection and verbal descriptions of image findings.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a coding strategy designed to enhance the throughput
of hybrid ARQ (HARQ) transmissions over i.i.d. block-fading channels with the
channel state information (CSI) unknown at the transmitter. We use a joint
packet coding where the same channel block is logically shared among many
packets. To reduce the complexity, we use a two-layer coding where, first,
packets are first coded by the binary compressing encoders, and the results are
then passed to the conventional channel encoder. We show how to optimize the
compression rates on the basis of the empirical error-rate curves. We also
discuss how the parameters of the practical turbo-codes may be modified to take
advantage of the proposed HARQ scheme. Finally, simple and pragmatic rate
adaptation strategies are developed. In numerical examples, our scheme is
compared to the conventional incremental redundancy HARQ (IR-HARQ), and it
yields a notable gain of 1-2 dB in the region of high throughput, where HARQ
fails to provide any improvement.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a randomized Las Vegas distributed algorithm that
constructs a minimum spanning tree (MST) in weighted networks with optimal (up
to polylogarithmic factors) time and message complexity. This algorithm runs in
$\tilde{O}(D + \sqrt{n})$ time and exchanges $\tilde{O}(m)$ messages (both with
high probability), where $n$ is the number of nodes of the network, $D$ is the
diameter, and $m$ is the number of edges. This is the first distributed MST
algorithm that matches \emph{simultaneously} the time lower bound of
$\tilde{\Omega}(D + \sqrt{n})$ [Elkin, SIAM J. Comput. 2006] and the message
lower bound of $\Omega(m)$ [Kutten et al., J.ACM 2015] (which both apply to
randomized algorithms).
  The prior time and message lower bounds are derived using two completely
different graph constructions; the existing lower bound construction that shows
one lower bound {\em does not} work for the other. To complement our algorithm,
we present a new lower bound graph construction for which any distributed MST
algorithm requires \emph{both} $\tilde{\Omega}(D + \sqrt{n})$ rounds and
$\Omega(m)$ messages.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things (IoT), in general, is a compelling paradigm that aims
to connect everyday objects to the Internet. Nowadays, IoT is considered as one
of the main technologies which contribute towards reshaping our daily lives in
the next decade. IoT unlocks many exciting new opportunities in a variety of
applications in research and industry domains. However, many have complained
about the absence of the real-world IoT data. Unsurprisingly, a common question
that arises regularly nowadays is &quot;Does the IoT already exist?&quot;. So far, little
has been known about the real-world situation on IoT, its attributes, the
presentation of data and user interests. To answer this question, in this work,
we conduct an in-depth analytical investigation on real IoT data. More
specifically, we identify IoT data sources over the Web and develop a crawler
engine to collect large-scale real-world IoT data for the first time. We make
the results of our work available to the public in order to assist the
community in the future research. In particular, we collect the data of nearly
two million Internet connected objects and study trends in IoT using a
real-world query set from an IoT search engine. Based on the collected data and
our analysis, we identify the typical characteristics of IoT data. The most
intriguing finding of our study is that IoT data is mainly disseminated using
Web Mapping while the emerging IoT solutions such as the Web of Things, are
currently not well adopted. On top of our findings, we further discuss future
challenges and open research problems in the IoT area.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present the PUMP (Parallel Uncertainty-aware Multiobjective
Planning) algorithm for addressing the stochastic kinodynamic motion planning
problem, whereby one seeks a low-cost, dynamically-feasible motion plan subject
to a constraint on collision probability (CP). To ensure exhaustive evaluation
of candidate motion plans (as needed to tradeoff the competing objectives of
performance and safety), PUMP incrementally builds the Pareto front of the
problem, accounting for the optimization objective and an approximation of CP.
This is performed by a massively parallel multiobjective search, here
implemented with a focus on GPUs. Upon termination of the exploration phase,
PUMP searches the Pareto set of motion plans to identify the lowest cost
solution that is certified to satisfy the CP constraint (according to an
asymptotically exact estimator). We introduce a novel particle-based CP
approximation scheme, designed for efficient GPU implementation, which accounts
for dependencies over the history of a trajectory execution. We present
numerical experiments for quadrotor planning wherein PUMP identifies solutions
in ~100 ms, evaluating over one hundred thousand partial plans through the
course of its exploration phase. The results show that this multiobjective
search achieves a lower motion plan cost, for the same CP constraint, compared
to a safety buffer-based search heuristic and repeated RRT trials.

 <dc:title>Analysis of SINR Outage in Large-Scale Cellular Networks Using
  Campbell's Theorem and Cumulant Generating Functions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) outage probability is one
of the key performance parameters of a wireless cellular network, and its
analytical as well as numerical evaluation has occupied many researchers.
Recently, the introduction of stochastic geometric modeling of cellular
networks has brought the outage problem to the forefront again. A popular and
powerful approach is to exploit the available moment generating function (or
Laplace transform) of received signal and interference, whenever it exists, by
applying the Gil-Pelaez inversion formula. However, with the stochastic
geometric modeling, the moment generating function may either be too
complicated to exist in closed-form or at worst may not exist. Toward this end,
in this paper, we study two alternate ways of evaluating the SINR outage. In
the first case, we emphasize the significance of calculating cumulants over
moments and exploit the fact that the cumulants of point processes are easily
calculable using Campbell's theorem. The SINR outage is then analytically
characterized by Charlier expansion based on Gaussian and Student's
$t$-distributions and their associated Hermite and Krishnamoorthy polynomials.
In the second case, we exploit the saddle point method, which gives a
semi-analytical method of calculating the SINR outage, whenever the cumulant
generating function of received signal and interference exists. For the purpose
of demonstration, we apply these techniques on a downlink cellular network
model where a typical user experiences a coordinated multi-point transmission,
and the base stations are modeled by homogeneous Poisson point process. For the
convenience of readers, we also provide a brief overview of moments, cumulants,
their generating functions, and Campbell's theorem, without invoking measure
theory. Numerical results illustrate the accuracy of the proposed mathematical
approaches.

 <dc:description>  Voltage control in power distribution networks has been greatly challenged by
the increasing penetration of volatile and intermittent devices. These devices
can also provide limited reactive power resources that can be used to regulate
the network-wide voltage. A decentralized voltage control strategy can be
designed by minimizing a quadratic voltage mismatch error objective using
gradient-projection (GP) updates. Coupled with the power network flow, the
local voltage can provide the instantaneous gradient information. This paper
aims to analyze the performance of this decentralized GP-based voltage control
design under two dynamic scenarios: i) the nodes perform the decentralized
update in an asynchronous fashion, and ii) the network operating condition is
time-varying. For the asynchronous voltage control, we improve the existing
convergence condition by recognizing that the voltage based gradient is always
up-to-date. By modeling the network dynamics using an autoregressive process
and considering time-varying resource constraints, we provide an error bound in
tracking the instantaneous optimal solution to the quadratic error objective.
This result can be extended to more general \textit{constrained dynamic
optimization} problems with smooth strongly convex objective functions under
stochastic processes that have bounded iterative changes. Extensive numerical
tests have been performed to demonstrate and validate our analytical results
for realistic power networks.

 <dc:description>  In technical support scams, cybercriminals attempt to convince users that
their machines are infected with malware and are in need of their technical
support. In this process, the victims are asked to provide scammers with remote
access to their machines, who will then &quot;diagnose the problem&quot;, before offering
their support services which typically cost hundreds of dollars. Despite their
conceptual simplicity, technical support scams are responsible for yearly
losses of tens of millions of dollars from everyday users of the web. In this
paper, we report on the first systematic study of technical support scams and
the call centers hidden behind them. We identify malvertising as a major
culprit for exposing users to technical support scams and use it to build an
automated system capable of discovering, on a weekly basis, hundreds of phone
numbers and domains operated by scammers. By allowing our system to run for
more than 8 months we collect a large corpus of technical support scams and use
it to provide insights on their prevalence, the abused infrastructure, the
illicit profits, and the current evasion attempts of scammers. Finally, by
setting up a controlled, IRB-approved, experiment where we interact with 60
different scammers, we experience first-hand their social engineering tactics,
while collecting detailed statistics of the entire process. We explain how our
findings can be used by law-enforcing agencies and propose technical and
educational countermeasures for helping users avoid being victimized by
technical support scams.

 <dc:description>  Today, in the digital age, the mobile devices are more and more used to aid
people in the struggle to improve or maintain their health. In this paper, the
mobile eHealth solution for remote patient monitoring during clinical trials is
presented, together with the outcomes of quantitative and qualitative
performance evaluation. The evaluation is a third step to improve the quality
of the application after earlier Good Clinical Practice certification and
validation with the participation of 10 patients and three general
practitioners. This time, the focus was on the usability which was evaluated by
the seventeen participants divided into three age groups (18-28, 29-50, and
50+). The results, from recorded sessions and the eye tracking, show that there
is no difference in performance between the first group and the second group,
while for the third group the performance was worse, however, it was still good
enough to complete task within reasonable time.

 <dc:description>  Despite a variety of theoretical-sound techniques have been proposed for
biometric template protection, there is rarely practical solution that
guarantees non-invertibility, cancellability, non-linkability and performance
simultaneously. In this paper, a ranking-based representational transformation
is proposed for fingerprint templates. The proposed method transforms a
real-valued feature vector into index code such that the pairwise-order measure
in the resultant codes are closely correlated with rank similarity measure.
Such a ranking based technique offers two major merits: 1) Resilient to
noises/perturbations in numeric values; and 2) Highly nonlinear embedding based
on partial order statistics. The former takes care of the accuracy performance
mitigating numeric noises/perturbations while the latter offers strong
non-invertible transformation via nonlinear feature embedding from Euclidean to
Rank space that leads to toughness in inversion. The experimental results
demonstrate reasonable accuracy performance on benchmark FVC2002 and FVC2004
fingerprint databases, thus confirm the proposition of the rank correlation.
Moreover, the security and privacy analysis justify the strong capability
against the existing major privacy attacks.

 <dc:description>  Fluctuations in electricity tariffs induced by the sporadic nature of demand
loads on power grids has initiated immense efforts to find optimal scheduling
solutions for charging and discharging plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) subject
to different objective sets. In this paper, we consider vehicle-to-grid (V2G)
scheduling at a geographically large scale in which PEVs have the flexibility
of charging/discharging at multiple smart stations coordinated by individual
aggregators. We first formulate the objective of maximizing the overall profit
of both, demand and supply entities, by defining a weighting parameter. We then
propose an online decentralized greedy algorithm for the formulated mixed
integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, which incorporates efficient
heuristics to practically guide each incoming vehicle to the most appropriate
charging station (CS). The better performance of the presented algorithm
compared to an alternative allocation strategy is demonstrated through
simulations in terms of the overall achievable profit and flatness of the final
electricity load. Moreover, the results of simulations reveal the existence of
optimal number of deployed stations at which the overall profit can be
maximized.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider a variation of a recoloring problem, called the
Color-Fixing. Let us have some non-proper $r$-coloring $\varphi$ of a graph
$G$. We investigate the problem of finding a proper $r$-coloring of $G$, which
is &quot;the most similar&quot; to $\varphi$, i.e. the number $k$ of vertices that have
to be recolored is minimum possible. We observe that the problem is NP-complete
for any $r \geq 3$, even for bipartite planar graphs. On the other hand, the
problem is fixed-parameter tractable, when parameterized by the number of
allowed transformations $k$. We provide an $2^n \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$
algorithm for the problem (for any fixed $r$) and a linear algorithm for graphs
with bounded treewidth. We also show several lower complexity bounds, using
standard complexity assumptions. Finally, we investigate the {\em fixing
number} of a graph $G$. It is the maximum possible distance (in the number of
transformations) between some non-proper coloring of $G$ and a proper one.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Homophonic coding is a framework to reversibly convert a message into a
sequence with some target distribution. This is a promising tool to generate a
codeword with a biased code-symbol distribution, which is required for
capacity-achieving communication by asymmetric channels. It is known that
asymptotically optimal homophonic coding can be realized by a Fixed-to-Variable
(FV) length code using an interval algorithm similar to a random number
generator. However, FV codes are not preferable as a component of channel codes
since a decoding error propagates to all subsequent codewords. As a solution
for this problem an asymptotically optimal Variable-to-Fixed (VF) length
homophonic code, dual Shannon-Fano-Elias-Gray (dual SFEG) code, is proposed in
this paper. This code can be interpreted as a dual of a modified
Shannon-Fano-Elias (SFE) code based on Gray code. It is also shown as a
by-product that the modified SFE code, named SFEG code, achieves a better
coding rate than the original SFE code in lossless source coding.

 <dc:description>  We present a static deadlock analysis approach for C/pthreads. The design of
our method has been guided by the requirement to analyse real-world code. Our
approach is sound (i.e., misses no deadlocks) for programs that have defined
behaviour according to the C standard, and precise enough to prove
deadlock-freedom for a large number of programs. The method consists of a
pipeline of several analyses that build on a new context- and thread-sensitive
abstract interpretation framework. We further present a lightweight dependency
analysis to identify statements relevant to deadlock analysis and thus speed up
the overall analysis. In our experimental evaluation, we succeeded to prove
deadlock-freedom for 262 programs from the Debian GNU/Linux distribution with
in total 2.6 MLOC in less than 11 hours.

 <dc:description>  Symbolic Computation and Satisfiability Checking are viewed as individual
research areas, but they share common interests in the development,
implementation and application of decision procedures for arithmetic theories.
Despite these commonalities, the two communities are currently only weakly
connected. We introduce a new project SC-square to build a joint community in
this area, supported by a newly accepted EU (H2020-FETOPEN-CSA) project of the
same name. We aim to strengthen the connection between these communities by
creating common platforms, initiating interaction and exchange, identifying
common challenges, and developing a common roadmap. This abstract and
accompanying poster describes the motivation and aims for the project, and
reports on the first activities.

 <dc:description>  Sentence ordering is a general and critical task for natural language
generation applications. Previous works have focused on improving its
performance in an external, downstream task, such as multi-document
summarization. Given its importance, we propose to study it as an isolated
task. We collect a large corpus of academic texts, and derive a data driven
approach to learn pairwise ordering of sentences, and validate the efficacy
with extensive experiments. Source codes and dataset of this paper will be made
publicly available.

 <dc:description>  Concepts and methods of complex networks can be used to analyse texts at
their different complexity levels. Examples of natural language processing
(NLP) tasks studied via topological analysis of networks are keyword
identification, automatic extractive summarization and authorship attribution.
Even though a myriad of network measurements have been applied to study the
authorship attribution problem, the use of motifs for text analysis has been
restricted to a few works. The goal of this paper is to apply the concept of
motifs, recurrent interconnection patterns, in the authorship attribution task.
The absolute frequencies of all thirteen directed motifs with three nodes were
extracted from the co-occurrence networks and used as classification features.
The effectiveness of these features was verified with four machine learning
methods. The results show that motifs are able to distinguish the writing style
of different authors. In our best scenario, 57.5% of the books were correctly
classified. The chance baseline for this problem is 12.5%. In addition, we have
found that function words play an important role in these recurrent patterns.
Taken together, our findings suggest that motifs should be further explored in
other related linguistic tasks.

 <dc:title>On the effects of a centralized computer routing and reservation system
  on the electric vehicle public charging network</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Conway, Thomas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One solution to the limited range of battery electric vehicles is the
provision of a public charging infrastructure to enable longer journeys. This
paper describes a simulation model of a centralized computer routing and
reservation system based on the current charging infrastructure deployed (early
2016) in Ireland using the Irish population density and a trip length
distribution. Monte Carlo simulations show quantitatively the effects of EV
on-board charger power rating and the advantages of a routing and reservation
systems on a country wide scale in terms of the number of electric vehicles
that can be supported. The effect of charge point fault rates based on the
currently deployed charging infrastructure is also assessed.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A resolution complete optimal kinodynamic motion planning algorithm is
presented and described as a generalized label correcting (GLC) method. In
contrast to related algorithms, the GLC method does not require a local
planning subroutine and benefits from a simple implementation. The key
contributions of this paper are the construction and analysis of the GLC
conditions which are the basis of the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the running time of the GLC method to be less than the related SST
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we tackle the problem of 24 hours-monitoring patient actions
in a ward such as &quot;stretching an arm out of the bed&quot;, &quot;falling out of the bed&quot;,
where temporal movements are subtle or significant. In the concerned scenarios,
the relations between scene layouts and body kinematics (skeletons) become
important cues to recognize actions; however they are hard to be secured at a
testing stage. To address this problem, we propose a kinematic-layout-aware
random forest which takes into account the kinematic-layout (\ie layout and
skeletons), to maximize the discriminative power of depth image appearance. We
integrate the kinematic-layout in the split criteria of random forests to guide
the learning process by 1) determining the switch to either the depth
appearance or the kinematic-layout information, and 2) implicitly closing the
gap between two distributions obtained by the kinematic-layout and the
appearance, when the kinematic-layout appears useful. The kinematic-layout
information is not required for the test data, thus called &quot;privileged
information prior&quot;. The proposed method has also been testified in cross-view
settings, by the use of view-invariant features and enforcing the consistency
among synthetic-view data. Experimental evaluations on our new dataset PATIENT,
CAD-60 and UWA3D (multiview) demonstrate that our method outperforms various
state-of-the-arts.

 <dc:title>Combined Classifiers for Invariant Face Recognition</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Eid, Ahmad H. A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  No single classifier can alone solve the complex problem of face recognition.
Researchers found that combining some base classifiers usually enhances their
recognition rate. The weaknesses of the base classifiers are reflected on the
resulting combined system. In this work, a system for combining unstable, low
performance classifiers is proposed. The system is applied to face images of
392 persons. The system shows remarkable stability and high recognition rate
using a reduced number of parameters. The system illustrates the possibility of
designing a combined system that benefits from the strengths of its base
classifiers while avoiding many of their weaknesses.

 <dc:description>  A classic problem in computational biology is constructing a phylogenetic
tree given a set of distances between n species. In most cases, a tree
structure is too constraining. We consider a circular split network, a
generalization of a tree in which multiple parallel edges signify divergence. A
geometric space of such networks is introduced, forming a natural extension of
the work by Billera, Holmes, and Vogtmann on tree space. We explore properties
of this space, and show a natural embedding of the compactification of the real
moduli space of curves within it.

 <dc:description>  From the dawn of civilization, people have used folktales and stories to
share information and knowledge. After the invention of printing in the 15th
century, technology provided helpful yet complicated utilities to exchange
ideas. In the present computerized world, the art of storytelling is becoming
more influential through the unprecedented multimedia capabilities of
computers. In this article, we introduce a state-of-the-art presentation
software by which academicians can present nonlinear topics efficiently and
sharpen their storytelling skills. We show how the proposed software can
improve the scientific presentation style. We conducted a survey to measure the
attractiveness of proposed utility among other alternatives. Results show that
academicians prefer the proposed platform to others.

 <dc:title>Ego2Top: Matching Viewers in Egocentric and Top-view Videos</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Egocentric cameras are becoming increasingly popular and provide us with
large amounts of videos, captured from the first person perspective. At the
same time, surveillance cameras and drones offer an abundance of visual
information, often captured from top-view. Although these two sources of
information have been separately studied in the past, they have not been
collectively studied and related. Having a set of egocentric cameras and a
top-view camera capturing the same area, we propose a framework to identify the
egocentric viewers in the top-view video. We utilize two types of features for
our assignment procedure. Unary features encode what a viewer (seen from
top-view or recording an egocentric video) visually experiences over time.
Pairwise features encode the relationship between the visual content of a pair
of viewers. Modeling each view (egocentric or top) by a graph, the assignment
process is formulated as spectral graph matching. Evaluating our method over a
dataset of 50 top-view and 188 egocentric videos taken in different scenarios
demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed approach in assigning egocentric
viewers to identities present in top-view camera. We also study the effect of
different parameters such as the number of egocentric viewers and visual
features.

 <dc:description>  Interactive learning is a process in which a machine learning algorithm is
provided with meaningful, well-chosen examples as opposed to randomly chosen
examples typical in standard supervised learning. In this paper, we propose a
new method for interactive learning from multiple noisy labels where we exploit
the disagreement among annotators to quantify the easiness (or meaningfulness)
of an example. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method in estimating the
parameters of a latent variable classification model, and conduct experimental
analyses on a range of synthetic and benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we
theoretically analyze the performance of perceptron in this interactive
learning framework.

 <dc:description>  Our Critical Infrastructure (CI) systems are, by definition, critical to the
safe and proper functioning of society. Nearly all of these systems utilize
industrial Process Control Systems (PCS) to provide clean water, reliable
electricity, critical manufacturing, and many other services within our
communities - yet most of these PCS incorporate very little cyber-security
countermeasures. Cyber-attacks on CI are becoming an attractive target. While
many vendor solutions are starting to be deployed at CI sites, these solutions
are largely based on network monitoring for intrusion detection. As such, they
are not process-aware, nor do they account for inter dependencies among other
CI sites in their community. What is proposed is an architecture for
coordinating all CI within a community, which defines characteristics to
enhance its integration, its resilience to failure and attack, and its ultimate
acceptance by CI operators.

 <dc:description>  Community detection is a central problem of network data analysis. Given a
network, the goal of community detection is to partition the network nodes into
a small number of clusters, which could often help reveal interesting
structures. The present paper studies community detection in Degree-Corrected
Block Models (DCBMs). We first derive asymptotic minimax risks of the problem
for a misclassification proportion loss under appropriate conditions. The
minimax risks are shown to depend on degree-correction parameters, community
sizes, and average within and between community connectivities in an intuitive
and interpretable way. In addition, we propose a polynomial time algorithm to
adaptively perform consistent and even asymptotically optimal community
detection in DCBMs.

real-world applications. However, for large-scale problems involving a huge
number of samples and extremely high-dimensional features, solving sparse SVMs
remains challenging. By noting that sparse SVMs induce sparsities in both
feature and sample spaces, we propose a novel approach, which is based on
accurate estimations of the primal and dual optima of sparse SVMs, to
simultaneously identify the features and samples that are guaranteed to be
irrelevant to the outputs. Thus, we can remove the identified inactive samples
and features from the training phase, leading to substantial savings in both
the memory usage and computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. To the
best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the \emph{first} \emph{static}
feature and sample reduction method for sparse SVM. Experiments on both
synthetic and real datasets (e.g., the kddb dataset with about 20 million
samples and 30 million features) demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and the speedup gained by our approach can
be orders of magnitude.

 <dc:description>  Objective functions for training of deep networks for face-related
recognition tasks, such as facial expression recognition (FER), usually
consider each sample independently. In this work, we present a novel
peak-piloted deep network (PPDN) that uses a sample with peak expression (easy
sample) to supervise the intermediate feature responses for a sample of
non-peak expression (hard sample) of the same type and from the same subject.
The expression evolving process from non-peak expression to peak expression can
thus be implicitly embedded in the network to achieve the invariance to
expression intensities. A special purpose back-propagation procedure, peak
gradient suppression (PGS), is proposed for network training. It drives the
intermediate-layer feature responses of non-peak expression samples towards
those of the corresponding peak expression samples, while avoiding the inverse.
This avoids degrading the recognition capability for samples of peak expression
due to interference from their non-peak expression counterparts. Extensive
comparisons on two popular FER datasets, Oulu-CASIA and CK+, demonstrate the
superiority of the PPDN over state-ofthe-art FER methods, as well as the
advantages of both the network structure and the optimization strategy.
Moreover, it is shown that PPDN is a general architecture, extensible to other
tasks by proper definition of peak and non-peak samples. This is validated by
experiments that show state-of-the-art performance on pose-invariant face
recognition, using the Multi-PIE dataset.

 <dc:description>  To address the sequential changes of images including poses, in this paper we
propose a recurrent regression neural network(RRNN) framework to unify two
classic tasks of cross-pose face recognition on still images and video-based
face recognition. To imitate the changes of images, we explicitly construct the
potential dependencies of sequential images so as to regularize the final
learning model. By performing progressive transforms for sequentially adjacent
images, RRNN can adaptively memorize and forget the information that benefits
for the final classification. For face recognition of still images, given any
one image with any one pose, we recurrently predict the images with its
sequential poses to expect to capture some useful information of others poses.
For video-based face recognition, the recurrent regression takes one entire
sequence rather than one image as its input. We verify RRNN in static face
dataset MultiPIE and face video dataset YouTube Celebrities(YTC). The
comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed RRNN method.

 <dc:description>  Large alphabet source coding is a basic and well-studied problem in data
compression. It has many applications such as compression of natural language
text, speech and images. The classic perception of most commonly used methods
is that a source is best described over an alphabet which is at least as large
as the observed alphabet. In this work we challenge this approach and introduce
a conceptual framework in which a large alphabet source is decomposed into &quot;as
statistically independent as possible&quot; components. This decomposition allows us
to apply entropy encoding to each component separately, while benefiting from
their reduced alphabet size. We show that in many cases, such decomposition
results in a sum of marginal entropies which is only slightly greater than the
entropy of the source. Our suggested algorithm, based on a generalization of
the Binary Independent Component Analysis, is applicable for a variety of large
alphabet source coding setups. This includes the classical lossless
compression, universal compression and high-dimensional vector quantization. In
each of these setups, our suggested approach outperforms most commonly used
methods. Moreover, our proposed framework is significantly easier to implement
in most of these cases.

 <dc:title>A Search Algorithm for Simplicial Complexes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present the `Basic S*' algorithm for computing shortest path through a
metric simplicial complex. In particular, given a metric graph, $G$, which is
constructed as a discrete representation of an underlying configuration space
(a larger &quot;continuous&quot; space/manifold typically of dimension greater than one),
we consider the Rips complex, $\mathcal{R}(G)$, associated with it. Such a
complex, and hence shortest paths in it, represent the underlying metric space
more closely than what the graph does. While discrete graph representations of
continuous spaces is convenient for motion planning in configuration spaces of
robotic systems, the metric induced in them by the ambient configuration space
is significantly different from the metric of the configuration space itself.
We remedy this problem using the simplicial complex representation. Our
algorithm requires only an abstract graph, $G=(V,E)$, and a cost/length
function, $d:E\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$, as inputs, and no global information
such as an embedding or a global coordinate chart is required. The complexity
of the Basic S* algorithm is comparable to that of Dijkstra's search, but, as
the results presented in this paper demonstrate, the shortest paths obtained
using the proposed algorithm represent/approximate the geodesic paths in the
original metric space significantly more closely.

 <dc:description>  Given integers d &gt;= 1, and g &gt;= 2, a g-addition chain for d is a sequence of
integers a_0=1, a_1, a_2,..., a_{r-1}, a_r=d where
a_i=a_{j_1}+a_{j_2}+...+a_{j_k}, with 2 =&lt; k =&lt; g, and 0 =&lt; j_1 =&lt; j_2 =&lt; ...
=&lt; j_k =&lt; i-1. The length of a g-addition chain is r, the number of terms
following 1 in the sequence. We denote by l_g(d) the length of a shortest
addition chain for d. Many results have been established in the case g=2. Our
aim is to establish the same sort of results for arbitrary fixed g. In
particular, we adapt methods for constructing g-addition chains when g=2 to the
case g&gt;2 and we study the asymptotic behavior of l_g.

 <dc:description>  Ultra dense cloud small cell network (UDCSNet), which combines cloud
computing and massive deployment of small cells, is a promising technology for
the fifth-generation (5G) LTE-U mobile communications because it can
accommodate the anticipated explosive growth of mobile users' data traffic. As
a result, fronthauling becomes a challenging problem in 5G LTE-U UDCSNet. In
this article, we present an overview of the challenges and requirements of the
fronthaul technology in 5G \mbox{LTE-U} UDCSNets. We survey the advantages and
challenges for various candidate fronthaul technologies such as optical fiber,
millimeter-wave based unlicensed spectrum, Wi-Fi based unlicensed spectrum, sub
6GHz based licensed spectrum, and free-space optical based unlicensed spectrum.

 <dc:title>Robust Control for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications using Average

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Control systems that satisfy temporal logic specifications have become
increasingly popular due to their applicability to robotic systems. However,
existing methods are computationally demanding, especially if the problem size
becomes too large. In this paper, a robust and computationally efficient
framework consisting of signal temporal logic and model predictive control is
proposed. We introduce novel quantitative semantics for signal temporal logic,
called discrete average space robustness, that are directly incorporated into
the cost function of the model predictive controller. The convex optimization
problem entailed in this framework can be written as a quadratic program and
results in robustness with respect to the specification. Furthermore, we define
the predicate robustness degree as a new robustness notion and indicate that
discrete average space robustness results in a greater predicate robustness
degree than space robustness, quantitative semantics that have previously been
proposed for signal temporal logic. Simulations of a coupled two-tank process
are provided in the end.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider single-hop topologies with saturated transmitting nodes, using
IEEE~802.11 DCF for medium access. However, unlike the conventional WiFi, we
study systems where one or more of the protocol parameters are different from
the standard, and/or where the propagation delays among the nodes are not
negligible compared to the duration of a backoff slot. We observe that for
several classes of protocol parameters, and for large propagation delays, such
systems exhibit a certain performance anomaly known as short term unfairness,
which may lead to severe performance degradation. The standard fixed point
analysis technique (and its simple extensions) do not predict the system
behavior well in such cases; a mean field model based asymptotic approach also
is not adequate to predict the performance for networks of practical sizes in
such cases. We provide a detailed stochastic model that accurately captures the
system evolution. Since an exact analysis of this model is computationally
intractable, we develop a novel approximate, but accurate, analysis that uses a
parsimonious state representation for computational tractability. Apart from
providing insights into the system behavior, the analytical method is also able
to quantify the extent of short term unfairness in the system, and can
therefore be used for tuning the protocol parameters to achieve desired
throughput and fairness objectives.

 <dc:title>Redundancy-free Verbalization of Individuals for Ontology Validation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigate the problem of verbalizing Web Ontology Language (OWL) axioms
of domain ontologies in this paper. The existing approaches address the problem
of fidelity of verbalized OWL texts to OWL semantics by exploring different
ways of expressing the same OWL axiom in various linguistic forms. They also
perform grouping and aggregating of the natural language (NL) sentences that
are generated corresponding to each OWL statement into a comprehensible
structure. However, no efforts have been taken to try out a semantic reduction
at logical level to remove redundancies and repetitions, so that the reduced
set of axioms can be used for generating a more meaningful and
human-understandable (what we call redundancy-free) text. Our experiments show
that, formal semantic reduction at logical level is very helpful to generate
redundancy-free descriptions of ontology entities. In this paper, we
particularly focus on generating descriptions of individuals of SHIQ based
ontologies. The details of a case study are provided to support the usefulness
of the redundancy-free NL descriptions of individuals, in knowledge validation
application.

 <dc:description>  Detecting pedestrian has been arguably addressed as a special topic beyond
general object detection. Although recent deep learning object detectors such
as Fast/Faster R-CNN [1, 2] have shown excellent performance for general object
detection, they have limited success for detecting pedestrian, and previous
leading pedestrian detectors were in general hybrid methods combining
hand-crafted and deep convolutional features. In this paper, we investigate
issues involving Faster R-CNN [2] for pedestrian detection. We discover that
the Region Proposal Network (RPN) in Faster R-CNN indeed performs well as a
stand-alone pedestrian detector, but surprisingly, the downstream classifier
degrades the results. We argue that two reasons account for the unsatisfactory
accuracy: (i) insufficient resolution of feature maps for handling small
instances, and (ii) lack of any bootstrapping strategy for mining hard negative
examples. Driven by these observations, we propose a very simple but effective
baseline for pedestrian detection, using an RPN followed by boosted forests on
shared, high-resolution convolutional feature maps. We comprehensively evaluate
this method on several benchmarks (Caltech, INRIA, ETH, and KITTI), presenting
competitive accuracy and good speed. Code will be made publicly available.

 <dc:description>  The importance of sleep is paramount for maintaining physical, emotional and
mental wellbeing. Though the relationship between sleep and physical activity
is known to be important, it is not yet fully understood. The explosion in
popularity of actigraphy and wearable devices, provides a unique opportunity to
understand this relationship. Leveraging this information source requires new
tools to be developed to facilitate data-driven research for sleep and activity
patient-recommendations.
  In this paper we explore the use of deep learning to build sleep quality
prediction models based on actigraphy data. We first use deep learning as a
pure model building device by performing human activity recognition (HAR) on
raw sensor data, and using deep learning to build sleep prediction models. We
compare the deep learning models with those build using classical approaches,
i.e. logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest and adaboost.
Secondly, we employ the advantage of deep learning with its ability to handle
high dimensional datasets. We explore several deep learning models on the raw
wearable sensor output without performing HAR or any other feature extraction.
  Our results show that using a convolutional neural network on the raw
wearables output improves the predictive value of sleep quality from physical
activity, by an additional 8% compared to state-of-the-art non-deep learning
approaches, which itself shows a 15% improvement over current practice.
Moreover, utilizing deep learning on raw data eliminates the need for data
pre-processing and simplifies the overall workflow to analyze actigraphy data
for sleep and physical activity research.

 <dc:title>Joint Source-Channel Secrecy Using Uncoded Schemes: Towards Secure

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates a joint source-channel secrecy problem for the
Shannon cipher broadcast system. We suppose list secrecy is applied, i.e., a
wiretapper is allowed to produce a list of reconstruction sequences and the
secrecy is measured by the minimum distortion over the entire list. For
discrete communication cases, we propose a permutation-based uncoded scheme,
which cascades a random permutation with a symbol-by-symbol mapping. Using this
scheme, we derive an inner bound for the admissible region of secret key rate,
list rate, wiretapper distortion, and distortions of legitimate users. For the
converse part, we easily obtain an outer bound for the admissible region from
an existing result. Comparing the outer bound with the inner bound shows that
the proposed scheme is optimal under certain conditions. Besides, we extend the
proposed scheme to the scalar and vector Gaussian communication scenarios, and
characterize the corresponding performance as well. For these two cases, we
also propose another uncoded scheme, orthogonal-transform-based scheme, which
achieves the same performance as the permutation-based scheme. Interestingly,
by introducing the random permutation or the random orthogonal transform into
the traditional uncoded scheme, the proposed uncoded schemes, on one hand,
provide a certain level of secrecy, and on the other hand, do not lose any
performance in terms of the distortions for legitimate users.

 <dc:description>  3D action recognition - analysis of human actions based on 3D skeleton data -
becomes popular recently due to its succinctness, robustness, and
view-invariant representation. Recent attempts on this problem suggested to
develop RNN-based learning methods to model the contextual dependency in the
temporal domain. In this paper, we extend this idea to spatio-temporal domains
to analyze the hidden sources of action-related information within the input
data over both domains concurrently. Inspired by the graphical structure of the
human skeleton, we further propose a more powerful tree-structure based
traversal method. To handle the noise and occlusion in 3D skeleton data, we
introduce new gating mechanism within LSTM to learn the reliability of the
sequential input data and accordingly adjust its effect on updating the
long-term context information stored in the memory cell. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 4 challenging benchmark datasets for 3D human
action analysis.

 <dc:title>Latent Tree Language Model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Brychcin, Tomas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce Latent Tree Language Model (LTLM), a novel
approach to language modeling that encodes syntax and semantics of a given
sentence as a tree of word roles.
  The learning phase iteratively updates the trees by moving nodes according to
Gibbs sampling. We introduce two algorithms to infer a tree for a given
sentence. The first one is based on Gibbs sampling. It is fast, but does not
guarantee to find the most probable tree. The second one is based on dynamic
programming. It is slower, but guarantees to find the most probable tree. We
provide comparison of both algorithms.
  We combine LTLM with 4-gram Modified Kneser-Ney language model via linear
interpolation. Our experiments with English and Czech corpora show significant
perplexity reductions (up to 46% for English and 49% for Czech) compared with
standalone 4-gram Modified Kneser-Ney language model.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we initiate the study of the dynamic maintenance of
$2$-edge-connectivity relationships in directed graphs. We present an algorithm
that can update the $2$-edge-connected blocks of a directed graph with $n$
vertices through a sequence of $m$ edge insertions in a total of $O(mn)$ time.
After each insertion, we can answer the following queries in asymptotically
optimal time: (i) Test in constant time if two query vertices $v$ and $w$ are
$2$-edge-connected. Moreover, if $v$ and $w$ are not $2$-edge-connected, we can
produce in constant time a &quot;witness&quot; of this property, by exhibiting an edge
that is contained in all paths from $v$ to $w$ or in all paths from $w$ to $v$.
(ii) Report in $O(n)$ time all the $2$-edge-connected blocks of $G$. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first dynamic algorithm for $2$-connectivity
problems on directed graphs, and it matches the best known bounds for simpler
problems, such as incremental transitive closure.

 <dc:description>  We propose a geometric model-free causality measurebased on multivariate
delay embedding that can efficiently detect linear and nonlinear causal
interactions between time series with no prior information. We then exploit the
proposed causal interaction measure in real MEG data analysis. The results are
used to construct effective connectivity maps of brain activity to decode
different categories of visual stimuli. Moreover, we discovered that the
MEG-based effective connectivity maps as a response to structured images
exhibit more geometric patterns, as disclosed by analyzing the evolution of
toplogical structures of the underlying networks using persistent homology.
Extensive simulation and experimental result have been carried out to
substantiate the capabilities of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Controlling stochastic reactions networks is a challenging problem with
important implications in various fields such as systems and synthetic biology.
Various regulation motifs have been discovered or posited over the recent
years, the most recent one being the so-called Antithetic Integral Control
(AIC) motif in Briat et al. (Cell Systems, 2016). Several favorable properties
for the AIC motif have been demonstrated for classes of reaction networks that
satisfy certain irreducibility, ergodicity and output controllability
conditions. Here we address the problem of verifying these conditions for large
sets of reaction networks with fixed topology using two different approaches.
The first one is quantitative and relies on the notion of interval matrices
while the second one is qualitative and is based on sign properties of
matrices. The obtained results lie in the same spirit as those obtained in
Briat et al. (Cell Systems, 2016) where properties of reaction networks are
independently characterized in terms of control theoretic concepts, linear
programming conditions and graph theoretic conditions.

 <dc:description>  Given a graph G = (V,E) with a root r in V, positive capacities {c(e)|e in
E}, and non-negative lengths {l(e)|e in E}, the minimum-length (rooted) edge
capacitated Steiner tree problem is to find a tree in G of minimum total
length, rooted at r, spanning a given subset T of vertices, and such that, for
each e in E, there are at most c(e) paths, linking r to vertices in T, that
contain e. We study the complexity and approximability of the problem,
considering several relevant parameters such as the number of terminals, the
edge lengths and the minimum and maximum edge capacities. For all but one
combinations of assumptions regarding these parameters, we settle the question,
giving a complete characterization that separates tractable cases from hard
ones. The only remaining open case is proved to be equivalent to a
long-standing open problem. We also prove close relations between our problem
and classical Steiner tree as well as vertex-disjoint paths problems.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach to training neural networks to generate sequences
using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). Current
log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their
training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their
previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem
by introducing a \textit{critic} network that is trained to predict the value
of an output token, given the policy of an \textit{actor} network. This results
in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to
directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we
leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the
traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth
output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a
synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves
the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks,
such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the outage probability and the throughput of relay
networks with wireless information and energy transfer where the relays harvest
energy from the transmitted radio-frequency signal of the source. Considering
different power consumption models, we derive the outage probability for both
adaptive and non-adaptive power allocations at the relay. With a total energy
consumption constraint at the source, we provide closed-form expressions for
the optimal time sharing and power allocation between the source energy and
information transfer signals as well as the optimal relay positioning such that
the outage probability is minimized. Finally, we extend our analysis to
multi-relay networks. We show that with perfect channel state information (CSI)
available at the relays and $N$ relays the opportunistic relaying scheme
achieves diversity order of $\frac{N+1}{2}$. Also, we analyze the opportunistic
relaying with partial CSI where either the source-relay or the
relay-destination CSI is provided at its corresponding transmit terminal, and
prove that the relay selection based on the source-relay CSI outperforms the
relay selection based on the relay-destination CSI, in terms of outage
probability. The analytical and simulation results demonstrate the efficiency
of wireless energy and information transfer systems in different conditions.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of selling a single item to one of $n$ bidders who
arrive sequentially with values drawn independently from identical
distributions, and ask how much more revenue can be obtained by posting
discriminatory prices to individual bidders rather than the same anonymous
price to all of them. The ratio between the maximum revenue from discriminatory
pricing and that from anonymous pricing is at most $2-1/n$ for arbitrary
distributions and at most $1/(1-(1-1/n)^n)\leq e/(e-1)\approx 1.582$ for
regular distributions, and these bounds can in fact be obtained by using one of
the discriminatory prices as an anonymous one. The bounds are shown via a
relaxation of the discriminatory pricing problem rather than virtual values and
thus apply to distributions without a density, and they are tight for all
values of $n$. For a class of distributions that includes the uniform and the
exponential distribution we show the maximization of revenue to be equivalent
to the maximization of welfare with an additional bidder, in the sense that
both use the same discriminatory prices. The problem of welfare maximization is
the well-known Cayley-Moser problem, and this connection can be used to
establish that the revenue gap between discriminatory and anonymous pricing is
approximately $1.037$ for the uniform distribution and approximately $1.073$
for the exponential distribution.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of extending a function $f$ defined on a training data
$\mathcal{C}$ on an unknown manifold $\mathbb{X}$ to the entire manifold and a
tubular neighborhood of this manifold is considered in this paper. For
$\mathbb{X}$ embedded in a high dimensional ambient Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^D$, a deep learning algorithm is developed for finding a local
coordinate system for the manifold {\bf without eigen--decomposition}, which
reduces the problem to the classical problem of function approximation on a low
dimensional cube. Deep nets (or multilayered neural networks) are proposed to
accomplish this approximation scheme by using the training data. Our methods do
not involve such optimization techniques as back--propagation, while assuring
optimal (a priori) error bounds on the output in terms of the number of
derivatives of the target function. In addition, these methods are universal,
in that they do not require a prior knowledge of the smoothness of the target
function, but adjust the accuracy of approximation locally and automatically,
depending only upon the local smoothness of the target function. Our ideas are
easily extended to solve both the pre--image problem and the out--of--sample
extension problem, with a priori bounds on the growth of the function thus
extended.

 <dc:description>  This study explores a new security problem existing in various
state-of-the-art quantum private comparison (QPC) protocols, where a malicious
third-party (TP) announces fake comparison (or intermediate) results. In this
case, the participants could eventually be led to a wrong direction and the QPC
will become fraudulent. In order to resolve this problem, a new level of
trustworthiness for TP is defined and a new QPC protocol is proposed, where a
second TP is introduced to monitor the first one. Once a TP announces a fake
comparison (or intermediate) result, participants can detect the fraud
immediately. Besides, due to the introduction of the second TP, the proposed
protocol allows strangers to compare their secrets privately, whereas the
state-of-the-art QPCs require the involved clients to know each other before
running the protocol.

 <dc:description>  We consider the observability model in networks with arbitrary topologies. We
introduce a system of coupled nonlinear equations, valid under the locally
tree-like ansatz, to describe the size of the largest observable cluster as a
function of the fraction of directly observable nodes present in the network.
We perform a systematic analysis on 95 real-world graphs and compare our
theoretical predictions with numerical simulations of the observability model.
Our method provides almost perfect predictions in the majority of the cases,
even for networks with very large values of the clustering coefficient.
Potential applications of our theory include the development of efficient and
scalable algorithms for real-time surveillance of social networks, and
monitoring of technological networks.

 <dc:title>Exploiting Symmetry and/or Manhattan Properties for 3D Object Structure
  Estimation from Single and Multiple Images</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Many man-made objects have intrinsic symmetries and Manhattan structure. By
assuming an orthographic projection model, this paper addresses the estimation
of 3D structures and camera projection using symmetry and/or Manhattan
structure cues, which occur when the input is single- or multiple-image from
the same category, e.g., multiple different cars. Specifically, analysis on the
single image case implies that Manhattan alone is sufficient to recover the
camera projection, and then the 3D structure can be reconstructed uniquely
exploiting symmetry. However, Manhattan structure can be difficult to observe
from a single image due to occlusion. To this end, we extend to the
multiple-image case which can also exploit symmetry but does not require
Manhattan axes. We propose a novel rigid structure from motion method,
exploiting symmetry and using multiple images from the same category as input.
Experimental results on the Pascal3D+ dataset show that our method
significantly outperforms baseline methods.

 <dc:title>A No-Go Theorem for Derandomized Parallel Repetition: Beyond

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work we show a barrier towards proving a randomness-efficient
parallel repetition, a promising avenue for achieving many tight
inapproximability results. Feige and Kilian (STOC'95) proved an impossibility
result for randomness-efficient parallel repetition for two prover games with
small degree, i.e., when each prover has only few possibilities for the
question of the other prover. In recent years, there have been indications that
randomness-efficient parallel repetition (also called derandomized parallel
repetition) might be possible for games with large degree, circumventing the
impossibility result of Feige and Kilian. In particular, Dinur and Meir
(CCC'11) construct games with large degree whose repetition can be derandomized
using a theorem of Impagliazzo, Kabanets and Wigderson (SICOMP'12). However,
obtaining derandomized parallel repetition theorems that would yield optimal
inapproximability results has remained elusive.
  This paper presents an explanation for the current impasse in progress, by
proving a limitation on derandomized parallel repetition. We formalize two
properties which we call &quot;fortification-friendliness&quot; and &quot;yields robust
embeddings.&quot; We show that any proof of derandomized parallel repetition
achieving almost-linear blow-up cannot both (a) be fortification-friendly and
(b) yield robust embeddings. Unlike Feige and Kilian, we do not require the
small degree assumption.
  Given that virtually all existing proofs of parallel repetition, including
the derandomized parallel repetition result of Dinur and Meir, share these two
properties, our no-go theorem highlights a major barrier to achieving
almost-linear derandomized parallel repetition.

 <dc:description>  A unified deep neural network, denoted the multi-scale CNN (MS-CNN), is
proposed for fast multi-scale object detection. The MS-CNN consists of a
proposal sub-network and a detection sub-network. In the proposal sub-network,
detection is performed at multiple output layers, so that receptive fields
match objects of different scales. These complementary scale-specific detectors
are combined to produce a strong multi-scale object detector. The unified
network is learned end-to-end, by optimizing a multi-task loss. Feature
upsampling by deconvolution is also explored, as an alternative to input
upsampling, to reduce the memory and computation costs. State-of-the-art object
detection performance, at up to 15 fps, is reported on datasets, such as KITTI
and Caltech, containing a substantial number of small objects.

 <dc:description>  The equational complexity function
$\beta_\mathscr{V}:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ of an equational class of algebras
$\mathscr{V}$ bounds the size of equation required to determine membership of
$n$-element algebras in $\mathscr{V}$. Known examples of finitely generated
varieties $\mathscr{V}$ with unbounded equational complexity have growth in
$\Omega(n^c)$, usually for $c\geq \frac{1}{2}$. We show that much slower growth
is possible, exhibiting $O(\log_2^3(n))$ growth amongst varieties of
semilattice ordered inverse semigroups and additive idempotent semirings. We
also examine a quasivariety analogue of equational complexity, and show that a
finite group has polylogarithmic quasi-equational complexity function, bounded
if and only if all Sylow subgroups are abelian.

 <dc:title>Coherence Disparity in Broadcast and Multiple Access Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fadel, Mohamed</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Nosratinia, Aria</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Individual links in a wireless network may experience unequal fading
coherence times due to differences in mobility or scattering environment, a
practical scenario where the fundamental limits of communication have been
mostly unknown. This paper studies broadcast and multiple access channels where
multiple receivers experience unequal fading block lengths, and channel state
information (CSI) is not available at the transmitter(s), or for free at any
receiver. In other words, the cost of acquiring CSI at the receiver is fully
accounted for in the degrees of freedom. In the broadcast channel, the method
of product superposition is employed to find the achievable degrees of freedom.
We start with unequal coherence intervals with integer ratios. As long as the
coherence time is at least twice the number of transmit and receive antennas,
these degrees of freedom meet the upper bound in four cases: when the
transmitter has fewer antennas than the receivers, when all receivers have the
same number of antennas, when the coherence time of one receiver is much
shorter than all others, or when all receivers have identical block fading
intervals. The degrees of freedom region of the broadcast under identical
coherence times was also previously unknown and is settled by the results of
this paper. The disparity of coherence times leads to gains that are distinct
from those arising from other techniques such as spatial multiplexing or
multi-user diversity; this class of gains is denoted coherence diversity. The
inner bounds are further extended to the case of multiple receivers
experiencing fading block lengths of arbitrary ratio or alignment. Also, in the
multiple access channel with unequal coherence times, achievable and outer
bounds on the degrees of freedom are obtained.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a fast content-based video querying system for
large-scale video search. The proposed system is distinguished from similar
works with two major contributions. First contribution is superiority of joint
usage of repeated content representation and efficient hashing mechanisms.
Repeated content representation is utilized with a simple yet robust feature,
which is based on edge energy of frames. Each of the representation is
converted into hash code with Hamming Embedding method for further queries.
Second contribution is novel queue-based voting scheme that leads to modest
memory requirements with gradual memory allocation capability, contrary to
complete brute-force temporal voting schemes. This aspect enables us to make
queries on large video databases conveniently, even on commodity computers with
limited memory capacity. Our results show that the system can respond to video
queries on a large video database with fast query times, high recall rate and
very low memory and disk requirements.

leakage. The experimented channels are close to slow fading channels, and coset

results show to which extent coset coding can provide confidentiality, as a
function of Eve's position, and the amount of randomness used.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents the results of a comprehensive investigation of complex
linear physical-layer network (PNC) in two-way relay channels (TWRC). A
critical question at relay R is as follows: &quot;Given channel gain ratio $\eta =
h_A/h_B$, where $h_A$ and $h_B$ are the complex channel gains from nodes A and
B to relay R, respectively, what is the optimal coefficients $(\alpha,\beta)$
that minimizes the symbol error rate (SER) of $w_N=\alpha w_A+\beta w_B$ when
we attempt to detect $w_N$ in the presence of noise?&quot; Our contributions with
respect to this question are as follows: (1) We put forth a general
Gaussian-integer formulation for complex linear PNC in which $\alpha,\beta,w_A,
w_B$, and $w_N$ are elements of a finite field of Gaussian integers, that is,
the field of $\mathbb{Z}[i]/q$ where $q$ is a Gaussian prime. Previous vector
formulation, in which $w_A$, $w_B$, and $w_N$ were represented by
$2$-dimensional vectors and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ were represented by $2\times
2$ matrices, corresponds to a subcase of our Gaussian-integer formulation where
$q$ is real prime only. Extension to Gaussian prime $q$, where $q$ can be
complex, gives us a larger set of signal constellations to achieve different
rates at different SNR. (2) We show how to divide the complex plane of $\eta$
into different Voronoi regions such that the $\eta$ within each Voronoi region
share the same optimal PNC mapping $(\alpha_{opt},\beta_{opt})$. We uncover the
structure of the Voronoi regions that allows us to compute a minimum-distance
metric that characterizes the SER of $w_N$ under optimal PNC mapping
$(\alpha_{opt},\beta_{opt})$. Overall, the contributions in (1) and (2) yield a
toolset for a comprehensive understanding of complex linear PNC in
$\mathbb{Z}[i]/q$. We believe investigation of linear PNC beyond
$\mathbb{Z}[i]/q$ can follow the same approach.

 <dc:description>  The induced arboricity of a graph $G$ is the smallest number of induced
forests covering the edges of $G$. This is a well-defined parameter bounded
from above by the number of edges of $G$ when each forest in a cover consists
of exactly one edge. Not all edges of a graph necessarily belong to induced
forests with larger components. For $k\geq 1$, we call an edge $k$-valid if it
is contained in an induced tree on $k$ edges. The $k$-strong induced arboricity
of $G$, denoted by $f_k(G)$, is the smallest number of induced forests with
components of sizes at least $k$ that cover all $k$-valid edges in $G$. This
parameter is highly non-monotone.
  However, we prove that for any proper minor-closed graph class $\mathcal{C}$,
and more generally for any class of bounded expansion, and any $k \geq 1$, the
maximum value of $f_k(G)$ for $G \in \mathcal{C}$ is bounded from above by a
constant depending only on $\mathcal{C}$ and $k$. This implies that the
adjacent closed vertex-distinguishing number of graphs from a class of bounded
expansion is bounded by a constant depending only on the class. We further
prove that $f_2(G) \leq 3\binom{t+1}{3}$ for any graph $G$ of tree-width~$t$
and that $f_k(G) \leq (2k)^d$ for any graph of tree-depth $d$. In addition, we
prove that $f_2(G) \leq 310$ when $G$ is planar.

 <dc:description>  The hourglass model is a widely used as a means of describing the design of
the Internet, and can be found in the introduction of many modern textbooks. It
arguably also applies to the design of other successful spanning layers,
notably the Unix operating system kernel interface, meaning the primitive
system calls and the interactions between user processes and the kernel. The
impressive success of the Internet has led to a wider interest in using the
hourglass model in other layered systems, with the goal of achieving similar
results. However, application of the hourglass model has often led to
controversy, perhaps in part because the language in which it has been
expressed has been informal, and arguments for its validity have not been
precise. Making a start on formalizing such an argument is the goal of this
paper.

 <dc:description>  From a machine learning point of view, identifying a subset of relevant
features from a real data set can be useful to improve the results achieved by
classification methods and to reduce their time and space complexity. To
achieve this goal, feature selection methods are usually employed. These
approaches assume that the data contains redundant or irrelevant attributes
that can be eliminated. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to manage
the optimization problem that is at the foundation of the Mutual Information
feature selection methods. Furthermore, our novel approach is able to estimate
automatically the number of dimensions to retain. The quality of our method is
confirmed by the promising results achieved on standard real data sets.

 <dc:description>  We propose a decoding algorithm for a class of convolutional codes called
skew BCH convolutional codes. These are convolutional codes of designed Hamming
distance endowed with a cyclic structure yielding a left ideal of a
non-commutative ring (a quotient of a skew polynomial ring). In this setting,
right and left division algorithms exist, so our algorithm follows the
guidelines of the Sugiyama's procedure for finding the error locator and error
evaluator polynomials for BCH block codes.

 <dc:description>  Factorization machines (FMs) are a supervised learning approach that can use
second-order feature combinations even when the data is very high-dimensional.
Unfortunately, despite increasing interest in FMs, there exists to date no
efficient training algorithm for higher-order FMs (HOFMs). In this paper, we
present the first generic yet efficient algorithms for training arbitrary-order
HOFMs. We also present new variants of HOFMs with shared parameters, which
greatly reduce model size and prediction times while maintaining similar
accuracy. We demonstrate the proposed approaches on four different link
prediction tasks.

 <dc:title>Approximating Multicut and the Demand Graph</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the minimum Multicut problem, the input is an edge-weighted supply graph
$G=(V,E)$ and a simple demand graph $H=(V,F)$. Either $G$ and $H$ are directed
(DMulC) or both are undirected (UMulC). The goal is to remove a minimum weight
set of edges in $G$ such that there is no path from $s$ to $t$ in the remaining
graph for any $(s,t) \in F$. UMulC admits an $O(\log k)$-approximation where
$k$ is the vertex cover size of $H$ while the best known approximation for
DMulC is $\min\{k, \tilde{O}(n^{11/23})\}$. These approximations are obtained
by proving corresponding results on the multicommodity flow-cut gap. In
contrast to these results some special cases of Multicut, such as the
well-studied Multiway Cut problem, admit a constant factor approximation in
both undirected and directed graphs. Motivated by both concrete instances from
applications and abstract considerations, we consider the role that the
structure of the demand graph $H$ plays in determining the approximability of
Multicut.
  In undirected graphs our main result is a $2$-approximation in $n^{O(t)}$
time when the demand graph $H$ excludes an induced matching of size $t$. This
gives a constant factor approximation for a specific demand graph that
motivated this work.
  In contrast to undirected graphs, we prove that in directed graphs such
approximation algorithms can not exist. Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture
(UGC), for a large class of fixed demand graphs DMulC cannot be approximated to
a factor better than worst-case flow-cut gap. As a consequence we prove that
for any fixed $k$, assuming UGC, DMulC with $k$ demand pairs is hard to
approximate to within a factor better than $k$. On the positive side, we prove
an approximation of $k$ when the demand graph excludes certain graphs as an
induced subgraph. This generalizes the Multiway Cut result to a much larger
class of demand graphs.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we consider the task of generating highly-realistic images of a
given face with a redirected gaze. We treat this problem as a specific instance
of conditional image generation and suggest a new deep architecture that can
handle this task very well as revealed by numerical comparison with prior art
and a user study. Our deep architecture performs coarse-to-fine warping with an
additional intensity correction of individual pixels. All these operations are
performed in a feed-forward manner, and the parameters associated with
different operations are learned jointly in the end-to-end fashion. After
learning, the resulting neural network can synthesize images with manipulated
gaze, while the redirection angle can be selected arbitrarily from a certain
range and provided as an input to the network.

 <dc:description>  Person re-identification is an open and challenging problem in computer
vision. Majority of the efforts have been spent either to design the best
feature representation or to learn the optimal matching metric. Most approaches
have neglected the problem of adapting the selected features or the learned
model over time. To address such a problem, we propose a temporal model
adaptation scheme with human in the loop. We first introduce a
similarity-dissimilarity learning method which can be trained in an incremental
fashion by means of a stochastic alternating directions methods of multipliers
optimization procedure. Then, to achieve temporal adaptation with limited human
effort, we exploit a graph-based approach to present the user only the most
informative probe-gallery matches that should be used to update the model.
Results on three datasets have shown that our approach performs on par or even
better than state-of-the-art approaches while reducing the manual pairwise
labeling effort by about 80%.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, machine learning based single image super resolution (SR)
approaches focus on jointly learning representations for high-resolution (HR)
and low-resolution (LR) image patch pairs to improve the quality of the
super-resolved images. However, due to treat all image pixels equally without
considering the salient structures, these approaches usually fail to produce
visual pleasant images with sharp edges and fine details. To address this
issue, in this work we present a new novel SR approach, which replaces the main
building blocks of the classical interpolation pipeline by a flexible,
content-adaptive deep neural networks. In particular, two well-designed
structure-aware components, respectively capturing local- and holistic- image
contents, are naturally incorporated into the fully-convolutional
representation learning to enhance the image sharpness and naturalness.
Extensively evaluations on several standard benchmarks (e.g., Set5, Set14 and
BSD200) demonstrate that our approach can achieve superior results, especially
on the image with salient structures, over many existing state-of-the-art SR
methods under both quantitative and qualitative measures.

 <dc:title>Doubly Massive mmWave MIMO Systems: Using Very Large Antenna Arrays at

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the key features of next generation wireless communication systems
will be the use of frequencies in the range 10-100GHz (aka mmWave band) in
densely populated indoor and outdoor scenarios. Due to the reduced wavelength,
antenna arrays with a large number of antennas can be packed in very small
volumes, making thus it possible to consider, at least in principle,
communication links wherein not only the base-station, but also the user
device, are equipped with very large antenna arrays. We denote this
configuration as a &quot;doubly-massive&quot; MIMO wireless link. This paper introduces
the concept of doubly massive MIMO systems at mmWave, showing that at mmWave
the fundamentals of the massive MIMO regime are completely different from what
happens at conventional sub-6 GHz cellular frequencies. It is shown for
instance that the multiplexing capabilities of the channel and its rank are no
longer ruled by the number of transmit and receive antennas, but rather by the
number of scattering clusters in the surrounding environment. The implications
of the doubly massive MIMO regime on the transceiver processing, on the system
energy efficiency and on the system throughput are also discussed.

 <dc:description>  Social Networks allow users to self-present by sharing personal contents with
others which may add comments. Recent studies highlighted how the emotions
expressed in a post affect others' posts, eliciting a congruent emotion. So
far, no studies have yet investigated the emotional coherence between wall
posts and its comments. This research evaluated posts and comments mood of
Facebook profiles, analyzing their linguistic features, and a measure to assess
an excessive self-presentation was introduced. Two new experimental measures
were built, describing the emotional loading (positive and negative) of posts
and comments, and the mood correspondence between them was evaluated. The
profiles &quot;empathy&quot;, the mood coherence between post and comments, was used to
investigate the relation between an excessive self-presentation and the
emotional coherence of a profile. Participants publish a higher average number
of posts with positive mood. To publish an emotional post corresponds to get
more likes, comments and receive a coherent mood of comments, confirming the
emotional contagion effect reported in literature. Finally, the more empathetic
profiles are characterized by an excessive self-presentation, having more
posts, and receiving more comments and likes. To publish emotional contents
appears to be functional to receive more comments and likes, fulfilling needs
of attention-seeking.

 <dc:title>Worst-case Redundancy of Optimal Binary AIFV Codes and their Extended

 <dc:description>  Binary AIFV codes are lossless codes that generalize the class of
instantaneous FV codes. The code uses two code trees and assigns source symbols
to incomplete internal nodes as well as to leaves. AIFV codes are empirically
shown to attain better compression ratio than Huffman codes. Nevertheless, an
upper bound on the redundancy of optimal binary AIFV codes is only known to be
1, which is the same as the bound of Huffman codes. In this paper, the upper
bound is improved to 1/2, which is shown to coincide with the worst-case
redundancy of the codes. Along with this, the worst-case redundancy is derived
in terms of $p_{\max}\geq$1/2, where $p_{\max}$ is the probability of the most
likely source symbol. Additionally, we propose an extension of binary AIFV
codes, which use $m$ code trees and allow at most $m$-bit decoding delay. We
show that the worst-case redundancy of the extended binary AIFV codes is $1/m$
for $m \leq 4.$

 <dc:description>  Efficient usage of the knowledge provided by the Linked Data community is
often hindered by the need for domain experts to formulate the right SPARQL
queries to answer questions. For new questions they have to decide which
datasets are suitable and in which terminology and modelling style to phrase
the SPARQL query.
  In this work we present an evolutionary algorithm to help with this
challenging task. Given a training list of source-target node-pair examples our
algorithm can learn patterns (SPARQL queries) from a SPARQL endpoint. The
learned patterns can be visualised to form the basis for further investigation,
or they can be used to predict target nodes for new source nodes.
  Amongst others, we apply our algorithm to a dataset of several hundred human
associations (such as &quot;circle - square&quot;) to find patterns for them in DBpedia.
We show the scalability of the algorithm by running it against a SPARQL
endpoint loaded with &gt; 7.9 billion triples. Further, we use the resulting
SPARQL queries to mimic human associations with a Mean Average Precision (MAP)
of 39.9 % and a Recall@10 of 63.9 %.

 <dc:title>Topological Interference Management with User Admission Control via
  Riemannian Optimization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shi, Yuanming</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Topological interference management (TIM) provides a promising way to manage
interference only based on the network connectivity information. Previous works
on the TIM problem mainly focus on using the index coding approach and graph
theory to establish conditions of network topologies to achieve the feasibility
of topological interference management. In this paper, we propose a novel user
admission control approach via sparse and low-rank optimization to maximize the
number of admitted users for achieving the feasibility of topological
interference management. To assist efficient algorithms design for the
formulated rank-constrained (i.e., degrees-of-freedom (DoF) allocation) l0-norm
maximization (i.e., user capacity maximization) problem, we propose a
regularized smoothed l1- norm minimization approach to induce sparsity pattern,
thereby guiding the user selection. We further develop a Riemannian
trust-region algorithm to solve the resulting rank-constrained smooth
optimization problem via exploiting the quotient manifold of fixed-rank
matrices. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and near-optimal
performance of the proposed Riemannian algorithm to maximize the number of
admitted users for topological interference management.

 <dc:description>  We study several variations of line segment covering problem with
axis-parallel unit squares in $I\!\!R^2$. A set $S$ of $n$ line segments is
given. The objective is to find the minimum number of axis-parallel unit
squares which cover at least one end-point of each segment. The variations
depend on the orientation and length of the input segments. We prove some of
these problems to be NP-complete, and give constant factor approximation
algorithms for those problems. For some variations, we have polynomial time
exact algorithms. For the general version of the problem, where the segments
are of arbitrary length and orientation, and the squares are given as input, we
propose a factor 16 approximation result based on multilevel linear programming
relaxation technique, which may be useful for solving some other problems.
Further, we show that our problems have connections with the problems studied
by Arkin et al. 2015 on conflict-free covering problem. Our NP-completeness
results hold for more simplified types of objects than those of Arkin et al.
2015.

 <dc:description>  How can a machine learn to recognize visual attributes emerging out of online
community without a definitive supervised dataset? This paper proposes an
automatic approach to discover and analyze visual attributes from a noisy
collection of image-text data on the Web. Our approach is based on the
relationship between attributes and neural activations in the deep network. We
characterize the visual property of the attribute word as a divergence within
weakly-annotated set of images. We show that the neural activations are useful
for discovering and learning a classifier that well agrees with human
perception from the noisy real-world Web data. The empirical study suggests the
layered structure of the deep neural networks also gives us insights into the
perceptual depth of the given word. Finally, we demonstrate that we can utilize
highly-activating neurons for finding semantically relevant regions.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by the problem of zero-error broadcasting, we introduce a new
notion of graph capacity, termed $\rho$-capacity, that generalizes the Shannon
capacity of a graph. We derive upper and lower bounds on the $\rho$-capacity of
arbitrary graphs, and provide a Lov\'asz-type upper bound for regular graphs.
We study the behavior of the $\rho$-capacity under two graph operations: the
strong product and the disjoint union. Finally, we investigate the connection
between the structure of a graph and its $\rho$-capacity.

 <dc:description>  We provide a distribution-free test that can be used to determine whether any
two joint distributions $p$ and $q$ are statistically different by inspection
of a large enough set of samples. Following recent efforts from Long et al.
[1], we rely on joint kernel distribution embedding to extend the kernel
two-sample test of Gretton et al. [2] to the case of joint probability
distributions. Our main result can be directly applied to verify if a
dataset-shift has occurred between training and test distributions in a
learning framework, without further assuming the shift has occurred only in the
input, in the target or in the conditional distribution.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is to determine potential identifiers of students'
academic success in foundation mathematics course from the data logs of an
intelligent tutor. A cross-sectional study design was used. A sample of 58
records was extracted from the data-logs of an intelligent tutor, Assessment
for Learning using Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS). This data was triangulated with
the data collected from surveys. Two-step clustering, regression analysis,
paired-sample t-tests were applied to address the research questions. The
data-logs of ALEKS include information about number of topics practiced and
number of topics mastered. A derived attribute, which is the ratio of number of
topics mastered to number of topics practiced is found to be a predictor of
final marks. Students' prior knowledge and this derived attribute are
predictors of final grades with R square=42%. Students were asked to report
their preferred way of selecting topics as either sequential or random. Results
of paired sample t-test demonstrated that the students who selected topics in
sequential manner were able to retain their mastery of learning after the
summative assessment whereas the students who chose topics randomly were not
able to retain their mastery of learning.

 <dc:title>Session Types for Link Failures (Technical Report)</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We strive to use session type technology to prove behavioural properties of
fault-tolerant distributed algorithms. Session types are designed to abstractly
capture the structure of (even multi-party) communication protocols. The goal
of session types is the analysis and verification of the protocols' behavioural
properties. One important such property is progress, i.e., the absence of
(unintended) deadlock. Distributed algorithms often resemble (compositions of)
multi-party communication protocols. In contrast to protocols that are
typically studied with session types, they are often designed to cope with
system failures. An essential behavioural property is (successful) termination,
despite failures, but it is often elaborate to prove for distributed
algorithms.
  We extend multi-party session types (and multi-party session types with
nested sessions) by optional blocks that cover a limited class of link and
crash failures. This allows us to automatically derive termination of
distributed algorithms that come within these limits. To illustrate our
approach, we prove termination for an implementation of the *rotating
coordinator* Consensus algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We motivate and offer a formal definition of validation as it applies to
information fusion systems. Common definitions of validation compare the actual
state of the world with that derived by the fusion process. This definition
conflates properties of the fusion system with properties of systems that
intervene between the world and the fusion system. We propose an alternative
definition where validation of an information fusion system references a
standard fusion device, such as recognized human experts. We illustrate the
approach by describing the validation process implemented in RAID, a program
conducted by DARPA and focused on information fusion in adversarial, deceptive
environments.

 <dc:description>  In the presence of suitable power spaces, compactness of $\mathbf{X}$ can be
characterized as the singleton $\{X\}$ being open in the space
$\mathcal{O}(\mathbf{X})$ of open subsets of $\mathbf{X}$. Equivalently, this
means that universal quantification over a compact space preserves open
predicates.
  Using the language of represented spaces, one can make sense of notions such
as a $\Sigma^0_2$-subset of the space of $\Sigma^0_2$-subsets of a given space.
This suggests higher-order analogues to compactness: We can, e.g.~, investigate
the spaces $\mathbf{X}$ where $\{X\}$ is a $\Delta^0_2$-subset of the space of
$\Delta^0_2$-subsets of $\mathbf{X}$. Call this notion $\nabla$-compactness. As
$\Delta^0_2$ is self-dual, we find that both universal and existential
quantifier over $\nabla$-compact spaces preserve $\Delta^0_2$ predicates.
  Recall that a space is called Noetherian iff every subset is compact. Within
the setting of Quasi-Polish spaces, we can fully characterize the
$\nabla$-compact spaces: A Quasi-Polish space is Noetherian iff it is
$\nabla$-compact. Note that the restriction to Quasi-Polish spaces is
sufficiently general to include plenty of examples.

 <dc:description>  People can recognize scenes across many different modalities beyond natural
images. In this paper, we investigate how to learn cross-modal scene
representations that transfer across modalities. To study this problem, we
introduce a new cross-modal scene dataset. While convolutional neural networks
can categorize cross-modal scenes well, they also learn an intermediate
representation not aligned across modalities, which is undesirable for
cross-modal transfer applications. We present methods to regularize cross-modal
convolutional neural networks so that they have a shared representation that is
agnostic of the modality. Our experiments suggest that our scene representation
can help transfer representations across modalities for retrieval. Moreover,
our visualizations suggest that units emerge in the shared representation that
tend to activate on consistent concepts independently of the modality.

 <dc:description>  A method for automated quantification of the alignment of one-dimensional
nanostructures from microscopy imaging is presented. Nanostructure alignment
metrics are formulated and shown to able to rigorously quantify the
orientational order of nanostructures within a two-dimensional domain
(surface). A complementary image processing method is also presented which
enables robust processing of microscopy images where overlapping nanostructures
might be present. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of nanowire-covered
surfaces are analyzed using the presented methods and it is shown that past
single parameter alignment metrics are insufficient for highly aligned domains.
Through the use of multiple parameter alignment metrics, automated quantitative
analysis of SEM images is shown to be possible and the alignment
characteristics of different samples are able to be rigorously compared using a
similarity metric. The results of this work provide researchers in nanoscience
and nanotechnology with a rigorous method for the determination of
structure/property relationships where alignment of one-dimensional
nanostructures is significant.

 <dc:description>  Smart interactions among the smart grid, aggregators and EVs can bring
various benefits to all parties involved, e.g., improved reliability and safety
for the smart gird, increased profits for the aggregators, as well as enhanced
self benefit for EV customers. This survey focus on viewing this smart
interactions from an algorithmic perspective. In particular, important
dominating factors for coordinated charging from three different perspectives
are studied, in terms of smart grid oriented, aggregator oriented and customer
oriented smart charging. Firstly, for smart grid oriented EV charging, we
summarize various formulations proposed for load flattening, frequency
regulation and voltage regulation, then explore the nature and substantial
similarity among them. Secondly, for aggregator oriented EV charging, we
categorize the algorithmic approaches proposed by research works sharing this
perspective as direct and indirect coordinated control, and investigate these
approaches in detail. Thirdly, for customer oriented EV charging, based on a
commonly shared objective of reducing charging cost, we generalize different
formulations proposed by studied research works. Moreover, various uncertainty
issues, e.g., EV fleet uncertainty, electricity price uncertainty, regulation
demand uncertainty, etc., have been discussed according to the three
perspectives classified. At last, we discuss challenging issues that are
commonly confronted during modeling the smart interactions, and outline some
future research topics in this exciting area.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel formulation of the multiple object tracking problem which
integrates low and mid-level features. In particular, we formulate the tracking
problem as a quadratic program coupling detections and dense point
trajectories. Due to the computational complexity of the initial QP, we propose
an approximation by two auxiliary problems, a temporal and spatial association,
where the temporal subproblem can be efficiently solved by a linear program and
the spatial association by a clustering algorithm. The objective function of
the QP is used in order to find the optimal number of clusters, where each
cluster ideally represents one person. Evaluation is provided for multiple
scenarios, showing the superiority of our method with respect to classic
tracking-by-detection methods and also other methods that greedily integrate
low-level features.

 <dc:description>  In designing dynamic shared service systems that incentivize customers to opt
for shared rather than exclusive service, the traditional notion of individual
rationality may be insufficient, as a customer's estimated utility could
fluctuate arbitrarily during their time in the shared system, as long as their
realized utility at service completion is not worse than that for exclusive
service. In this work, within a model that explicitly considers the
&quot;inconvenience costs&quot; incurred by customers due to sharing, we introduce the
notion of sequential individual rationality (SIR) that requires that the
disutility of existing customers is nonincreasing as the system state changes
due to new customer arrivals. Next, under SIR, we observe that cost sharing can
also be viewed as benefit sharing, which inspires a natural definition of
sequential fairness (SF) - the total incremental benefit due to a new customer
is shared among existing customers in proportion to the incremental
inconvenience suffered.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of these notions by applying them to a
ridesharing system, where unexpected detours to pick up subsequent passengers
inconvenience the existing passengers. Imposing SIR and SF reveals interesting
and surprising results, including: (a) natural limits on the incremental
detours permissible, (b) exact characterization of &quot;SIR-feasible&quot; routes, which
boast sublinear upper and lower bounds on the fractional detours, (c) exact
characterization of sequentially fair cost sharing schemes, which includes a
strong requirement that passengers must compensate each other for the detour
inconveniences that they cause, and (d) new algorithmic problems related to and
motivated by SIR.

 <dc:description>  Autonomous robots operating in dynamic environments must maintain beliefs
over a hypothesis space that is rich enough to represent the activities of
interest at different scales. This is important both in order to accommodate
the availability of evidence at varying degrees of coarseness, such as when
interpreting and assimilating natural instructions, but also in order to make
subsequent reactive planning more efficient. We present an algorithm that
combines a topology-based trajectory clustering procedure that generates
hierarchically-structured spatial abstractions with a bank of particle filters
at each of these abstraction levels so as to produce probability estimates over
an agent's navigation activity that is kept consistent across the hierarchy. We
study the performance of the proposed method using a synthetic trajectory
dataset in 2D, as well as a dataset taken from AIS-based tracking of ships in
an extended harbour area. We show that, in comparison to a baseline which is a
particle filter that estimates activity without exploiting such structure, our
method achieves a better normalised error in predicting the trajectory as well
as better time to convergence to a true class when compared against ground
truth.

targeting and web search. Our method leverages past user interactions with
items and their attributes to compute low-dimensional embeddings of items.
Specifically, the item metadata is in- jected into the model as side

 <dc:description>  The task of predicting future relationships in a social network, known as
link prediction, has been studied extensively in the literature. Many link
prediction methods have been proposed, ranging from common neighbors to
probabilistic models. Recent work by Yang et al. has highlighted several
challenges in evaluating link prediction accuracy. In dynamic networks where
edges are both added and removed over time, the link prediction problem is more
complex and involves predicting both newly added and newly removed edges. This
results in new challenges in the evaluation of dynamic link prediction methods,
and the recommendations provided by Yang et al. are no longer applicable,
because they do not address edge removal. In this paper, we investigate several
metrics currently used for evaluating accuracies of dynamic link prediction
methods and demonstrate why they can be misleading in many cases. We provide
several recommendations on evaluating dynamic link prediction accuracy,
including separation into two categories of evaluation. Finally we propose a
unified metric to characterize link prediction accuracy effectively using a
single number.

 <dc:title>An Explicit, Coupled-Layer Construction of a High-Rate MSR Code with Low
  Sub-Packetization Level, Small Field Size and All-Node Repair</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an explicit construction for an $((n,k,d=n-1),
(\alpha,\beta))$ regenerating code over a field $\mathbb{F}_Q$ operating at the
Minimum Storage Regeneration (MSR) point. The MSR code can be constructed to
have rate $k/n$ as close to $1$ as desired, sub-packetization given by
$r^{\frac{n}{r}}$, for $r=(n-k)$, field size no larger than $n$ and where all
code symbols can be repaired with the same minimum data download. The
construction modifies a prior construction by Sasidharan et. al. which required
far larger field-size. A building block appearing in the construction is a
scalar MDS code of block length $n$. The code has a simple layered structure
with coupling across layers, that allows both node repair and data recovery to
be carried out by making multiple calls to a decoder for the scalar MDS code.
While this work was carried out independently, there is considerable overlap
with a prior construction by Ye and Barg.
  It is shown here that essentially the same architecture can be employed to
construct MSR codes using vector binary MDS codes as building blocks in place
of scalar MDS codes. The advantage here is that computations can now be carried
out over a field of smaller size potentially even over the binary field as we
demonstrate in an example. Further, we show how the construction can be
extended to handle the case of $d&lt;(n-1)$ under a mild restriction on the choice
of helper nodes.

 <dc:description>  Spark has been established as an attractive platform for big data analysis,
since it manages to hide most of the complexities related to parallelism, fault
tolerance and cluster setting from developers. However, this comes at the
expense of having over 150 configurable parameters, the impact of which cannot
be exhaustively examined due to the exponential amount of their combinations.
The default values allow developers to quickly deploy their applications but
leave the question as to whether performance can be improved open. In this
work, we investigate the impact of the most important of the tunable Spark
parameters on the application performance and guide developers on how to
proceed to changes to the default values. We conduct a series of experiments
with known benchmarks on the MareNostrum petascale supercomputer to test the
performance sensitivity. More importantly, we offer a trial-and-error
methodology for tuning parameters in arbitrary applications based on evidence
from a very small number of experimental runs. We test our methodology in three
case studies, where we manage to achieve speedups of more than 10 times.

 <dc:description>  A sliding k-transmitter in an orthogonal polygon P is a mobile guard that
travels back and forth along an orthogonal line segment s inside P. It can see
a point p in P if the perpendicular from p onto s intersects the boundary of P
at most k times. We show that guarding an orthogonal polygon P with the minimum
number of k-transmitters is NP-hard, for any fixed k&gt;0, even if P is simple and
monotone. Moreover, we give an O(1)-approximation algorithm for this problem.

 <dc:description>  In a two-user broadcast channel where one user has full CSIR and the other
has none, a recent result showed that TDMA is strictly suboptimal and a product
superposition requiring non-coherent signaling achieves DoF gains under many
antenna configurations. This work introduces product superposition in the
domain of coherent signaling with pilots, demonstrates the advantages of
product superposition in low-SNR as well as high-SNR, and establishes DoF gains
in a wider set of receiver antenna configurations. Two classes of decoders,
with and without interference cancellation, are studied. Achievable rates are
established by analysis and illustrated by simulations.

given set $P$ of $n$ points and a set $D$ of $m$ geometric objects both in the
plane, the objective of the Unique Set Cover problem is to select a subset

where a point is covered uniquely if the point is covered by exactly one object

unit squares by applying the mod-one approach of Chan and Hu (Comput. Geom.

 <dc:title>Identifying Depression on Twitter</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nadeem, Moin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Social media has recently emerged as a premier method to disseminate
information online. Through these online networks, tens of millions of
individuals communicate their thoughts, personal experiences, and social
ideals. We therefore explore the potential of social media to predict, even
prior to onset, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in online personas. We employ a
crowdsourced method to compile a list of Twitter users who profess to being
diagnosed with depression. Using up to a year of prior social media postings,
we utilize a Bag of Words approach to quantify each tweet. Lastly, we leverage
several statistical classifiers to provide estimates to the risk of depression.
Our work posits a new methodology for constructing our classifier by treating
social as a text-classification problem, rather than a behavioral one on social
media platforms. By using a corpus of 2.5M tweets, we achieved an 81% accuracy
rate in classification, with a precision score of .86. We believe that this
method may be helpful in developing tools that estimate the risk of an
individual being depressed, can be employed by physicians, concerned
individuals, and healthcare agencies to aid in diagnosis, even possibly
enabling those suffering from depression to be more proactive about recovering
from their mental health.

 <dc:description>  We consider clustering problems where the goal is to determine an optimal
partition of a given point set in Euclidean space in terms of a collection of
affine subspaces. While there is vast literature on heuristics for this kind of
problem, such approaches are known to be susceptible to poor initializations
and getting trapped in bad local optima. We alleviate these issues by
introducing a semidefinite relaxation based on Lasserre's method of moments.
While a similiar approach is known for classical Euclidean clustering problems,
a generalization to our more general subspace scenario is not straightforward,
due to the high symmetry of the objective function that weakens any convex
relaxation. We therefore introduce a new mechanism for symmetry breaking based
on covering the feasible region with polytopes. Additionally, we introduce and
analyze a deterministic rounding heuristic.

 <dc:description>  Matrix sketching is aimed at finding close approximations of a matrix by
factors of much smaller dimensions, which has important applications in
optimization and machine learning. Given a matrix A of size m by n,
state-of-the-art randomized algorithms take O(m * n) time and space to obtain
its low-rank decomposition. Although quite useful, the need to store or
manipulate the entire matrix makes it a computational bottleneck for truly
large and dense inputs. Can we sketch an m-by-n matrix in O(m + n) cost by
accessing only a small fraction of its rows and columns, without knowing
anything about the remaining data? In this paper, we propose the cascaded
bilateral sampling (CABS) framework to solve this problem. We start from
demonstrating how the approximation quality of bilateral matrix sketching
depends on the encoding powers of sampling. In particular, the sampled rows and
columns should correspond to the code-vectors in the ground truth
decompositions. Motivated by this analysis, we propose to first generate a
pilot-sketch using simple random sampling, and then pursue more advanced,
&quot;follow-up&quot; sampling on the pilot-sketch factors seeking maximal encoding
powers. In this cascading process, the rise of approximation quality is shown
to be lower-bounded by the improvement of encoding powers in the follow-up
sampling step, thus theoretically guarantees the algorithmic boosting property.
Computationally, our framework only takes linear time and space, and at the
same time its performance rivals the quality of state-of-the-art algorithms
consuming a quadratic amount of resources. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
data fully demonstrate the potential of our methods in large scale matrix
sketching and related areas.

 <dc:description>  We solve the problem of output feedback stabilization of a class of nonlinear
systems, which may have unstable zero dynamics. We allow for any globally
stabilizing full state feedback control scheme to be used as long as it
satisfies a particular ISS condition. We show semi-global stability of the
origin of the closed-loop system and also the recovery of the performance of an
auxiliary system using a full-order observer. This observer is based on the use
of an extended high-gain observer to provide estimates of the output and its
derivatives plus a signal used by an extended Kalman filter to provide
estimates of the remaining states. Finally, we provide a simulation example
that illustrates the design procedure.

 <dc:title>On the Ubiquity of Web Tracking: Insights from a Billion-Page Web Crawl</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We perform a large-scale analysis of third-party trackers on the World Wide
Web from more than 3.5 billion web pages of the CommonCrawl 2012 corpus. We
extract a dataset containing more than 140 million third-party embeddings in
over 41 million domains. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the
largest web tracking dataset collected so far, and exceeds related studies by
more than an order of magnitude in the number of domains and web pages
analyzed. We perform a large-scale study of online tracking, on three levels:
(1) On a global level, we give a precise figure for the extent of tracking,
give insights into the structure of the `online tracking sphere' and analyse
which trackers are used by how many websites. (2) On a country-specific level,
we analyse which trackers are used by websites in different countries, and
identify the countries in which websites choose significantly different
trackers than in the rest of the world. (3) We answer the question whether the
content of websites influences the choice of trackers they use, leveraging more
than 90 thousand categorized domains. In particular, we analyse whether highly
privacy-critical websites make different choices of trackers than other
websites. Based on the performed analyses, we confirm that trackers are
widespread (as expected), and that a small number of trackers dominates the web
(Google, Facebook and Twitter). In particular, the three tracking domains with
the highest PageRank are all owned by Google. The only exception to this
pattern are a few countries such as China and Russia. Our results suggest that
this dominance is strongly associated with country-specific political factors
such as freedom of the press. We also confirm that websites with highly
privacy-critical content are less likely to contain trackers (60% vs 90% for
other websites), even though the majority of them still do contain trackers.

 <dc:description>  We introduce gvnn, a neural network library in Torch aimed towards bridging
the gap between classic geometric computer vision and deep learning. Inspired
by the recent success of Spatial Transformer Networks, we propose several new
layers which are often used as parametric transformations on the data in
geometric computer vision. These layers can be inserted within a neural network
much in the spirit of the original spatial transformers and allow
backpropagation to enable end-to-end learning of a network involving any domain
knowledge in geometric computer vision. This opens up applications in learning
invariance to 3D geometric transformation for place recognition, end-to-end
visual odometry, depth estimation and unsupervised learning through warping
with a parametric transformation for image reconstruction error.

 <dc:title>Unfolding Convex Polyhedra via Radially Monotone Cut Trees</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>52B10</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A notion of &quot;radially monotone&quot; cut paths is introduced as an effective
choice for finding a non-overlapping edge-unfolding of a convex polyhedron.
These paths have the property that the two sides of the cut avoid overlap
locally as the cut is infinitesimally opened by the curvature at the vertices
along the path. It is shown that a class of planar, triangulated convex domains
always have a radially monotone spanning forest, a forest that can be found by
an essentially greedy algorithm. This algorithm can be mimicked in 3D and
applied to polyhedra inscribed in a sphere. Although the algorithm does not
provably find a radially monotone cut tree, it in fact does find such a tree
with high frequency, and after cutting unfolds without overlap. This
performance of a greedy algorithm leads to the conjecture that spherical
polyhedra always have a radially monotone cut tree and unfold without overlap.

 <dc:description>  Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) is a machine learning technique used
for single class classification and outlier detection. SVDD based K-chart was
first introduced by Sun and Tsung for monitoring multivariate processes when
underlying distribution of process parameters or quality characteristics depart
from Normality. The method first trains a SVDD model on data obtained from
stable or in-control operations of the process to obtain a threshold $R^2$ and
kernel center a. For each new observation, its Kernel distance from the Kernel
center a is calculated. The kernel distance is compared against the threshold
$R^2$ to determine if the observation is within the control limits. The
non-parametric K-chart provides an attractive alternative to the traditional
control charts such as the Hotelling's $T^2$ charts when distribution of the
underlying multivariate data is either non-normal or is unknown. But there are
challenges when K-chart is deployed in practice. The K-chart requires
calculating kernel distance of each new observation but there are no guidelines
on how to interpret the kernel distance plot and infer about shifts in process
mean or changes in process variation. This limits the application of K-charts
in big-data applications such as equipment health monitoring, where
observations are generated at a very high frequency. In this scenario, the
analyst using the K-chart is inundated with kernel distance results at a very
high frequency, generally without any recourse for detecting presence of any
assignable causes of variation. We propose a new SVDD based control chart,
called as $K_T$ chart, which addresses challenges encountered when using
K-chart for big-data applications. The $K_T$ charts can be used to
simultaneously track process variation and central tendency. We illustrate the
successful use of $K_T$ chart using the Tennessee Eastman process data.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a tensor multiplication based smoothing algorithm that
follows a two step denoising method. Unlike other traditional averaging
approaches, our approach uses an element based normal voting tensor to compute
smooth surfaces. By introducing a binary optimization on the proposed tensor
together with a local binary neighborhood concept, our algorithm better retains
sharp features and produces smoother umbilical regions than previous
approaches. On top of that, we provide a stochastic analysis on the different
kinds of noise based on the average edge length. The quantitative and visual
results demonstrate the performance our method is better compared to state of
the art smoothing approaches.

 <dc:description>  Large-scale annotated datasets allow AI systems to learn from and build upon
the knowledge of the crowd. Many crowdsourcing techniques have been developed
for collecting image annotations. These techniques often implicitly rely on the
fact that a new input image takes a negligible amount of time to perceive. In
contrast, we investigate and determine the most cost-effective way of obtaining
high-quality multi-label annotations for temporal data such as videos. Watching
even a short 30-second video clip requires a significant time investment from a
crowd worker; thus, requesting multiple annotations following a single viewing
is an important cost-saving strategy. But how many questions should we ask per
video? We conclude that the optimal strategy is to ask as many questions as
possible in a HIT (up to 52 binary questions after watching a 30-second video
clip in our experiments). We demonstrate that while workers may not correctly
answer all questions, the cost-benefit analysis nevertheless favors consensus
from multiple such cheap-yet-imperfect iterations over more complex
alternatives. When compared with a one-question-per-video baseline, our method
is able to achieve a 10% improvement in recall 76.7% ours versus 66.7%
baseline) at comparable precision (83.8% ours versus 83.0% baseline) in about
half the annotation time (3.8 minutes ours compared to 7.1 minutes baseline).
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by collecting multi-label
annotations of 157 human activities on 1,815 videos.

 <dc:description>  Clustering with most objective functions is NP-Hard, even to approximate well
in the worst case. Recently, there has been work on exploring different notions
of stability which lend structure to the problem. The notion of stability,
$\alpha$-perturbation resilience, that we study in this paper was originally
introduced by Bilu et al.~\cite{Bilu10}. The works of Awasthi et
al~\cite{Awasthi12} and Balcan et al.~\cite{Balcan12} provide a polynomial time
algorithm for $3$-stable and $(1+\sqrt{2})$-stable instances respectively. This
paper provides a polynomial time algorithm for $2$-stable instances, improving
on and answering an open question in ~\cite{Balcan12}.

 <dc:title>Symbols of a cosmic order</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The world runs on communicated sequences of symbols, e.g. numerals. Examining
both engineered and natural communications networks reveals an unsuspected
order that depends on contact with an unpredictable entity. This order has
three roots. The first is a proof within quantum theory that no evidence can
ever determine its explanation, so that an agent choosing an explanation must
do so unpredictably. The second root is the showing that clocks that step
computers do not &quot;tell time&quot; but serve as self-adjusting symbol-handling agents
that regulate &quot;logically synchronized&quot; motion in response to unpredictable
disturbances. Such a clock-agent has a certain independence as well as the
capacity to communicate via unpredictable symbols with other clock-agents and
to adjust its own tick rate in response to that communication. The third root
is the noticing of unpredictable symbol exchange in natural systems, including
the transmission of symbols found in molecular biology. We introduce a
symbol-handling agent as a role played in some cases by a person, for example a
physicist who chooses an explanation of given experimental outcomes, and in
other cases by some other biological entity, and in still other cases by an
inanimate device, such as a computer-based detector used in physical
measurements. While we forbear to try to explain the propensity of agents at
all levels from cells to civilizations to form and operate networks of
logically synchronized symbol-handling agents, we point to this propensity as
an overlooked cosmic order, an order structured by the unpredictability ensuing
from the proof. Appreciating the cosmic order leads to a conception of agency
that replaces volition by unpredictability and re-conceives the notion of
objectivity in a way that makes a place for agency in the world as described by
physics. Some specific implications for physics are outlined.

 <dc:description>  Planning balanced and collision-free motion for humanoid robots is
non-trivial, especially when they are operated in complex environments, such as
reaching targets behind obstacles or through narrow passages. We propose a
method that allows us to apply existing sampling--based algorithms to plan
trajectories for humanoids by utilizing a customized state space
representation, biased sampling strategies, and a steering function based on a
robust inverse kinematics solver. Our approach requires no prior offline
computation, thus one can easily transfer the work to new robot platforms. We
tested the proposed method solving practical reaching tasks on a 38
degrees-of-freedom humanoid robot, NASA Valkyrie, showing that our method is
able to generate valid motion plans that can be executed on advanced full-size
humanoid robots. We also present a benchmark between different motion planning
algorithms evaluated on a variety of reaching motion problems. This allows us
to find suitable algorithms for solving humanoid motion planning problems, and

 <dc:description>  We present a novel approach for collision-free global navigation for
continuous-time multi-agent systems with general linear dynamics. Our approach
is general and can be used to perform collision-free navigation in 2D and 3D
workspaces with narrow passages and crowded regions. As part of
pre-computation, we compute multiple bridges in the narrow or tight regions in
the workspace using kinodynamic RRT algorithms. Our bridge has certain
geometric characteristics, that en- able us to calculate a collision-free
trajectory for each agent using simple interpolation at runtime. Moreover, we
combine interpolated bridge trajectories with local multi-agent navigation
algorithms to compute global collision-free paths for each agent. The overall
approach combines the performance benefits of coupled multi-agent algorithms
with the pre- computed trajectories of the bridges to handle challenging
scenarios. In practice, our approach can handle tens to hundreds of agents in
real-time on a single CPU core in 2D and 3D workspaces.

 <dc:description>  The function of protein, RNA, and DNA is modulated by fast, dynamic exchanges
between three-dimensional conformations. Conformational sampling of
biomolecules with exact and nullspace inverse kinematics, using rotatable bonds
as revolute joints and non-covalent interactions as holonomic constraints, can
accurately characterize these native ensembles. However, sampling biomolecules
remains challenging owing to their ultra-high dimensional configuration spaces,
and the requirement to avoid (self-) collisions, which results in low
acceptance rates.
  Here, we present two novel mechanisms to overcome these limitations. First,
we introduced temporary constraints between near-colliding links. The resulting
constraint varieties instantaneously redirect the search for collision-free
conformations, and couple motions between distant parts of the linkage. Second,
we adapted a randomized Poisson-disk motion planner, which prevents local
oversampling and widens the search, to ultra-high dimensions. We evaluated our
algorithm on several model systems. Our contributions apply to general
high-dimensional motion planning problems in static and dynamic environments
with obstacles.

  In the case with complex Gaussian random measurement matrices, a

 <dc:title>Automatic Construction of Statechart-Based Anomaly Detection Models for
  Multi-Threaded Industrial Control Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kleinmann, Amit</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Traffic of Industrial Control System (ICS) between the Human Machine
Interface (HMI) and the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) is known to be
highly periodic. However, it is sometimes multiplexed, due to asynchronous
scheduling. Modeling the network traffic patterns of multiplexed ICS streams
using Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for anomaly detection typically
produces a very large DFA, and a high false-alarm rate. We introduce a new
modeling approach that addresses this gap. Our Statechart DFA modeling includes
multiple DFAs, one per cyclic pattern, together with a DFA-selector that
de-multiplexes the incoming traffic into sub-channels and sends them to their
respective DFAs. We demonstrate how to automatically construct the Statechart
from a captured traffic stream. Our unsupervised learning algorithm builds a
Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from the stream. Next it splits the symbols
into sets, one per multiplexed cycle, based on symbol frequencies and node
degrees in the DTMC graph. Then it creates a sub-graph for each cycle, and
extracts Euler cycles for each sub-graph. The final Statechart is comprised of
one DFA per Euler cycle. The algorithms allow for non-unique symbols, that
appear in more than one cycle, and also for symbols that appear more than once
in a cycle. We evaluated our solution on traces from a production ICS using the
Siemens S7-0x72 protocol. We also stress-tested our algorithms on a collection
of synthetically-generated traces that simulated multiplexed ICS traces with
varying levels of symbol uniqueness and time overlap. The algorithms were able
to split the symbols into sets with 99.6% accuracy. The resulting Statechart
modeled the traces with a low median false-alarm rate of 0.483%. In all but the
most extreme scenarios the Statechart model drastically reduced both the
false-alarm rate and the learned model size in compare to a naive single-DFA
model

 <dc:description>  A binary matrix is a matrix with entries from the set $\{0,1\}$. We say that
a binary matrix $A$ contains a binary matrix $S$ if $S$ can be obtained from
$A$ by removal of some rows, some columns, and changing some $1$-entries to
$0$-entries. If $A$ does not contain $S$, we say that $A$ avoids $S$. A
$k$-permutation matrix $P$ is a binary $k \times k$ matrix with exactly one
$1$-entry in every row and one $1$-entry in every column.
  The F\&quot;uredi-Hajnal conjecture, proved by Marcus and Tardos, states that for
every permutation matrix $P$, there is a constant $c_P$ such that for every $n
\in \mathbb{N}$, every $n \times n$ binary matrix $A$ with at least $c_P n$
$1$-entries contains $P$.
  We show that $c_P \le 2^{O(k^{2/3}\log^{7/3}k / (\log\log k)^{1/3})}$
asymptotically almost surely for a random $k$-permutation matrix $P$. We also
show that $c_P \le 2^{(4+o(1))k}$ for every $k$-permutation matrix $P$,
improving the constant in the exponent of a recent upper bound on $c_P$ by Fox.
  We also consider a higher-dimensional generalization of the Stanley-Wilf
conjecture about the number of $d$-dimensional $n$-permutation matrices
avoiding a fixed $d$-dimensional $k$-permutation matrix, and prove almost
matching upper and lower bounds of the form $(2^k)^{O(n)} \cdot
(n!)^{d-1-1/(d-1)}$ and $n^{-O(k)} k^{\Omega(n)} \cdot (n!)^{d-1-1/(d-1)}$,
respectively.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the concept of Machine Learning (ML) is introduced to the
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access-based (OFDMA-based) scheduler.
Similar to the impact of the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) on the scheduler
in the Long Term Evolution (LTE), ML is utilized to provide the scheduler with
pertinent information about the User Equipment (UE) traffic patterns, demands,
Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, instantaneous user throughput and other
network conditions. An adaptive ML-based framework is proposed in order to
optimize the LTE scheduler operation. The proposed technique targets multiple
objective scheduling strategies. The weights of the different objectives are
adjusted to optimize the resources allocation per transmission based on the UEs
demand pattern. In addition, it overcomes the trade-off problem of the
traditional scheduling methods. The technique can be used as a generic
framework with any scheduling strategy. In this paper, Genetic Algorithm-based
(GA-based) multi- objective scheduler is considered to illustrate the
efficiency of the proposed adaptive scheduling solution. Results show that
using the combination of clustering and classification algorithms along with
the GA optimizes the GA scheduler functionality and makes use of the ML process
to form a closed loop scheduling mechanism.

 <dc:title>A Hierarchy of Lower Bounds for Sublinear Additive Spanners</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Spanners, emulators, and approximate distance oracles can be viewed as lossy
compression schemes that represent an unweighted graph metric in small space,
say $\tilde{O}(n^{1+\delta})$ bits. There is an inherent tradeoff between the
sparsity parameter $\delta$ and the stretch function $f$ of the compression
scheme, but the qualitative nature of this tradeoff has remained a persistent
open problem.
  In this paper we show that the recent additive spanner lower bound of Abboud
and Bodwin is just the first step in a hierarchy of lower bounds that fully
characterize the asymptotic behavior of the optimal stretch function $f$ as a
function of $\delta \in (0,1/3)$. Specifically, for any integer $k\ge 2$, any
compression scheme with size $O(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^k-1} - \epsilon})$ has a
sublinear additive stretch function $f$: $$f(d) = d +
\Omega(d^{1-\frac{1}{k}}).$$ This lower bound matches Thorup and Zwick's (2006)
construction of sublinear additive emulators. It also shows that Elkin and
Peleg's $(1+\epsilon,\beta)$-spanners have an essentially optimal tradeoff
between $\delta,\epsilon,$ and $\beta$, and that the sublinear additive
spanners of Pettie (2009) and Chechik (2013) are not too far from optimal.
  To complement these lower bounds we present a new construction of
$(1+\epsilon, O(k/\epsilon)^{k-1})$-spanners with size $O((k/\epsilon)^{h_k}
kn^{1+\frac{1}{2^{k+1}-1}})$, where $h_k &lt; 3/4$. This size bound improves on
the spanners of Elkin and Peleg (2004), Thorup and Zwick (2006), and Pettie
(2009). According to our lower bounds neither the size nor stretch function can
be substantially improved.

 <dc:title>Cascading Node Failure with Continuous States in Random Geometric

 <dc:description>  The increasing complexity and interdependency of today's networks highlight
the importance of studying network robustness to failure and attacks. Many
large-scale networks are prone to cascading effects where a limited number of
initial failures (due to attacks, natural hazards or resource depletion)
propagate through a dependent mechanism, ultimately leading to a global failure
scenario where a substantial fraction of the network loses its functionality.
These cascading failure scenarios often take place in networks which are
embedded in space and constrained by geometry. Building on previous results on
cascading failure in random geometric networks, we introduce and analyze a
continuous cascading failure model where a node has an initial
continuously-valued state, and fails if the aggregate state of its neighbors
fall below a threshold. Within this model, we derive analytical conditions for
the occurrence and non-occurrence of cascading node failure, respectively.

 <dc:title>Verso folio: Diversified Ranking for Large Graphs with Context-Aware
  Considerations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tsatsanifos, George</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>H.3.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work is pertaining to the diversified ranking of web-resources and
interconnected documents that rely on a network-like structure, e.g. web-pages.
A practical example of this would be a query for the k most relevant web-pages
that are also in the same time as dissimilar with each other as possible.
Relevance and dissimilarity are quantified using an aggregation of network
distance and context similarity. For example, for a specific configuration of
the problem, we might be interested in web-pages that are similar with the
query in terms of their textual description but distant from each other in
terms of the web-graph, e.g. many clicks away. In retrospect, a dearth of work
can be found in the literature addressing this problem taking the network
structure formed by the document links into consideration.
  In this work, we propose a hill-climbing approach that is seeded with a
document collection which is generated using greedy heuristics to diversify
initially. More importantly, we tackle the problem in the context of web-pages
where there is an underlying network structure connecting the available
documents and resources. This is a significant difference to the majority of
works that tackle the problem in terms of either content definitions, or the
graph structure of the data, but never addressing both aspects simultaneously.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first effort that can be found
to combine both aspects of this important problem in an elegant fashion by also
allowing a great degree of flexibility on how to configure the trade-offs of
(i) document relevance over result-items' dissimilarity, and (ii) network
distance over content relevance or dissimilarity. Last but not least, we
present an extensive evaluation of our methods that demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency thereof.

energy harvesting transmitter. To overcome the non-convexity of the problem, we
propose a C2-diffeomorphic transformation and provide the necessary and
sufficient condition for the transformed problem to a standard convex
optimization problem. Based on this condition, a simple choice of the
transformation is determined which allows an analytically tractable solution of
the original non-convex problem to be easily obtained once the transformed
convex problem is solved. We further study the structure of the optimal
transmission policy in a special case and find it to follow a
weighted-directional-water-filling structure. In particular, the optimal policy
tends to allocate more power in earlier time slots and less power in later time
slots. Our analytical insight is verified by simulation results.

 <dc:description>  We present Tweet2Vec, a novel method for generating general-purpose vector
representation of tweets. The model learns tweet embeddings using
character-level CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder. We trained our model on 3 million,
randomly selected English-language tweets. The model was evaluated using two
methods: tweet semantic similarity and tweet sentiment categorization,
outperforming the previous state-of-the-art in both tasks. The evaluations
demonstrate the power of the tweet embeddings generated by our model for
various tweet categorization tasks. The vector representations generated by our
model are generic, and hence can be applied to a variety of tasks. Though the
model presented in this paper is trained on English-language tweets, the method
presented can be used to learn tweet embeddings for different languages.

 <dc:description>  Mobile apps are one of the building blocks of the mobile digital economy. A
differentiating feature of mobile apps to traditional enterprise software is
online reviews, which are available on app marketplaces and represent a
valuable source of consumer feedback on the app. We create a supervised topic
modeling approach for app developers to use mobile reviews as useful sources of
quality and customer feedback, thereby complementing traditional software
testing. The approach is based on a constrained matrix factorization that
leverages the relationship between term frequency and a given response variable
in addition to co-occurrences between terms to recover topics that are both
predictive of consumer sentiment and useful for understanding the underlying
textual themes. The factorization is combined with ordinal regression to
provide guidance from online reviews on a single app's performance as well as
systematically compare different apps over time for benchmarking of features
and consumer sentiment. We apply our approach using a dataset of over 100,000
mobile reviews over several years for three of the most popular online travel
agent apps from the iTunes and Google Play marketplaces.

 <dc:description>  We prove a lower bound on the information leakage of any classical protocol
computing the equality function in the simultaneous message passing (SMP)
model. Our bound is valid in the finite length regime and is strong enough to
demonstrate a quantum advantage in terms of information leakage for practical
quantum protocols. We prove our bound by obtaining an improved finite size
version of the communication bound due to Babai and Kimmel, relating randomized
communication to deterministic communication in the SMP model. We then relate
information leakage to randomized communication through a series of reductions.
We first provide alternative characterizations for information leakage,
allowing us to link it to average length communication while allowing for
shared randomness (pairwise, with the referee). A Markov inequality links this
with bounded length communication, and a Newman type argument allows us to go
from shared to private randomness. The only reduction in which we incur more
than a logarithmic additive factor is in the Markov inequality; in particular,
our compression method is essentially tight for the SMP model with average
length communication.

 <dc:description>  Feature engineering remains a major bottleneck when creating predictive
systems from electronic medical records. At present, an important missing
element is detecting predictive regular clinical motifs from irregular episodic
records. We present Deepr (short for Deep record), a new end-to-end deep
learning system that learns to extract features from medical records and
predicts future risk automatically. Deepr transforms a record into a sequence
of discrete elements separated by coded time gaps and hospital transfers. On
top of the sequence is a convolutional neural net that detects and combines
predictive local clinical motifs to stratify the risk. Deepr permits
transparent inspection and visualization of its inner working. We validate
Deepr on hospital data to predict unplanned readmission after discharge. Deepr
achieves superior accuracy compared to traditional techniques, detects
meaningful clinical motifs, and uncovers the underlying structure of the
disease and intervention space.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of Salient Object Subitizing, i.e. predicting the
existence and the number of salient objects in an image using holistic cues.
This task is inspired by the ability of people to quickly and accurately
identify the number of items within the subitizing range (1-4). To this end, we
present a salient object subitizing image dataset of about 14K everyday images
which are annotated using an online crowdsourcing marketplace. We show that
using an end-to-end trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, we
achieve prediction accuracy comparable to human performance in identifying
images with zero or one salient object. For images with multiple salient
objects, our model also provides significantly better than chance performance
without requiring any localization process. Moreover, we propose a method to
improve the training of the CNN subitizing model by leveraging synthetic
images. In experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy and generalizability of our
CNN subitizing model and its applications in salient object detection and image
retrieval.

 <dc:description>  Nearest neighbor has been one of the simplest and most appealing
non-parametric approaches in machine learning, pattern recognition, computer
vision, etc. Empirical studies show the resistance of k-nearest neighbor to
noise, yet the theoretical understanding is not clear. This work presents the
consistency analysis on exact and approximate nearest neighbor in the random
noise setting. Our theoretical studies show that k-nearest neighbor, in the
noise setting, gets the same consistent rate as that in the noise-free setting,
which verifies the robustness of k-nearest neighbor to random noise. The
nearest neighbor (1-NN), however, is proven to be biased by random noise. For
approximate $k$-nearest neighbor, we first generalize the Johnson-Lindenstrauss
lemma to infinite set, and based on this result, we show that the approximate
$k$-nearest neighbor is also robust to random noise as that of the exact
k-nearest neighbor, and achieves faster convergence rate yet with a tradeoff
between consistency and reduced dimension. Specifically, approximate
$k$-nearest neighbor with sharp dimensional reduction tends to cause large
deviation from the Bayes risk.

 <dc:description>  Comparing with traditional fixed formation for a group of dynamical systems,
time-varying formation can produce the following benefits: i) covering the
greater part of complex environments; ii) collision avoidance. This paper
studies the time-varying formation tracking for multiple manipulator systems
(MMSs) under fixed and switching directed graphs with a dynamic leader, whose
acceleration cannot change too fast. An explicit mathematical formulation of
time-varying formation is developed based on the related practical
applications. A class of extended inverse dynamics control algorithms combining
with distributed sliding-mode estimators are developed to address the
aforementioned problem. By invoking finite-time stability arguments, several
novel criteria (including sufficient criteria, necessary and sufficient
criteria) for global finite-time stability of MMSs are established. Finally,
numerical experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness of the
theoretical results.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we look into the issue of intra-cell uplink (UL) pilot
orthogonalization and schemes for mitigating the inter-cell pilot contamination
with a realistic massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system model. First, we show how to
align the power-delay profiles (PDP) of different users served by one BS so
that the pilots sent within one common OFDM symbol are orthogonal. From the
derived aligning rule, we see much more users can be sounded in the same OFDM
symbol as their channels are sparse in time. Second, in the case of massive
MIMO, we show how PDP alignment can help to alleviate the pilot contamination
due to inter-cell interference. We demonstrate that, by utilizing the fact that
different paths in time are associated with different angles of arrival (AoA),
the pilot contamination can be significantly reduced through aligning the PDPs
of the users served by different BSs appropriately. Computer simulations
further convince us PDP aligning can serve as the new baseline design
philosophy for the UL pilots in massive MIMO.

 <dc:description>  Semantic image inpainting is a challenging task where large missing regions
have to be filled based on the available visual data. Existing methods which
extract information from only a single image generally produce unsatisfactory
results due to the lack of high level context. In this paper, we propose a
novel method for semantic image inpainting, which generates the missing content
by conditioning on the available data. Given a trained generative model, we
search for the closest encoding of the corrupted image in the latent image
manifold using our context and prior losses. This encoding is then passed
through the generative model to infer the missing content. In our method,
inference is possible irrespective of how the missing content is structured,
while the state-of-the-art learning based method requires specific information
about the holes in the training phase. Experiments on three datasets show that
our method successfully predicts information in large missing regions and
achieves pixel-level photorealism, significantly outperforming the
state-of-the-art methods.

leader for multiple heterogeneous manipulators (MHMs), containing redundant
manipulators and nonredundant ones. Different from the traditional coordinated
control, distributed controller-estimator algorithms (DCEA), which consist of
local algorithms and networked algorithms, are developed for MHMs with
parametric uncertainties and input disturbances. By invoking differential
inclusions, nonsmooth analysis, and input-to-state stability, some conditions
(including sufficient conditions, necessary and sufficient conditions) on the
asymptotic stability of the task-space tracking errors and the subtask errors
are developed. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the

 <dc:description>  In this paper, an uplink scheduling policy problem to minimize the network
latency, defined as the air-time to serve all of users with a
quality-of-service (QoS), under an energy constraint is considered in a
training-based large-scale antenna systems (LSAS) employing a simple linear
receiver. An optimal algorithm providing the exact latency-optimal uplink
scheduling policy is proposed with a polynomial-time complexity. Via numerical
simulations, it is shown that the proposed scheduling policy can provide
several times lower network latency over the conventional ones in realistic
environments. In addition, the proposed scheduling policy and its network
latency are analyzed asymptotically to provide better insights on the system
behavior. Four operating regimes are classified according to the average
received signal quality, $\rho$, and the number of BS antennas, $M$. It turns
out that orthogonal pilots are optimal only in the regime $\rho\gg1$ and $ M\ll
\log^2\rho$. In other regimes ($\rho\ll 1$ or $ M\gg \log^2\rho$), it turns out
that non-orthogonal pilots become optimal. More rigorously, the use of
non-orthogonal pilots can reduce the network latency by a factor of $\Theta(M)$
when $\rho\ll 1$ or by a factor of $\Theta(\sqrt{M}/\log M)$ when $\rho\gg 1$
and $M\gg \log\rho$, which would be a critical guideline for designing 5G
future cellular systems.

 <dc:title>Flexible Pilot Contamination Mitigation with Doppler PSD Alignment</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Luo, Xiliang</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Xiaoyu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Pilot contamination in the uplink (UL) can severely degrade the channel
estimation quality at the base station (BS) in a massive multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) system. Thus, it is critical to explore all possible
avenues to enable more orthogonal resources for the users to transmit
non-interfering UL pilots. In conventional designs, pilot orthogonality
typically assumes constant channel gains over time, which limits the amount of
orthogonal resources in the case of time-selective channels. To circumvent this
constraint, in this paper, we show how to enable orthogonal multiplexing of
pilots in the case of Doppler fading by aligning the power spectrum densities
(PSD) of different users. From the derived PSD aligning rules, we can see
multiple users can be sounded simultaneously without creating/suffering pilot
contamination even when these users are experiencing time-varying channels.
Furthermore, we provide analytical formulas characterizing the channel
estimation mean square error (MSE) performance. Computer simulations further
confirm us the PSD alignment can serve as one important decontamination
mechanism for the UL pilots in massive MIMO.

 <dc:title>Low-Congestion Shortcuts without Embedding</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Distributed optimization algorithms are frequently faced with solving
sub-problems on disjoint connected parts of a network. Unfortunately, the
diameter of these parts can be significantly larger than the diameter of the
underlying network, leading to slow running times. Recent work by [Ghaffari and
Hauepler; SODA'16] showed that this phenomenon can be seen as the broad
underlying reason for the pervasive $\Omega(\sqrt{n} + D)$ lower bounds that
apply to most optimization problems in the CONGEST model. On the positive side,
this work also introduced low-congestion shortcuts as an elegant solution to
circumvent this problem in certain topologies of interest. Particularly, they
showed that there exist good shortcuts for any planar network and more
generally any bounded genus network. This directly leads to fast $O(D
\log^{O(1)} n)$ distributed algorithms for MST and Min-Cut approximation, given
that one can efficiently construct these shortcuts in a distributed manner.
  Unfortunately, the shortcut construction of [Ghaffari and Hauepler; SODA'16]
relies heavily on having access to a genus embedding of the network. Computing
such an embedding distributedly, however, is a hard problem - even for planar
networks. No distributed embedding algorithm for bounded genus graphs is in
sight.
  In this work, we side-step this problem by defining a restricted and more
structured form of shortcuts and giving a novel construction algorithm which
efficiently finds a shortcut which is, up to a logarithmic factor, as good as
the best shortcut that exists for a given network. This new construction
algorithm directly leads to an $O(D \log^{O(1)} n)$-round algorithm for solving
optimization problems like MST for any topology for which good restricted
shortcuts exist - without the need to compute any embedding. This includes the
first efficient algorithm for bounded genus graphs.

 <dc:description>  Effective SLAM using a single monocular camera is highly preferred due to its
simplicity. However, when compared to trajectory planning methods using
depth-based SLAM, Monocular SLAM in loop does need additional considerations.
One main reason being that for the optimization, in the form of Bundle
Adjustment (BA), to be robust, the SLAM system needs to scan the area for a
reasonable duration. Most monocular SLAM systems do not tolerate large camera
rotations between successive views and tend to breakdown. Other reasons for
Monocular SLAM failure include ambiguities in decomposition of the Essential
Matrix, feature-sparse scenes and more layers of non linear optimization apart
from BA. This paper presents a novel formulation based on Reinforcement
Learning (RL) that generates fail safe trajectories wherein the SLAM generated
outputs (scene structure and camera motion) do not deviate largely from their
true values. Quintessentially, the RL framework successfully learns the
otherwise complex relation between motor actions and perceptual inputs that
result in trajectories that do not cause failure of SLAM, which are almost
intractable to capture in an obvious mathematical formulation. We show
systematically in simulations how the quality of the SLAM map and trajectory
dramatically improves when trajectories are computed by using RL.

 <dc:description>  Also recently, exciting strides forward have been made in the area of image
restoration, particularly for image denoising and single image
super-resolution. Deep learning techniques contributed to this significantly.
The top methods differ in their formulations and assumptions, so even if their
average performance may be similar, some work better on certain image types and
image regions than others. This complementarity motivated us to propose a novel
3D convolutional fusion (3DCF) method. Unlike other methods adapted to
different tasks, our method uses the exact same convolutional network
architecture to address both image denois- ing and single image
super-resolution. As a result, our 3DCF method achieves substantial
improvements (0.1dB-0.4dB PSNR) over the state-of-the-art methods that it
fuses, and this on standard benchmarks for both tasks. At the same time, the
method still is computationally efficient.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a computational model of the processing of dynamic

complete system is introduced that allows autonomous robots to produce and
interpret dynamic spatial phrases (in English) given an environment of moving
objects. The model unites two separate research strands: computational
cognitive semantics and on commonsense spatial representation and reasoning.
The model for the first time demonstrates an integration of these different
strands.

 <dc:description>  We propose generalizations of a number of standard network models, including
the classic random graph, the configuration model, and the stochastic block
model, to the case of time-varying networks. We assume that the presence and
absence of edges are governed by continuous-time Markov processes with rate
parameters that can depend on properties of the nodes. In addition to computing
equilibrium properties of these models, we demonstrate their use in data
analysis and statistical inference, giving efficient algorithms for fitting
them to observed network data. This allows us, for instance, to estimate the
time constants of network evolution or infer community structure from temporal
network data using cues embedded both in the probabilities over time that node
pairs are connected by edges and in the characteristic dynamics of edge
appearance and disappearance. We illustrate our methods with a selection of
applications, both to computer-generated test networks and real-world examples.

 <dc:description>  The heuristic identification of peaks from noisy complex spectra often leads
to misunderstanding of the physical and chemical properties of matter. In this
paper, we propose a framework based on Bayesian inference, which enables us to
separate multipeak spectra into single peaks statistically and consists of two
steps. The first step is estimating both the noise variance and the number of
peaks as hyperparameters based on Bayes free energy, which generally is not
analytically tractable. The second step is fitting the parameters of each peak
function to the given spectrum by calculating the posterior density, which has
a problem of local minima and saddles since multipeak models are nonlinear and
hierarchical. Our framework enables the escape from local minima or saddles by
using the exchange Monte Carlo method and calculates Bayes free energy via the
multiple histogram method. We discuss a simulation demonstrating how efficient
our framework is and show that estimating both the noise variance and the
number of peaks prevents overfitting, overpenalizing, and misunderstanding the
precision of parameter estimation.

 <dc:description>  Most application development happens in the context of complex APIs;
reference documentation for APIs has grown tremendously in variety, complexity,
and volume, and can be difficult to navigate. There is a growing need to
develop well-organized ways to access the knowledge latent in the
documentation; several research efforts deal with the organization (ontology)
of API-related knowledge. Extensive knowledge-engineering work, supported by a
rigorous qualitative analysis, by Maalej &amp; Robillard [3] has identified a
useful taxonomy of API knowledge. Based on this taxonomy, we introduce a domain
independent technique to extract the knowledge types from the given API
reference documentation. Our system, OntoCat, introduces total nine different
features and their semantic and statistical combinations to classify the
different knowledge types. We tested OntoCat on python API reference
documentation. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of the system
and opens the scope of probably related research areas (i.e., user behavior,
documentation quality, etc.).

 <dc:description>  The interpretation and analysis of the wireless capsule endoscopy recording
is a complex task which requires sophisticated computer aided decision (CAD)
systems in order to help physicians with the video screening and, finally, with
the diagnosis. Most of the CAD systems in the capsule endoscopy share a common
system design, but use very different image and video representations. As a
result, each time a new clinical application of WCE appears, new CAD system has
to be designed from scratch. This characteristic makes the design of new CAD
systems a very time consuming. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a system
for small intestine motility characterization, based on Deep Convolutional
Neural Networks, which avoids the laborious step of designing specific features
for individual motility events. Experimental results show the superiority of
the learned features over alternative classifiers constructed by using state of
the art hand-crafted features. In particular, it reaches a mean classification
accuracy of 96% for six intestinal motility events, outperforming the other
classifiers by a large margin (a 14% relative performance increase).

 <dc:description>  Given a set $U$ of users and a set of items $I$, a dataset of recommendations
can be viewed as a sparse rectangular matrix $A$ of size $|U|\times |I|$ such
that $a_{u,i}$ contains the rating the user $u$ assigns to item $i$,
$a_{u,i}=?$ if the user $u$ has not rated the item $i$. The goal of a
recommender system is to predict replacements to the missing observations $?$
in $A$ in order to make personalized recommendations meeting the user's tastes.
A promising approach is the one based on the low-rank nonnegative matrix
factorization of $A$ where items and users are represented in terms of a few
vectors. These vector can be used for estimating the missing evaluations and to
produce new recommendations. In this paper we propose an algorithm based on the
nonnegative matrix Factorization approach for predicting the missing entries.
Numerical test have been performed to estimate the accuracy in predicting the
missing entries and in the recommendations provided and we have compared our
technique with others in the literature. We have tested the algorithm on the
MovieLens databases containing ratings of users on movies.

explicitly considered learning the constraints of the motion and ways to cope
with unknown environment. In this paper, we consider learning the null space

dimensionality of the constraints. Our evaluations have demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed approach on problems of differing dimensionality,

 <dc:description>  In domain generalization, the knowledge learnt from one or multiple source
domains is transferred to an unseen target domain. In this work, we propose a
novel domain generalization approach for fine-grained scene recognition. We
first propose a semantic scene descriptor that jointly captures the subtle
differences between fine-grained scenes, while being robust to varying object
configurations across domains. We model the occurrence patterns of objects in
scenes, capturing the informativeness and discriminability of each object for
each scene. We then transform such occurrences into scene probabilities for
each scene image. Second, we argue that scene images belong to hidden semantic
topics that can be discovered by clustering our semantic descriptors. To
evaluate the proposed method, we propose a new fine-grained scene dataset in
cross-domain settings. Extensive experiments on the proposed dataset and three
benchmark scene datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for
fine-grained scene transfer, where we outperform state-of-the-art scene
recognition and domain generalization methods.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper discusses grounded acquisition experiments of increasing
complexity. Humanoid robots acquire English spatial lexicons from robot tutors.
We identify how various spatial language systems, such as projective, absolute
and proximal can be learned. The proposed learning mechanisms do not rely on
direct meaning transfer or direct access to world models of interlocutors.
Finally, we show how multiple systems can be acquired at the same time.

 <dc:title>Unrelated Machine Scheduling of Jobs with Uniform Smith Ratios</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the classic problem of scheduling jobs on unrelated machines so
as to minimize the weighted sum of completion times. Recently, for a small
constant $\varepsilon &gt;0 $, Bansal et al. gave a
$(3/2-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm improving upon the natural barrier
of $3/2$ which follows from independent randomized rounding. In simplified
terms, their result is obtained by an enhancement of independent randomized
rounding via strong negative correlation properties.
  In this work, we take a different approach and propose to use the same
elegant rounding scheme for the weighted completion time objective as devised
by Shmoys and Tardos for optimizing a linear function subject to makespan
constraints. Our main result is a $1.21$-approximation algorithm for the
natural special case where the weight of a job is proportional to its
processing time (specifically, all jobs have the same Smith ratio), which
expresses the notion that each unit of work has the same weight. In addition,
as a direct consequence of the rounding, our algorithm also achieves a
bi-criteria $2$-approximation for the makespan objective. Our technical
contribution is a tight analysis of the expected cost of the solution compared
to the one given by the Configuration-LP relaxation - we reduce this task to
that of understanding certain worst-case instances which are simple to analyze.

 <dc:description>  Shearlets are a relatively new directional multi-scale framework for signal
analysis, which have been shown effective to enhance signal discontinuities
such as edges and corners at multiple scales. In this work we address the
problem of detecting and describing blob-like features in the shearlets
framework. We derive a measure which is very effective for blob detection and
closely related to the Laplacian of Gaussian. We demonstrate the measure
satisfies the perfect scale invariance property in the continuous case. In the
discrete setting, we derive algorithms for blob detection and keypoint
description. Finally, we provide qualitative justifications of our findings as
well as a quantitative evaluation on benchmark data. We also report an
experimental evidence that our method is very suitable to deal with compressed
and noisy images, thanks to the sparsity property of shearlets.

 <dc:description>  In crowd behavior understanding, a model of crowd behavior need to be trained
using the information extracted from video sequences. Since there is no
ground-truth available in crowd datasets except the crowd behavior labels, most
of the methods proposed so far are just based on low-level visual features.
However, there is a huge semantic gap between low-level motion/appearance
features and high-level concept of crowd behaviors. In this paper we propose an
attribute-based strategy to alleviate this problem. While similar strategies
have been recently adopted for object and action recognition, as far as we
know, we are the first showing that the crowd emotions can be used as
attributes for crowd behavior understanding. The main idea is to train a set of
emotion-based classifiers, which can subsequently be used to represent the
crowd motion. For this purpose, we collect a big dataset of video clips and
provide them with both annotations of &quot;crowd behaviors&quot; and &quot;crowd emotions&quot;.
We show the results of the proposed method on our dataset, which demonstrate
that the crowd emotions enable the construction of more descriptive models for
crowd behaviors. We aim at publishing the dataset with the article, to be used
as a benchmark for the communities.

 <dc:description>  We propose a method for tracking an unknown number of targets based on
measurements provided by multiple sensors. Our method achieves low
computational complexity and excellent scalability by running belief
propagation on a suitably devised factor graph. A redundant formulation of data
association uncertainty and the use of &quot;augmented target states&quot; including
binary target indicators make it possible to exploit statistical independencies
for a drastic reduction of complexity. An increase in the number of targets,
sensors, or measurements leads to additional variable nodes in the factor graph
but not to higher dimensions of the messages. As a consequence, the complexity
of our method scales only quadratically in the number of targets, linearly in
the number of sensors, and linearly in the number of measurements per sensors.
The performance of the method compares well with that of previously proposed
methods, including methods with a less favorable scaling behavior. In
particular, our method can outperform multisensor versions of the probability
hypothesis density (PHD) filter, the cardinalized PHD filter, and the
multi-Bernoulli filter.

 <dc:description>  Vehicular adhoc networks allow vehicles to share their information for safety
and traffic efficiency. However, sharing information may threaten the driver
privacy because it includes spatiotemporal information and is broadcast
publicly and periodically. In this paper, we propose a context-adaptive
pseudonym changing scheme which lets a vehicle decide autonomously when to
change its pseudonym and how long it should remain silent to ensure
unlinkability. This scheme adapts dynamically based on the density of the
surrounding traffic and the user privacy preferences. We employ a multi-target
tracking algorithm to measure privacy in terms of traceability in realistic
vehicle traces. We use Monte Carlo analysis to estimate the quality of service
(QoS) of a forward collision warning application when vehicles apply this
scheme. According to the experimental results, the proposed scheme provides a
better compromise between traceability and QoS than a random silent period
scheme.

 <dc:description>  Job search through online matching engines nowadays are very prominent and
beneficial to both job seekers and employers. But the solutions of traditional
engines without understanding the semantic meanings of different resumes have
not kept pace with the incredible changes in machine learning techniques and
computing capability. These solutions are usually driven by manual rules and
predefined weights of keywords which lead to an inefficient and frustrating
search experience. To this end, we present a machine learned solution with rich
features and deep learning methods. Our solution includes three configurable
modules that can be plugged with little restrictions. Namely, unsupervised
feature extraction, base classifiers training and ensemble method learning. In
our solution, rather than using manual rules, machine learned methods to
automatically detect the semantic similarity of positions are proposed. Then
four competitive &quot;shallow&quot; estimators and &quot;deep&quot; estimators are selected.
Finally, ensemble methods to bag these estimators and aggregate their
individual predictions to form a final prediction are verified. Experimental
results of over 47 thousand resumes show that our solution can significantly
improve the predication precision current position, salary, educational
background and company scale.

 <dc:description>  Computing the epipolar geometry between cameras with very different
viewpoints is often very difficult. The appearance of objects can vary greatly,
and it is difficult to find corresponding feature points. Prior methods
searched for corresponding epipolar lines using points on the convex hull of
the silhouette of a single moving object. These methods fail when the scene
includes multiple moving objects. This paper extends previous work to scenes
having multiple moving objects by using the &quot;Motion Barcodes&quot;, a temporal
signature of lines. Corresponding epipolar lines have similar motion barcodes,
and candidate pairs of corresponding epipoar lines are found by the similarity
of their motion barcodes. As in previous methods we assume that cameras are
relatively stationary and that moving objects have already been extracted using
background subtraction.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel method for semantic segmentation, the task of labeling
each pixel in an image with a semantic class. Our method combines the
advantages of the two main competing paradigms. Methods based on region
classification offer proper spatial support for appearance measurements, but
typically operate in two separate stages, none of which targets pixel labeling
performance at the end of the pipeline. More recent fully convolutional methods
are capable of end-to-end training for the final pixel labeling, but resort to
fixed patches as spatial support. We show how to modify modern region-based
approaches to enable end-to-end training for semantic segmentation. This is
achieved via a differentiable region-to-pixel layer and a differentiable
free-form Region-of-Interest pooling layer. Our method improves the
state-of-the-art in terms of class-average accuracy with 64.0% on SIFT Flow and
49.9% on PASCAL Context, and is particularly accurate at object boundaries.

 <dc:description>  We study the selection problem, namely that of computing the $i$th order
statistic of $n$ given elements. Here we offer a data structure called
\emph{selectable sloppy heap} handling a dynamic version in which upon request:
(i)~a new element is inserted or (ii)~an element of a prescribed quantile group
is deleted from the data structure. Each operation is executed in (ideal!)
constant time---and is thus independent of $n$ (the number of elements stored
in the data structure)---provided that the number of quantile groups is fixed.
This is the first result of this kind accommodating both insertion and deletion
in constant time. As such, our data structure outperforms the soft heap data
structure of Chazelle (which only offers constant amortized complexity for a
fixed error rate $0&lt;\varepsilon \leq 1/2$) in applications such as dynamic
percentile maintenance. The design demonstrates how slowing down a certain
computation can speed up the data structure.

 <dc:description>  We consider problems of two-user secret key generation through an
intermediate relay. Each user observes correlated source sequences and
communicates to the relay over rate-limited noiseless links. The relay
processes and broadcasts information to the two users over another rate-limited
link. The users then generate a common secret key based on their sources and
information from the relay. In the untrusted relay setting, the goal is to
establish key agreement between the two users at the highest key rate without
leaking information about the key to the relay. We characterize inner and outer
bounds to the optimal tradeoff between communication and key rates. The inner
bound is based on the scheme which involves a combination of binning, network
coding, and key aggregation techniques. For the trusted relay setting with a
public broadcast link, the optimal communication-key rate tradeoff is provided
for a special case where the two sources are available losslessly at the relay.
The results can be relevant for cloud-based secret key generation services.

 <dc:description>  In the Token Swapping problem we are given a graph with a token placed on
each vertex. Each token has exactly one destination vertex, and we try to move
all the tokens to their destinations, using the minimum number of swaps, i.e.,
operations of exchanging the tokens on two adjacent vertices. As the main
result of this paper, we show that Token Swapping is $W[1]$-hard parameterized
by the length $k$ of a shortest sequence of swaps. In fact, we prove that, for
any computable function $f$, it cannot be solved in time $f(k)n^{o(k / \log
k)}$ where $n$ is the number of vertices of the input graph, unless the ETH
fails. This lower bound almost matches the trivial $n^{O(k)}$-time algorithm.
  We also consider two generalizations of the Token Swapping, namely Colored
Token Swapping (where the tokens have different colors and tokens of the same
color are indistinguishable), and Subset Token Swapping (where each token has a
set of possible destinations). To complement the hardness result, we prove that
even the most general variant, Subset Token Swapping, is FPT in nowhere-dense
graph classes.
  Finally, we consider the complexities of all three problems in very
restricted classes of graphs: graphs of bounded treewidth and diameter, stars,
cliques, and paths, trying to identify the borderlines between polynomial and
NP-hard cases.

 <dc:description>  One impressive advantage of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is their
ability to automatically learn feature representation from raw pixels,
eliminating the need for hand-designed procedures. However, recent methods for
single image super-resolution (SR) fail to maintain this advantage. They
utilize CNNs in two decoupled steps, i.e., first upsampling the low resolution
(LR) image to the high resolution (HR) size with hand-designed techniques
(e.g., bicubic interpolation), and then applying CNNs on the upsampled LR image
to reconstruct HR results. In this paper, we seek an alternative and propose a
new image SR method, which jointly learns the feature extraction, upsampling
and HR reconstruction modules, yielding a completely end-to-end trainable deep
CNN. As opposed to existing approaches, the proposed method conducts upsampling
in the latent feature space with filters that are optimized for the task of
image SR. In addition, the HR reconstruction is performed in a multi-scale
manner to simultaneously incorporate both short- and long-range contextual
information, ensuring more accurate restoration of HR images. To facilitate
network training, a new training approach is designed, which jointly trains the
proposed deep network with a relatively shallow network, leading to faster
convergence and more superior performance. The proposed method is extensively
evaluated on widely adopted data sets and improves the performance of
state-of-the-art methods with a considerable margin. Moreover, in-depth
ablation studies are conducted to verify the contribution of different network
designs to image SR, providing additional insights for future research.

 <dc:description>  This survey outlines a general and modular theory for proving approximation
guarantees for equilibria of auctions in complex settings. This theory
complements traditional economic techniques, which generally focus on exact and
optimal solutions and are accordingly limited to relatively stylized settings.
  We highlight three user-friendly analytical tools: smoothness-type
inequalities, which immediately yield approximation guarantees for many auction
formats of interest in the special case of complete information and
deterministic strategies; extension theorems, which extend such guarantees to
randomized strategies, no-regret learning outcomes, and incomplete-information
settings; and composition theorems, which extend such guarantees from simpler
to more complex auctions. Combining these tools yields tight worst-case
approximation guarantees for the equilibria of many widely-used auction
formats.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new framework, called Hierarchical Multi-resolution Mesh
Networks (HMMNs), which establishes a set of brain networks at multiple time
resolutions of fMRI signal to represent the underlying cognitive process. The
suggested framework, first, decomposes the fMRI signal into various frequency
subbands using wavelet transforms. Then, a brain network, called mesh network,
is formed at each subband by ensembling a set of local meshes. The locality
around each anatomic region is defined with respect to a neighborhood system
based on functional connectivity. The arc weights of a mesh are estimated by
ridge regression formed among the average region time series. In the final
step, the adjacency matrices of mesh networks obtained at different subbands
are ensembled for brain decoding under a hierarchical learning architecture,
called, fuzzy stacked generalization (FSG). Our results on Human Connectome
Project task-fMRI dataset reflect that the suggested HMMN model can
successfully discriminate tasks by extracting complementary information
obtained from mesh arc weights of multiple subbands. We study the topological
properties of the mesh networks at different resolutions using the network
measures, namely, node degree, node strength, betweenness centrality and global
efficiency; and investigate the connectivity of anatomic regions, during a
cognitive task. We observe significant variations among the network topologies
obtained for different subbands. We, also, analyze the diversity properties of
classifier ensemble, trained by the mesh networks in multiple subbands and
observe that the classifiers in the ensemble collaborate with each other to
fuse the complementary information freed at each subband. We conclude that the
fMRI data, recorded during a cognitive task, embed diverse information across
the anatomic regions at each resolution.

 <dc:title>Parallelized Proximity-Based Query Processing Methods for Road Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tsatsanifos, George</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a paradigm for processing in parallel graph joins
in road networks. The methodology we present can be used for distance join
processing among the elements of two disjoint sets R,S of nodes from the road
network, with R preceding S, and we are in search for the pairs of vertices
(u,v), where u in R and v in S, such that dist(u,v) &lt; {\theta}. Another
variation of the problem would involve retrieving the k closest pairs (u,v) in
the road network with u in R and v in S, such that dist(u,v) &lt;= dist(w,y),
where w,y do not belong in the result.
  We reckon that this is an extremely useful paradigm with many practical
applications. A typical example of usage of our methods would be to find the
pairs of restaurants and bars (in that order) from which to select for a night
out, that either fall within walking distance for example, or just the k
closest pairs, depending on the parameters. Another entirely different scenario
would involve finding the points of two distinct trajectories that are within a
certain distance predicate, or the k closest such points. For example, we would
like to transfer from one train to another a few tones of freight, and hence,
we want to minimize the distance we have to cover for moving the cargo from the
carrying train to the other. We reckon that this endeavor of ours covers
exactly those needs for processing such queries efficiently.
  Moreover, for the specific purposes of this paper, we also propose a novel
heuristic graph partitioning scheme. It resembles a recursive bisection method,
and is tailored to the requirements of the problem, targeting at establishing
well separated partitions, so as to allow computations to be performed
simultaneously and independently within each partition, unlike hitherto work
that aims at minimizing either the number of edges among different partitions,
or the number of nodes thereof.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new feedback-channel-free Distributed Video
Coding (DVC) algorithm using Local Rank Transform (LRT). The encoder computes
LRT by considering selected neighborhood pixels of Wyner-Ziv frame. The ranks
from the modified LRT are merged, and their positions are entropy coded and
sent to the decoder. In addition, means of each block of Wyner-Ziv frame are
also transmitted to assist motion estimation. Using these measurements, the
decoder generates side information (SI) by implementing motion estimation and
compensation in LRT domain. An iterative algorithm is executed on SI using LRT
to reconstruct the Wyner-Ziv frame. Experimental results show that the coding
efficiency of our codec is close to the efficiency of pixel domain distributed
video coders based on Low-Density Parity Check and Accumulate (LDPCA) or turbo
codes, with less encoder complexity.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to establish a theory of random variables on
domains. Domain theory is a fundamental component of theoretical computer
science, providing mathematical models of computational processes. Random
variables are the mainstay of probability theory. Since computational models
increasingly involve probabilistic aspects, it's only natural to explore the
relationship between these two areas. Our main results show how to cast results
about random variables using a domain-theoretic approach. The pay-off is an
extension of the results from probability measures to sub-probability measures.
We also use our approach to extend the class of domains for which we can
classify the domain structure of the space of sub-probability measures.

 <dc:description>  A genetic algorithm procedure is demonstrated that refines the selection of
interpolation points of the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) when
used for constructing reduced order models for time dependent and/or
parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with proper
orthogonal decomposition. The method achieves nearly optimal interpolation
points with only a few generations of the search, making it potentially useful
for {\em online} refinement of the sparse sampling used to construct a
projection of the nonlinear terms. With the genetic algorithm, points are
optimized to jointly minimize reconstruction error and enable dynamic regime
classification. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated on two canonical
nonlinear PDEs: the cubic-quintic Ginzburg-Landau equation and the
Navier-Stokes equation for flow around a cylinder. Using the former model, the
procedure can be compared to the ground-truth optimal interpolation points,
showing that the genetic algorithm quickly achieves nearly optimal performance
and reduced the reconstruction error by nearly an order of magnitude.

assumptions. Viewed at first with skepticism by the Internet users in Romania,
because of the many news about how dangerous the credit card payments are, the
online stores have gained much ground and trust in the recent years. Since the
study was conducted mainly in the online environment, we can not talk about the

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  OCDMA systems can support multiple classes of service by differentiating code
parameters, power level and diversity order. In this paper, we analyze BER
performance of a multi-class 1D/2D OCDMA system and propose a new approximation
method that can be used to generate accurate estimation of system BER using a
simple mathematical form. The proposed approximation provides insight into
proper system level analysis, system level design and sensitivity of system
performance to the factors such as code parameters, power level and diversity
order. Considering code design, code cardinality and system performance
constraints, two design problems are defined and their optimal solutions are
provided. We then propose an adaptive OCDMA-PON that adaptively shares unused
resources of inactive users among active ones to improve upstream system
performance. Using the approximated BER expression and defined design problems,
two adaptive code allocation algorithms for the adaptive OCDMA-PON are
presented and their performances are evaluated by simulation. Simulation
results show that the adaptive code allocation algorithms can increase average
transmission rate or decrease average optical power consumption of ONUs for
dynamic traffic patterns. According to the simulation results, for an adaptive
OCDMA-PON with BER value of 1e-7 and user activity probability of 0.5,
transmission rate (optical power consumption) can be increased (decreased) by a
factor of 2.25 (0.27) compared to fixed code assignment.

 <dc:description>  We aim to review available literature related to the telemonitoring of
maternal health care for a comprehensive understanding of the roles of Medical
Cyber-Physical-Systems (MCPS) as cutting edge technology in maternal risk
factor management, and for understanding the possible research gap in the
domain. In this regard, we search literature through google scholar and PubMed
databases for published studies that focus on maternal telemonitoring systems
using sensors, Cyber-Physical-System (CPS) and information decision systems for
addressing risk factors We extract 1340 articles relevant to maternal health
care that addresses different risk factors as their managerial issues. Of a
large number of relevant articles, we included 26 prospective studies relating
to sensors or Medical Cyber-Physical-Systems (MCPS) based maternal
telemonitoring. Of the 1340 primary articles, we have short-listed 26 articles
(12 articles for risk factor analysis, 9 for synthesis matrices and 5 papers
for finding essential elements. We have extracted 17 vital symptoms as maternal
risk factors during pregnancy. Moreover, we have identified a number of
cyber-frameworks as the basis of information decision support system to cope
with the different maternal complexities. We have found the Medical
Cyber-Physical System (MCPS) as a promising technology to manage the vital risk
factors quickly and efficiently by the care provider from a distant place to
reduce the fatal risks. Despite communication issues, MCPS is a key-enabling
technology to cope with the advancement of telemonitoring paradigm in the
maternal health care system.

 <dc:description>  The importance and demands of visual scene understanding have been steadily
increasing along with the active development of autonomous systems.
Consequently, there has been a large amount of research dedicated to semantic
segmentation and dense motion estimation. In this paper, we propose a method
for jointly estimating optical flow and temporally consistent semantic
segmentation, which closely connects these two problem domains and leverages
each other. Semantic segmentation provides information on plausible physical
motion to its associated pixels, and accurate pixel-level temporal
correspondences enhance the accuracy of semantic segmentation in the temporal
domain. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on the KITTI benchmark,
where we observe performance gains for flow and segmentation. We achieve
state-of-the-art optical flow results, and outperform all published algorithms
by a large margin on challenging, but crucial dynamic objects.

 <dc:title>Spectrum-Convertible BVWXC Placement in OFDM-based Elastic Optical

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Spectrum conversion can improve the performance of OFDM-based Elastic Optical
Networks (EONs) by relaxing the continuity constraint and consequently reducing
connection request blocking probability during Routing and Spectrum Assignment
(RSA) process. We propose three different architectures for including spectrum
conversion capability in Bandwidth-Variable Wavelength Cross-Connects (BVWXCs).
To compare the capability of the introduced architectures, we develop an
analytical method for computing average connection request blocking probability
in a spectrum-convertible OFDM-based EON in which all, part or none of the
BVWXCs can convert the spectrum. An algorithm for distributing a limited number
of Spectrum-Convertible Bandwidth-Variable Wavelength Cross-Connects (SCBVWXCs)
in an OFDM-based EON is also proposed. Finally, we use simulation results to
evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method for calculating connection request
blocking probability and the capability of the introduced algorithm for SCBVWXC
placement.

 <dc:description>  In the design of software and cyber-physical systems, security is often
perceived as a qualitative need, but can only be attained quantitatively.
Especially when distributed components are involved, it is hard to predict and
confront all possible attacks. A main challenge in the development of complex
systems is therefore to discover attacks, quantify them to comprehend their
likelihood, and communicate them to non-experts for facilitating the decision
process. To address this three-sided challenge we propose a protection analysis
over the Quality Calculus that (i) computes all the sets of data required by an
attacker to reach a given location in a system, (ii) determines the cheapest
set of such attacks for a given notion of cost, and (iii) derives an attack
tree that displays the attacks graphically. The protection analysis is first
developed in a qualitative setting, and then extended to quantitative settings
following an approach applicable to a great many contexts. The quantitative
formulation is implemented as an optimisation problem encoded into
Satisfiability Modulo Theories, allowing us to deal with complex cost
structures. The usefulness of the framework is demonstrated on a national-scale
authentication system, studied through a Java implementation of the framework.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a software-based technique to recover control-flow errors
in multithreaded programs. Control-flow error recovery is achieved through
inserting additional instructions into multithreaded program at compile time
regarding to two dependency graphs. These graphs are extracted to model
control-flow and data dependencies among basic blocks and thread interactions
between different threads of a program. In order to evaluate the proposed
technique, three multithreaded benchmarks quick sort, matrix multiplication and
linked list utilized to run on a multi-core processor, and a total of 5000
transient faults has been injected into several executable points of each
program. The results show that this technique detects and corrects between
91.9% and 93.8% of the injected faults with acceptable performance and memory
overheads.

 <dc:title>A Model of Pathways to Artificial Superintelligence Catastrophe for Risk
  and Decision Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Barrett, Anthony M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Baum, Seth D.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An artificial superintelligence (ASI) is artificial intelligence that is
significantly more intelligent than humans in all respects. While ASI does not
currently exist, some scholars propose that it could be created sometime in the
future, and furthermore that its creation could cause a severe global
catastrophe, possibly even resulting in human extinction. Given the high
stakes, it is important to analyze ASI risk and factor the risk into decisions
related to ASI research and development. This paper presents a graphical model
of major pathways to ASI catastrophe, focusing on ASI created via recursive
self-improvement. The model uses the established risk and decision analysis
modeling paradigms of fault trees and influence diagrams in order to depict
combinations of events and conditions that could lead to AI catastrophe, as
well as intervention options that could decrease risks. The events and
conditions include select aspects of the ASI itself as well as the human
process of ASI research, development, and management. Model structure is
derived from published literature on ASI risk. The model offers a foundation
for rigorous quantitative evaluation and decision making on the long-term risk
of ASI catastrophe.

 <dc:description>  We consider the following natural &quot;above guarantee&quot; parameterization of the
classical Longest Path problem: For given vertices s and t of a graph G, and an
integer k, the problem Longest Detour asks for an (s,t)-path in G that is at
least k longer than a shortest (s,t)-path. Using insights into structural graph
theory, we prove that Longest Detour is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) on
undirected graphs and actually even admits a single-exponential algorithm, that
is, one of running time exp(O(k)) poly(n). This matches (up to the base of the
exponential) the best algorithms for finding a path of length at least k.
  Furthermore, we study the related problem Exact Detour that asks whether a
graph G contains an (s,t)-path that is exactly k longer than a shortest
(s,t)-path. For this problem, we obtain a randomized algorithm with running
time about 2.746^k, and a deterministic algorithm with running time about
6.745^k, showing that this problem is FPT as well. Our algorithms for Exact
Detour apply to both undirected and directed graphs.

 <dc:description>  Unstructured data refers to information that does not have a predefined data
model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner. Loosely speaking,
unstructured data refers to text data that is generated by humans. In
after-sales service businesses, there are two main sources of unstructured
data: customer complaints, which generally describe symptoms, and technician
comments, which outline diagnostics and treatment information. A legitimate
customer complaint can eventually be tracked to a failure or a claim. However,
there is a delay between the time of a customer complaint and the time of a
failure or a claim. A proactive strategy aimed at analyzing customer complaints
for symptoms can help service providers detect reliability problems in advance
and initiate corrective actions such as recalls. This paper introduces
essential text mining concepts in the context of reliability analysis and a
method to detect emerging reliability issues. The application of the method is
illustrated using a case study.

 <dc:description>  Background Information: Falls are associated with high direct and indirect
costs, and significant morbidity and mortality for patients. Pathological falls
are usually a result of a compromised motor system, and/or cognition. Very
little research has been conducted on predicting falls based on this premise.
  Aims: To demonstrate that cognitive and motor tests can be used to create a
robust predictive tool for falls.
  Methods: Three tests of attention and executive function (Stroop, Trail
Making, and Semantic Fluency), a measure of physical function (Walk-12), a
series of questions (concerning recent falls, surgery and physical function)
and demographic information were collected from a cohort of 323 patients at a
tertiary neurological center. The principal outcome was a fall during the
in-patient stay (n = 54). Data-driven, predictive modelling was employed to
identify the statistical modelling strategies which are most accurate in
predicting falls, and which yield the most parsimonious models of clinical
relevance.
  Results: The Trail test was identified as the best predictor of falls.
Moreover, addition of any others variables, to the results of the Trail test
did not improve the prediction (Wilcoxon signed-rank p &lt; .001). The best
statistical strategy for predicting falls was the random forest (Wilcoxon
signed-rank p &lt; .001), based solely on results of the Trail test. Tuning of the
model results in the following optimized values: 68% (+- 7.7) sensitivity, 90%
(+- 2.3) specificity, with a positive predictive value of 60%, when the
relevant data is available.
  Conclusion: Predictive modelling has identified a simple yet powerful machine
learning prediction strategy based on a single clinical test, the Trail test.
Predictive evaluation shows this strategy to be robust, suggesting predictive
modelling and machine learning as the standard for future predictive tools.

 <dc:description>  Controllability of multi-agent systems is determined by the interconnection
topologies. In practice, losing agents can change the topologies of multi-agent
systems, which may affect the controllability. This paper studies non-fragility
of controllability influenced by losing agents. In virtue of the concept of
cutsets, necessary and sufficient conditions are established from a graphic
perspective, for strong non-fragility and weak non-fragility of
controllability, respectively. For multi-agent systems which contain important
agents, partial controllability is proposed in terms of the concept of
controllable node groups, and necessary and sufficient criteria are established
for partial controllability. Moreover, partial controllability preserving
problem is proposed. Utilizing the concept of compressed graphs, this problem
is transformed into finding the the minimal $\mathbf{\langle s,t\rangle}$
vertex cutsets of the interconnection graph, which has a polynomial-time
complexity algorithm for the solution. Several constructive examples illuminate
the theoretical results.

 <dc:title>New security notions and feasibility results for authentication of

 <dc:creator>Garg, Sumegha</dc:creator>

 <dc:creator>Zhandry, Mark</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We give a new class of security definitions for authentication in the quantum
setting. These definitions capture and strengthen existing definitions of
security against quantum adversaries for both classical message authentication
codes (MACs) and well as full quantum state authentication schemes. The main
feature of our definitions is that they precisely characterize the effective
behavior of any adversary when the authentication protocol accepts, including
correlations with the key. Our definitions readily yield a host of desirable
properties and interesting consequences; for example, our security definition
for full quantum state authentication implies that the entire secret key can be
re-used if the authentication protocol succeeds.
  Next, we present several protocols satisfying our security definitions. We
show that the classical Wegman-Carter authentication scheme with 3-universal
hashing is secure against superposition attacks, as well as adversaries with
quantum side information. We then present conceptually simple constructions of
full quantum state authentication.
  Finally, we prove a lifting theorem which shows that, as long as a protocol
can securely authenticate the maximally entangled state, it can securely
authenticate any state, even those that are entangled with the adversary. Thus,
this shows that protocols satisfying a fairly weak form of authentication
security automatically satisfy a stronger notion of security (in particular,
the definition of Dupuis, et al (2012)).
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: 50 pages, QCrypt 2016 - 6th International Conference on Quantum
  Cryptography, added a new lifting theorem that shows equivalence between a
  weak form of authentication security and a stronger notion that considers
  side information</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  We present a new, novel approach to obtaining a network's connectivity. More
specifically, we show that there exists a relationship between a network's
graph isoperimetric properties and its conditional connectivity. A network's
connectivity is the minimum number of nodes, whose removal will cause the
network disconnected. It is a basic and important measure for the network's
reliability, hence its overall robustness. Several conditional connectivities
have been proposed in the past for the purpose of accurately reflecting various
realistic network situations, with extra connectivity being one such
conditional connectivity. In this paper, we will use isoperimetric properties
of the hypercube network to obtain its extra connectivity. The result of the
paper for the first time establishes a relationship between the age-old
isoperimetric problem and network connectivity.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a framework for model learning and planning in stochastic
domains with continuous state and action spaces and non-Gaussian transition
models. It is efficient because (1) local models are estimated only when the
planner requires them; (2) the planner focuses on the most relevant states to
the current planning problem; and (3) the planner focuses on the most
informative and/or high-value actions. Our theoretical analysis shows the
validity and asymptotic optimality of the proposed approach. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on a simulated multi-modal

scheduling scheme and a fluid model. The first formulation is a mixed-integer
nonlinear program, since the scheduling problem is intuitively considered as an
assignment problem. However, by changing the scheduling problem to first
determine a task workload partition and then to find the execution order of all
tasks, the computation time can be significantly reduced. Specifically, the
workload partitioning problem can be formulated as a continuous nonlinear
program for a system with continuous operating frequency, and as a continuous
linear program for a practical system with a discrete speed level set. The task
ordering problem can be solved by an algorithm with a complexity that is linear
in the total number of tasks. The work is evaluated against existing global
energy/feasibility optimal workload allocation formulations. The results
illustrate that our algorithms are both feasibility optimal and energy optimal
for both implicit and constrained deadline tasksets. Specifically, our
algorithm can achieve up to 40% energy saving for some simulated tasksets with
constrained deadlines. The benefit of our formulation compared with existing
work is that our algorithms can solve a more general class of scheduling
problems due to incorporating a scheduling dynamic model in the formulations
and allowing for a time-varying speed profile. Moreover, our algorithms can be
applied to both online and offline scheduling schemes.

 <dc:description>  This document is part of the deliverables created by the International Rights
Statement Working Group, a joint working group of the Digital Public Library of
America (DPLA) and Europeana. It provides the technical requirements for
implementation of the Standardized International Rights Statements. These
requirements are based on the principles and specifications found in the
normative Recommendations for Standardized International Rights Statements.
This document replaces and supersedes the previously released Recommendations
for the Technical Infrastructure for Standardized Rights Statements, released
by this working group. The Requirements for the Technical Infrastructure for
Standardized International Rights Statements describes the expected behaviours
for a service that enables the delivery of human and machine-readable
representations of the rights statements. It documents the fundamental
decisions that informed the development of a data model grounded in Linked Data
approaches. This document also provides proposed implementation guidelines and
a non-normative set of examples for incorporating rights statements into
provider metadata.

 <dc:title>Uber: Utilizing Buffers to Simplify NoCs for Hundreds-Cores</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Passas, Giorgos</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Approaching ideal wire latency using a network-on-chip (NoC) is an important
practical problem for many-core systems, particularly hundreds-cores. Although
other researchers have focused on optimizing large meshes, bypassing or
speculating router pipelines, or creating more intricate logarithmic
topologies, this paper proposes a balanced combination that trades queue
buffers for simplicity. Preliminary analysis of nine benchmarks from PARSEC and
SPLASH using execution-driven simulation shows that utilization rises from 2%
when connecting a single core per mesh port to at least 50%, as slack for delay
in concentrator and router queues is around 6x higher compared to the ideal
latency of just 20 cycles. That is, a 16-port mesh suffices because queueing is
the uncommon case for system performance. In this way, the mesh hop count is
bounded to three, as load becomes uniform via extended concentration, and ideal
latency is approached using conventional four-stage pipelines for the mesh
routers together with minor logarithmic edges. A realistic Uber is also
detailed, featuring the same performance as a 64-port mesh that employs
optimized router pipelines, improving the baseline by 12%. Ongoing work
develops techniques to better balance load by tuning the placement of cache
blocks, and compares Uber with bufferless routing.

 <dc:title>Approximate Policy Iteration for Budgeted Semantic Video Segmentation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mahasseni, Behrooz</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  This paper formulates and presents a solution to the new problem of budgeted
semantic video segmentation. Given a video, the goal is to accurately assign a
semantic class label to every pixel in the video within a specified time
budget. Typical approaches to such labeling problems, such as Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs), focus on maximizing accuracy but do not provide a
principled method for satisfying a time budget. For video data, the time
required by CRF and related methods is often dominated by the time to compute
low-level descriptors of supervoxels across the video. Our key contribution is
the new budgeted inference framework for CRF models that intelligently selects
the most useful subsets of descriptors to run on subsets of supervoxels within
the time budget. The objective is to maintain an accuracy as close as possible
to the CRF model with no time bound, while remaining within the time budget.
Our second contribution is the algorithm for learning a policy for the sparse
selection of supervoxels and their descriptors for budgeted CRF inference. This
learning algorithm is derived by casting our problem in the framework of Markov
Decision Processes, and then instantiating a state-of-the-art policy learning
algorithm known as Classification-Based Approximate Policy Iteration. Our
experiments on multiple video datasets show that our learning approach and
framework is able to significantly reduce computation time, and maintain
competitive accuracy under varying budgets.

 <dc:title>A Step towards Advanced Metering for the Smart Grid: A Survey of Energy
  Monitors</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The smart grid initiative has encouraged utility companies worldwide to
rollout new and smarter versions of energy meters. Before an extensive rollout,
which is both labor-intensive and incurs high capital costs, consumers need to
be incentivized to reap the long-term benefits of smart grid. Off-the-shelf
energy monitors can provide consumers with an insight of such potential
benefits. Since energy monitors are owned by the consumer, the consumer has
greater control over data which significantly reduces privacy and data
confidentiality concerns. We evaluate several existing energy monitors using an
online technical survey and online product literature. For consumers, the use
of different off-the-shelf energy monitors can help demonstrate the potential
gains of smart grid. Our survey indicates a trend towards incorporation of
state-of-the-art capabilities, like appliance level monitoring through load
disaggregation in energy monitors, which can encourage effective consumer
participation. Multiple sensor types and ratings allow some monitors to operate
in various configurations and environments.

with the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), taking as starting point abstracts
of articles. Through the time, abstracts have been evolving towards higher
complexity on used terminology, which makes necessary the use of sophisticated
statistical methods and answering questions including: how vocabulary is
evolving through the time? Which ones are most influential articles? And which
one are the articles that introduced new terms and vocabulary? To answer these,
we analyze a dataset composed by 506 abstracts and downloaded from 115
different journals and cover a 18 year-period.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we would like to propose our web-based application for Islamic
history learning system, named Digitory-Digital History. There are two main
navigations to browse historical stories on the web. One is location-based
navigation using on-line map which gives users access to understand events
during Islamic introduction to Indonesia based on the location. Alternatively,
users can browse on time base using sliding navigation marked timely, so they
can comprehend history in time sequence. Implementing semantic web, this
web-app can suggest users related articles, either based on time series,
location similarities, or time-domain similarities, and also suggest pictures
related to the articles. AJAX strengthen the real-time access and interactivity
as users navigate around the web. By the end of this research, we will have the
web-app prototype completed with its fundamental location-based navigation,
semantic relationship among articles and pictures, and time- based navigation
system. As the web-app deployed, we have some volunteers to try our application
so that we can evaluate its result, particularly its effectiveness.

 <dc:description>  The high increase in the number of companies competing in mature markets
makes customer retention an important factor for any company to survive. Thus,
many methodologies (e.g., data mining and statistics) have been proposed to
analyse and study customer retention. The validity of such methods is not yet
proved though. This paper tries to fill this gap by empirically comparing two
techniques: Customer churn-decision tree and logistic regression models. The
paper proves the superiority of decision tree technique and stresses the needs
for more advanced methods to churn modelling.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a design tool to investigate the properties and emergent
behaviours of a special class of Ambient Assisted Living systems, namely mutual
assistance communities where the dwellers contribute to each other's well
being. Purpose of our system is to understand how mutual assistance communities
work, what consequences a design decision could ultimately bring about, and how
to construct care communities providing timely and cost-effective service for
elderly and disabled people. We prove that mutual assistance between dwellers
can provide care in time, and decrease the requirement for professional medical
service. The simulation results show that with the existing rules most of the
requirements for help can be solved or promptly initiated inside the community
before their members resort to external professionals.

information technologies and quantitative methods used to assist stakeholders
to make better decisions. The contemporary business environment is dramatically
changing by the massive accumulation of data. Now, as never before, the use of
analytical tools must be expanded to take advantage of this growing digital
universe. This article will apply the laddering technique to see how personal
values (or managerial functions) influence a companys adoption of analytical
tools. A set of ten in-depth interviews are conducted with CEOs, analytics
consultants, academics and businessmen in order to establish quantitative
relations among attributes, consequences and personal values. Two easy-to-read
outputs are provided to interpret our results. The most important links are
quantitatively associated through an implication matrix, and then visually
represented on a hierarchical value map. Guidelines for improving the use of
analytical tools are provided in the last section

 <dc:description>  We propose a hierarchical design framework to automatically synthesize
coordination schemes and control policies for cooperative multi-agent systems
to fulfill formal performance requirements, by associating a bottom-up reactive
motion controller with a top-down mission plan. On one hand, starting from a
global mission that is specified as a regular language over all the agents'
mission capabilities, a mission planning layer sits on the top of the proposed
framework, decomposing the global mission into local tasks that are in
consistency with each agent's individual capabilities, and compositionally
justifying whether the achievement of local tasks implies the satisfaction of
the global mission via an assume-guarantee paradigm. On the other hand,
bottom-up motion plans associated with each agent are synthesized corresponding
to the obtained local missions by composing basic motion primitives, which are
verified safe by differential dynamic logic (d$\mathcal{L}$), through a
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver that searches feasible solutions in
face of constraints imposed by local task requirements and the environment
description. It is shown that the proposed framework can handle dynamical
environments as the motion primitives possess reactive features, making the
motion plans adaptive to local environmental changes. Furthermore, on-line
mission reconfiguration can be triggered by the motion planning layer once no
feasible solutions can be found through the SMT solver. The effectiveness of
the overall design framework is validated by an automated warehouse case study.

 <dc:description>  We present experimental data on message transmission in a free-space optical
(FSO) link at an eye-safe wavelength, using a testbed consisting of one sender
and two receiver terminals, where the latter two are a legitimate receiver and
an eavesdropper. The testbed allows us to emulate a typical scenario of
physical-layer (PHY) security such as satellite-to-ground laser communications.
We estimate information-theoretic metrics including secrecy rate, secrecy
outage probability, and expected code lengths for given secrecy criteria based
on observed channel statistics. We then discuss operation principles of secure
message transmission under realistic fading conditions, and provide a guideline
on a multi-layer security architecture by combining PHY security and
upper-layer (algorithmic) security.

 <dc:title>ABROA : Audio-Based Room-Occupancy Analysis using Gaussian Mixtures and
  Hidden Markov Models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Valle, Rafael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper outlines preliminary steps towards the development of an audio-
based room-occupancy analysis model. Our approach borrows from speech
recognition tradition and is based on Gaussian Mixtures and Hidden Markov
Models. We analyze possible challenges encountered in the development of such a
model, and offer several solutions including feature design and prediction
strategies. We provide results obtained from experiments with audio data from a
retail store in Palo Alto, California. Model assessment is done via
leave-two-out Bootstrap and model convergence achieves good accuracy, thus
representing a contribution to multimodal people counting algorithms.

 <dc:title>Error-Resilient Machine Learning in Near Threshold Voltage via
  Classifier Ensemble</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Sai</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shanbhag, Naresh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present the design of error-resilient machine learning
architectures by employing a distributed machine learning framework referred to
as classifier ensemble (CE). CE combines several simple classifiers to obtain a
strong one. In contrast, centralized machine learning employs a single complex
block. We compare the random forest (RF) and the support vector machine (SVM),
which are representative techniques from the CE and centralized frameworks,
respectively. Employing the dataset from UCI machine learning repository and
architectural-level error models in a commercial 45 nm CMOS process, it is
demonstrated that RF-based architectures are significantly more robust than SVM
architectures in presence of timing errors due to process variations in
near-threshold voltage (NTV) regions (0.3 V - 0.7 V). In particular, the RF
architecture exhibits a detection accuracy (P_{det}) that varies by 3.2% while
maintaining a median P_{det} &gt; 0.9 at a gate level delay variation of 28.9% .
In comparison, SVM exhibits a P_{det} that varies by 16.8%. Additionally, we
propose an error weighted voting technique that incorporates the timing error
statistics of the NTV circuit fabric to further enhance robustness. Simulation
results confirm that the error weighted voting achieves a P_{det} that varies
by only 1.4%, which is 12X lower compared to SVM.

 <dc:title>Strong Secrecy on a Class of Degraded Broadcast Channels Using Polar
  Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>del Olmo, Jaume</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Fonollosa, Javier R.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Different polar coding schemes are proposed for the memoryless degraded
broadcast channel under different reliability and secrecy requirements: layered
decoding and/or layered secrecy. In this setting, the transmitter wishes to
send multiple messages to a set of legitimate receivers keeping them masked
from a set of eavesdroppers. The layered decoding structure requires receivers
with better channel quality to reliably decode more messages, while the layered
secrecy structure requires eavesdroppers with worse channel quality to be kept
ignorant of more messages. The implementation of the proposed polar coding
schemes is discussed and their performance is evaluated by simulations for the
symmetric degraded broadcast channel.

 <dc:title>Prediction of future hospital admissions - what is the tradeoff between

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Large amounts of electronic medical records collected by hospitals across the
developed world offer unprecedented possibilities for knowledge discovery using
computer based data mining and machine learning. Notwithstanding significant
research efforts, the use of this data in the prediction of disease development
has largely been disappointing. In this paper we examine in detail a recently
proposed method which has in preliminary experiments demonstrated highly
promising results on real-world data. We scrutinize the authors' claims that
the proposed model is scalable and investigate whether the tradeoff between
prediction specificity (i.e. the ability of the model to predict a wide number
of different ailments) and accuracy (i.e. the ability of the model to make the
correct prediction) is practically viable. Our experiments conducted on a data
corpus of nearly 3,000,000 admissions support the authors' expectations and
demonstrate that the high prediction accuracy is maintained well even when the
number of admission types explicitly included in the model is increased to
account for 98% of all admissions in the corpus. Thus several promising
directions for future work are highlighted.

 <dc:description>  We are given a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges,
with positive weights on the edges, and a parameter $k &gt;0$. We show how to
compute, for every vertex $v \in V$, its $k$ nearest-neighbors. The algorithm
runs in $O( k ( n \log n + m ) )$ time, and follows by a somewhat careful
modification of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
  This result is probably folklore, but we were unable to find a reference to
it -- thus, this note.

 <dc:title>Natural Steganography: cover-source switching for better steganography</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bas, Patrick</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new steganographic scheme relying on the principle of
cover-source switching, the key idea being that the embedding should switch
from one cover-source to another. The proposed implementation, called Natural
Steganography, considers the sensor noise naturally present in the raw images
and uses the principle that, by the addition of a specific noise the
steganographic embedding tries to mimic a change of ISO sensitivity. The
embedding methodology consists in 1) perturbing the image in the raw domain, 2)
modeling the perturbation in the processed domain, 3) embedding the payload in
the processed domain. We show that this methodology is easily tractable
whenever the processes are known and enables to embed large and undetectable
payloads. We also show that already used heuristics such as synchronization of
embedding changes or detectability after rescaling can be respectively
explained by operations such as color demosaicing and down-scaling kernels.

 <dc:description>  Nominal sets provide a framework to study key notions of syntax and semantics
such as fresh names, variable binding and $\alpha$-equivalence on a
conveniently abstract categorical level. Coalgebras for endofunctors on nominal
sets model, e.g., various forms of automata with names as well as infinite
terms with variable binding operators (such as $\lambda$-abstraction). Here, we
first study the behaviour of orbit-finite coalgebras for functors $\bar F$ on
nominal sets that lift some finitary set functor $F$. We provide sufficient
conditions under which the rational fixpoint of $\bar F$, i.e. the collection
of all behaviours of orbit-finite $\bar F$-coalgebras, is the lifting of the
rational fixpoint of $F$. Second, we describe the rational fixpoint of the
quotient functors: we introduce the notion of a sub-strength of an endofunctor
on nominal sets, and we prove that for a functor $G$ with a sub-strength the
rational fixpoint of each quotient of $G$ is a canonical quotient of the
rational fixpoint of $G$. As applications, we obtain a concrete description of
the rational fixpoint for functors arising from so-called binding signatures
with exponentiation, such as those arising in coalgebraic models of infinitary
$\lambda$-terms and various flavours of automata.

 <dc:description>  We study streaming principal component analysis (PCA), that is to find, in
$O(dk)$ space, the top $k$ eigenvectors of a $d\times d$ hidden matrix $\bf
\Sigma$ with online vectors drawn from covariance matrix $\bf \Sigma$.
  We provide $\textit{global}$ convergence for Oja's algorithm which is
popularly used in practice but lacks theoretical understanding for $k&gt;1$. We
also provide a modified variant $\mathsf{Oja}^{++}$ that runs $\textit{even
faster}$ than Oja's. Our results match the information theoretic lower bound in
terms of dependency on error, on eigengap, on rank $k$, and on dimension $d$,
up to poly-log factors. In addition, our convergence rate can be made gap-free,
that is proportional to the approximation error and independent of the
eigengap.
  In contrast, for general rank $k$, before our work (1) it was open to design
any algorithm with efficient global convergence rate; and (2) it was open to
design any algorithm with (even local) gap-free convergence rate in $O(dk)$
space.

 <dc:description>  Multi-Variant Execution Environments (MVEEs) are a promising technique to
protect software against memory corruption attacks. They transparently execute
multiple, diversified variants (often referred to as replicae) of the software
receiving the same inputs. By enforcing and monitoring the lock-step execution
of the replicae's system calls, and by deploying diversity techniques that
prevent an attacker from simultaneously compromising multiple replicae, MVEEs
can block attacks before they succeed.
  Existing MVEEs cannot handle non-trivial multi-threaded programs because
their undeterministic behavior introduces benign system call inconsistencies in
the replicae, which trigger false positive detections and deadlocks in the
MVEEs. This paper for the first time extends the generality of MVEEs to protect
multi-threaded software by means of secure and efficient synchronization
replication agents. On the PARSEC 2.1 parallel benchmarks running with four
worker threads, our prototype MVEE incurs a run-time overhead of only 1.32x.

 <dc:description>  Virtual machine live migration in cloud environments aims at reducing energy
costs and increasing resource utilization. However, its potential has not been
fully explored because of simultaneous migrations that may cause user
application performance degradation and network congestion. Research efforts on
live migration orchestration policies still mostly rely on system level
metrics. This work introduces an Application-aware Live Migration Architecture
(ALMA) that selects suitable moments for migrations using application
characterization data. This characterization consists in recognizing resource
usage cycles via Fast Fourier Transform. From our experiments, live migration
times were reduced by up to 74% for benchmarks and by up to 67% for real
applications, when compared to migration policies with no application workload
analysis. Network data transfer during the live migration was reduced by up to
62%.

of Answer Set Programming (ASP), which is a declarative logic programming
formalism. Based on the idea of teaching by asking the student to complete
small example ASP programs, we introduce a three-stage method for giving hints
to the student without revealing the correct solution of an example. We
categorize mistakes into (i) syntactic mistakes, (ii) unexpected but
syntactically correct input, and (iii) semantic mistakes, describe mathematical
definitions of these mistakes, and show how to compute hints from these

 <dc:description>  We consider a problem of robotic router placement and mobility control with
the objective of formation and maintenance of an optimal communication network
between a set of transmitter-receiver pairs. In this scenario, the
communication path between any transmitter-receiver pair contains a
predetermined set of mobile robotic routers nodes. The goal of this work is to
design an algorithm to optimize the positions of the robotic nodes to improve
the overall performance of the network. We define the optimization metric to be
the minimum of the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratios (SINR) over all the
links. In this manuscript, we propose two optimization algorithms to solve this
problem in a centralized and a decentralized manner, respectively.We also
demonstrate the performances of both algorithms based on a set of simulation
experiments.

 <dc:description>  Validating Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is a strategic issue,
since such systems are becoming increasingly widespread in the automotive
field. ADAS bring extra comfort to drivers, and this has become a selling
point. But these functions, while useful, must not affect the general safety of
the vehicle which is the manufacturer's responsibility. A significant number of
current ADAS are based on vision systems, and applications such as obstacle
detection and detection of pedestrians have become essential components of
functions such as automatic emergency braking. These systems that preserve and
protect road users take on even more importance with the arrival of the new
Euro NCAP protocols. Therefore the robustness and reliability of ADAS functions
cannot be neglected and car manufacturers need to have tools to ensure that the
ADAS functions running on their vehicles operate with the utmost safety.
Furthermore, the complexity of these systems in conjunction with the nearly
infinite number of parameter combinations related to the usage profile of
functions based on image sensors push us to think about testing optimization
methods and tool standards to support the design and validation phases of ADAS
systems. The resources required for the validation using current methods make
them actually less and less adapted to new active safety features, which induce
very strong dependability requirements. Today, to test the camera-based ADAS,
test vehicles are equipped with these systems and are performing long hours of
driving that can last for years. These tests are used to validate the use of
the function and to verify its response to the requirements described in the
specifications without considering the functional safety standard ISO26262.

 <dc:title>Forward-Mode Automatic Differentiation in Julia</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present ForwardDiff, a Julia package for forward-mode automatic
differentiation (AD) featuring performance competitive with low-level languages
like C++. Unlike recently developed AD tools in other popular high-level
languages such as Python and MATLAB, ForwardDiff takes advantage of
just-in-time (JIT) compilation to transparently recompile AD-unaware user code,
enabling efficient support for higher-order differentiation and differentiation
using custom number types (including complex numbers). For gradient and
Jacobian calculations, ForwardDiff provides a variant of vector-forward mode
that avoids expensive heap allocation and makes better use of memory bandwidth
than traditional vector mode. In our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that
for nontrivially large dimensions, ForwardDiff's gradient computations can be
faster than a reverse-mode implementation from the Python-based autograd
package. We also illustrate how ForwardDiff is used effectively within JuMP, a
modeling language for optimization. According to our usage statistics, 41
unique repositories on GitHub depend on ForwardDiff, with users from diverse
fields such as astronomy, optimization, finite element analysis, and
statistics.
  This document is an extended abstract that has been accepted for presentation
at the AD2016 7th International Conference on Algorithmic Differentiation.

 <dc:title>Polling-systems-based Autonomous Vehicle Coordination in Traffic
  Intersections with No Traffic Signals</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The rapid development of autonomous vehicles spurred a careful investigation
of the potential benefits of all-autonomous transportation networks. Most
studies conclude that autonomous systems can enable drastic improvements in
performance. A widely studied concept is all-autonomous, collision-free
intersections, where vehicles arriving in a traffic intersection with no
traffic light adjust their speeds to cross safely through the intersection as
quickly as possible. In this paper, we propose a coordination control algorithm
for this problem, assuming stochastic models for the arrival times of the
vehicles. The proposed algorithm provides provable guarantees on safety and
performance. More precisely, it is shown that no collisions occur surely, and
moreover a rigorous upper bound is provided for the expected wait time. The
algorithm is also demonstrated in simulations. The proposed algorithms are
inspired by polling systems. In fact, the problem studied in this paper leads
to a new polling system where customers are subject to differential
constraints, which may be interesting in its own right.

 <dc:description>  Marketplaces specializing in malicious hacking products - including malware
and exploits - have recently become more prominent on the darkweb and deepweb.
We scrape 17 such sites and collect information about such products in a
unified database schema. Using a combination of manual labeling and
unsupervised clustering, we examine a corpus of products in order to understand
their various categories and how they become specialized with respect to vendor
and marketplace. This initial study presents how we effectively employed
unsupervised techniques to this data as well as the types of insights we gained
on various categories of malicious hacking products.

 <dc:description>  Many e-commerce websites use recommender systems or personalized rankers to
personalize search results based on their previous interactions. However, a
large fraction of users has no prior inter-actions, making it impossible to use
collaborative filtering or rely on user history for personalization. Even the
most active users mayvisit only a few times a year and may have volatile needs
or different personas, making their personal history a sparse and noisy signal
at best. This paper investigates how, when we cannot rely on the user history,
the large scale availability of other user interactions still allows us to
build meaningful profiles from the contextual data and whether such contextual
profiles are useful to customize the ranking, exemplified by data from a major
online travel agentBooking.com.Our main findings are threefold: First, we
characterize the Continuous Cold Start Problem(CoCoS) from the viewpoint of
typical e-commerce applications. Second, as explicit situational con-text is
not available in typical real world applications, implicit cues from
transaction logs used at scale can capture essential features of situational
context. Third, contextual user profiles can be created offline, resulting in a
set of smaller models compared to a single huge non-contextual model, making
contextual ranking available with negligible CPU and memory footprint. Finally
we conclude that, in an online A/B test on live users, our contextual ranker
in-creased user engagement substantially over a non-contextual base-line, with
click-through-rate (CTR) increased by 20%. This clearly demonstrates the value
of contextual user profiles in a real world application.

 <dc:description>  We present three results on the complexity of Minimax Approval Voting. First,
we study Minimax Approval Voting parameterized by the Hamming distance $d$ from
the solution to the votes. We show Minimax Approval Voting admits no algorithm
running in time $\mathcal{O}^\star(2^{o(d\log d)})$, unless the Exponential
Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. This means that the $\mathcal{O}^\star(d^{2d})$
algorithm of Misra et al. [AAMAS 2015] is essentially optimal. Motivated by
this, we then show a parameterized approximation scheme, running in time
$\mathcal{O}^\star(\left({3}/{\epsilon}\right)^{2d})$, which is essentially
tight assuming ETH. Finally, we get a new polynomial-time randomized
approximation scheme for Minimax Approval Voting, which runs in time
$n^{\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2 \cdot \log(1/\epsilon))} \cdot \mathrm{poly}(m)$,
almost matching the running time of the fastest known PTAS for Closest String
due to Ma and Sun [SIAM J. Comp. 2009].

 <dc:description>  A simple graph $G=(V,E)$ admits an $H$-covering if every edge in $E$ is
contained in a subgraph $H'=(V',E')$ of $G$ which is isomorphic to $H$. In this
case we say that $G$ is $H$-supermagic if there is a bijection $f:V\cup
E\to\{1,\ldots\lvert V\rvert+\lvert E\rvert\}$ such that
$f(V)=\{1,\ldots,\lvert V\rvert\}$ and $\sum_{v\in V(H')}f(v)+\sum_{e\in

$F_{k,n}$ is $F_{2,n}$-supermagic, the banana tree $B_{k,n}$ is
$B_{1,n}$-supermagic and the flower $F_n$ is $C_3$-supermagic.

 <dc:title>Coded Caching with Low Subpacketization Levels</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Caching is popular technique in content delivery networks that allows for
reductions in transmission rates from the content-hosting server to the end
users. Coded caching is a generalization of conventional caching that considers
the possibility of coding in the caches and transmitting coded signals from the
server. Prior results in this area demonstrate that huge reductions in
transmission rates are possible and this makes coded caching an attractive
option for the next generation of content-delivery networks. However, these
results require that each file hosted in the server be partitioned into a large
number (i.e., the subpacketization level) of non-overlapping subfiles. From a
practical perspective, this is problematic as it means that prior schemes are
only applicable when the size of the files is extremely large. In this work, we
propose a novel coded caching scheme that enjoys a significantly lower
subpacketization level than prior schemes, while only suffering a marginal
increase in the transmission rate. In particular, for a fixed cache size, the
scaling with the number of users is such that the increase in transmission rate
is negligible, but the decrease in subpacketization level is exponential.

 <dc:description>  Modeling of physical human-robot collaborations is generally a challenging
problem due to the unpredictive nature of human behavior. To address this
issue, we present a data-efficient reinforcement learning framework which
enables a robot to learn how to collaborate with a human partner. The robot
learns the task from its own sensorimotor experiences in an unsupervised
manner. The uncertainty of the human actions is modeled using Gaussian
processes (GP) to implement action-value functions. Optimal action selection
given the uncertain GP model is ensured by Bayesian optimization. We apply the
framework to a scenario in which a human and a PR2 robot jointly control the
ball position on a plank based on vision and force/torque data. Our
experimental results show the suitability of the proposed method in terms of
fast and data-efficient model learning, optimal action selection under
uncertainties and equal role sharing between the partners.

 <dc:description>  Data association, the reasoning over correspondence between targets and
measurements, is a problem of fundamental importance in target tracking.
Recently, belief propagation (BP) has emerged as a promising method for
estimating the marginal probabilities of measurement to target association,
providing fast, accurate estimates. The excellent performance of BP in the
particular formulation used may be attributed to the convexity of the
underlying free energy which it implicitly optimises. This paper studies
multiple scan data association problems, i.e., problems that reason over
correspondence between targets and several sets of measurements, which may
correspond to different sensors or different time steps. We find that the
multiple scan extension of the single scan BP formulation is non-convex and
demonstrate the undesirable behaviour that can result. A convex free energy is
constructed using the recently proposed fractional free energy (FFE). A
convergent, BP-like algorithm is provided for the single scan FFE, and employed
in optimising the multiple scan free energy using primal-dual coordinate
ascent. Finally, based on a variational interpretation of joint probabilistic
data association (JPDA), we develop a sequential variant of the algorithm that
is similar to JPDA, but retains consistency constraints from prior scans. The
performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated on a bearings only target
localisation problem.

easily copied and hacked by using special software. To enforce the security of
sending messages through mobile phones, one solution is SMS steganography. SMS
Steganography is a technique that hides a secret message in the SMS. We propose
a new approach for SMS steganography that uses a mathematical equation as the
stego media in order to transmit the data. With this approach, we can hide up
to 35 characters (25%) of a secret message on a single SMS with maximum of 140
characters.

 <dc:description>  Pruhs and Woeginger prove the existence of FPTAS's for a general class of
minimization and maximization subset selection problems. Without losing
generality from the original framework, we prove how better asymptotic
worst-case running times can be achieved if a $\rho$-approximation algorithm is
available, and in particular we obtain matching running times between
maximization and minimization subset selection problems. We directly apply this
result to the Minimum Knapsack Problem, for which the original framework yields
an FPTAS with running time $O(n^5/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ is the required
accuracy and $n$ is the number of items, and obtain an FPTAS with running time
$O(n^3/\epsilon)$, thus improving the running time by a quadratic factor in the
worst case.

 <dc:description>  Due to the lack of structured knowledge applied in learning distributed
representation of cate- gories, existing work cannot incorporate category
hierarchies into entity information. We propose a framework that embeds
entities and categories into a semantic space by integrating structured
knowledge and taxonomy hierarchy from large knowledge bases. The framework
allows to com- pute meaningful semantic relatedness between entities and
categories. Our framework can han- dle both single-word concepts and
multiple-word concepts with superior performance on concept categorization and
yield state of the art results on dataless hierarchical classification.

 <dc:title>On maximizing a monotone k-submodular function subject to a matroid

 <dc:description>  A $k$-submodular function is an extension of a submodular function in that
its input is given by $k$ disjoint subsets instead of a single subset. For
unconstrained nonnegative $k$-submodular maximization, Ward and \v{Z}ivn\'y
proposed a constant-factor approximation algorithm, which was improved by the
recent work of Iwata, Tanigawa and Yoshida presenting a $1/2$-approximation
algorithm. Iwata et al. also provided a $k/(2k-1)$-approximation algorithm for
monotone $k$-submodular maximization and proved that its approximation ratio is
asymptotically tight. More recently, Ohsaka and Yoshida proposed
constant-factor algorithms for monotone $k$-submodular maximization with
several size constraints. However, while submodular maximization with various
constraints has been extensively studied, no approximation algorithm has been
developed for constrained $k$-submodular maximization, except for the case of
size constraints. In this paper, we prove that a greedy algorithm outputs a
$1/2$-approximate solution for monotone $k$-submodular maximization with a
matroid constraint. The algorithm runs in $O(M|E|(\text{MO} + k\text{EO}))$
time, where $M$ is the size of a maximal optimal solution, $|E|$ is the size of
the ground set, and $\text{MO}, \text{EO}$ represent the time for the
membership oracle of the matroid and the evaluation oracle of the
$k$-submodular function, respectively.

 <dc:description>  We describe an application of machine learning to the problem of predicting
preterm birth. We conduct a secondary analysis on a clinical trial dataset
collected by the National In- stitute of Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD) while focusing our attention on predicting different classes of preterm
birth. We compare three approaches for deriving predictive models: a support
vector machine (SVM) approach with linear and non-linear kernels, logistic
regression with different model selection along with a model based on decision
rules prescribed by physician experts for prediction of preterm birth. Our
approach highlights the pre-processing methods applied to handle the inherent
dynamics, noise and gaps in the data and describe techniques used to handle
skewed class distributions. Empirical experiments demonstrate significant
improvement in predicting preterm birth compared to past work.

 <dc:description>  We analyze stability properties of monotone nonlinear systems via
max-separable Lyapunov functions, motivated by the following observations:
first, recent results have shown that asymptotic stability of a monotone
nonlinear system implies the existence of a max-separable Lyapunov function on
a compact set; second, for monotone linear systems, asymptotic stability
implies the stronger properties of D-stability and insensitivity to
time-delays. This paper establishes that for monotone nonlinear systems,
equivalence holds between asymptotic stability, the existence of a
max-separable Lyapunov function, D-stability, and insensitivity to bounded and
unbounded time-varying delays. In particular, a new and general notion of
D-stability for monotone nonlinear systems is discussed and a set of necessary
and sufficient conditions for delay-independent stability are derived. Examples
show how the results extend the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  In the real world datasets (e.g.,DBpedia query log), queries built on
well-designed patterns containing only AND and OPT operators (for short,
WDAO-patterns) account for a large proportion among all SPARQL queries. In this
paper, we present a plugin-based framework for all SELECT queries built on
WDAO-patterns, named PIWD. The framework is based on a parse tree called
\emph{well-designed AND-OPT tree} (for short, WDAO-tree) whose leaves are basic
graph patterns (BGP) and inner nodes are the OPT operators. We prove that for
any WDAO-pattern, its parse tree can be equivalently transformed into a
WDAO-tree. Based on the proposed framework, we can employ any query engine to
evaluate BGP for evaluating queries built on WDAO-patterns in a convenient way.
Theoretically, we can reduce the query evaluation of WDAO-patterns to subgraph
homomorphism as well as BGP since the query evaluation of BGP is equivalent to
subgraph homomorphism. Finally, our preliminary experiments on gStore and
RDF-3X show that PIWD can answer all queries built on WDAO-patterns effectively
and efficiently.

 <dc:description>  Accurately drawing 3D objects is difficult for untrained individuals, as it
requires an understanding of perspective and its effects on geometry and
proportions. Step-by-step tutorials break the complex task of sketching an
entire object down into easy-to-follow steps that even a novice can follow.
However, creating such tutorials requires expert knowledge and is a
time-consuming task. As a result, the availability of tutorials for a given
object or viewpoint is limited. How2Sketch addresses this problem by
automatically generating easy-to-follow tutorials for arbitrary 3D objects.
Given a segmented 3D model and a camera viewpoint,it computes a sequence of
steps for constructing a drawing scaffold comprised of geometric primitives,
which helps the user draw the final contours in correct perspective and
proportion. To make the drawing scaffold easy to construct, the algorithm
solves for an ordering among the scaffolding primitives and explicitly makes
small geometric modifications to the size and location of the object parts to
simplify relative positioning. Technically, we formulate this scaffold
construction as a single selection problem that simultaneously solves for the
ordering and geometric changes of the primitives. We demonstrate our algorithm
for generating tutorials on a variety of man-made objects and evaluate how
easily the tutorials can be followed with a user study.

 <dc:description>  We propose a continuous optimization method for solving dense 3D scene flow
problems from stereo imagery. As in recent work, we represent the dynamic 3D
scene as a collection of rigidly moving planar segments. The scene flow problem
then becomes the joint estimation of pixel-to-segment assignment, 3D position,
normal vector and rigid motion parameters for each segment, leading to a
complex and expensive discrete-continuous optimization problem. In contrast, we
propose a purely continuous formulation which can be solved more efficiently.
Using a fine superpixel segmentation that is fixed a-priori, we propose a
factor graph formulation that decomposes the problem into photometric,
geometric, and smoothing constraints. We initialize the solution with a novel,
high-quality initialization method, then independently refine the geometry and
motion of the scene, and finally perform a global non-linear refinement using
Levenberg-Marquardt. We evaluate our method in the challenging KITTI Scene Flow
benchmark, ranking in third position, while being 3 to 30 times faster than the
top competitors.

 <dc:description>  Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has gained increasing attention as an effective
method to mitigate Parkinsons disease (PD) disorders. Existing DBS systems are
open-loop such that the system parameters are not adjusted automatically based
on patients behavior. Classification of human behavior is an important step in
the design of the next generation of DBS systems that are closed-loop. This
paper presents a classification approach to recognize such behavioral tasks
using the subthalamic nucleus (STN) Local Field Potential (LFP) signals. In our
approach, we use the time-frequency representation (spectrogram) of the raw LFP
signals recorded from left and right STNs as the feature vectors. Then these
features are combined together via Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Multiple
Kernel Learning (MKL) formulation. The MKL-based classification method is
utilized to classify different tasks: button press, mouth movement, speech, and
arm movement. Our experiments show that the lp-norm MKL significantly
outperforms single kernel SVM-based classifiers in classifying behavioral tasks
of five subjects even using signals acquired with a low sampling rate of 10 Hz.
This leads to a lower computational cost.

 <dc:description>  In this work we present a novel approach for single depth map
super-resolution. Modern consumer depth sensors, especially Time-of-Flight
sensors, produce dense depth measurements, but are affected by noise and have a
low lateral resolution. We propose a method that combines the benefits of
recent advances in machine learning based single image super-resolution, i.e.
deep convolutional networks, with a variational method to recover accurate
high-resolution depth maps. In particular, we integrate a variational method
that models the piecewise affine structures apparent in depth data via an
anisotropic total generalized variation regularization term on top of a deep
network. We call our method ATGV-Net and train it end-to-end by unrolling the
optimization procedure of the variational method. To train deep networks, a
large corpus of training data with accurate ground-truth is required. We
demonstrate that it is feasible to train our method solely on synthetic data
that we generate in large quantities for this task. Our evaluations show that
we achieve state-of-the-art results on three different benchmarks, as well as
on a challenging Time-of-Flight dataset, all without utilizing an additional
intensity image as guidance.

 <dc:description>  Fault tolerance for the upcoming exascale generation has long been an area of
active research. One of the components of a fault tolerance strategy is
checkpointing. Petascale-level checkpointing is demonstrated through a new
mechanism for virtualization of the InfiniBand UD (unreliable datagram) mode,
and for updating the remote address on each UD-based send, due to lack of a
fixed peer. Note that InfiniBand UD is required to support modern MPI
implementations. An extrapolation from the current results to future SSD-based
storage systems provides evidence that the current approach will remain
practical in the exascale generation. This transparent checkpointing approach
is evaluated using a framework of the DMTCP checkpointing package. Results are
shown for HPCG (linear algebra), NAMD (molecular dynamics), and the NAS NPB
benchmarks. In tests up to 32,752 MPI processes on 32,752 CPU cores,
checkpointing of a computation with a 38 TB memory footprint in 11 minutes is
demonstrated. Runtime overhead is reduced to less than 1%. The approach is also
evaluated across three widely used MPI implementations.

 <dc:description>  The quick proliferation of LPWAN networks, being LoRaWAN one of the most
adopted, raised the interest of the industry, network operators and facilitated
the development of novel services based on large scale and simple network
structures. LoRaWAN brings the desired ubiquitous connectivity to enable most
of the outdoor IoT applications and its growth and quick adoption are real
proofs of that. Yet the technology has some limitations that need to be
understood in order to avoid over-use of the technology. In this article we aim
to provide an impartial overview of what are the limitations of such
technology, and in a comprehensive manner bring use case examples to show where
the limits are.

 <dc:description>  Learning of low-rank matrices is fundamental to many machine learning
applications. A state-of-the-art algorithm is the rank-one matrix pursuit
(R1MP). However, it can only be used in matrix completion problems with the
square loss. In this paper, we develop a more flexible greedy algorithm for
generalized low-rank models whose optimization objective can be smooth or
nonsmooth, general convex or strongly convex. The proposed algorithm has low
per-iteration time complexity and fast convergence rate. Experimental results
show that it is much faster than the state-of-the-art, with comparable or even
better prediction performance.

 <dc:description>  It this paper we revisit the fast stylization method introduced in Ulyanov
et. al. (2016). We show how a small change in the stylization architecture
results in a significant qualitative improvement in the generated images. The
change is limited to swapping batch normalization with instance normalization,
and to apply the latter both at training and testing times. The resulting
method can be used to train high-performance architectures for real-time image
generation. The code will is made available on github at

 <dc:description>  Consider statistical learning (e.g. discrete distribution estimation) with
local $\epsilon$-differential privacy, which preserves each data provider's
privacy locally, we aim to optimize statistical data utility under the privacy
constraints. Specifically, we study maximizing mutual information between a
provider's data and its private view, and give the exact mutual information
bound along with an attainable mechanism: $k$-subset mechanism as results. The
mutual information optimal mechanism randomly outputs a size $k$ subset of the
original data domain with delicate probability assignment, where $k$ varies
with the privacy level $\epsilon$ and the data domain size $d$. After analysing
the limitations of existing local private mechanisms from mutual information
perspective, we propose an efficient implementation of the $k$-subset mechanism
for discrete distribution estimation, and show its optimality guarantees over
existing approaches.

 <dc:description>  3GPP LWIP Release 13 technology and its prestandard version Wi-Fi Boost have
recently emerged as an efficient LTE and Wi-Fi integration at the IP layer,
allowing uplink on LTE and downlink on Wi-Fi. This solves all the contention
problems of Wi-Fi and allows an optimum usage of the unlicensed band for
downlink. In this paper, we present a new feature of Wi-Fi Boost, its radio
link management, which allows to steer the downlink traffic between both LTE
and Wi-Fi upon congestion detection in an intelligent manner. This customised
congestion detection algorithm is based on IP probing, and can work with any
Wi-Fi access point. Simulation results in a typical enterprise scenario show
that LWIP R13 and Wi-Fi Boost can enhance network performance up to 5x and 6x
over LTE-only, and 4x and 5x over Wi-Fi only networks, respectively, and that
the the proposed radio link management can further improve Wi-Fi Boost
performance over LWIP R13 up to 19 %. Based on the promising results, this
paper suggests to enhance LWIP R13 user feedback in future LTE releases.

 <dc:description>  Symbolic Computation and Satisfiability Checking are two research areas, both
having their individual scientific focus but sharing also common interests in
the development, implementation and application of decision procedures for
arithmetic theories. Despite their commonalities, the two communities are
rather weakly connected. The aim of our newly accepted SC-square project
(H2020-FETOPEN-CSA) is to strengthen the connection between these communities
by creating common platforms, initiating interaction and exchange, identifying
common challenges, and developing a common roadmap from theory along the way to
tools and (industrial) applications. In this paper we report on the aims and on
the first activities of this project, and formalise some relevant challenges
for the unified SC-square community.

 <dc:title>Behavior and path planning for the coalition of cognitive robots in

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we outline the approach of solving special type of navigation
tasks for robotic systems, when a coalition of robots (agents) acts in the 2D
environment, which can be modified by the actions, and share the same goal
location. The latter is originally unreachable for some members of the
coalition, but the common task still can be accomplished as the agents can
assist each other (e.g. by modifying the environment). We call such tasks smart
relocation tasks (as the can not be solved by pure path planning methods) and
study spatial and behavior interaction of robots while solving them. We use
cognitive approach and introduce semiotic knowledge representation - sign world
model which underlines behavioral planning methodology. Planning is viewed as a
recursive search process in the hierarchical state-space induced by sings with
path planning signs reside on the lowest level. Reaching this level triggers
path planning which is accomplished by state of the art grid-based planners
focused on producing smooth paths (e.g. LIAN) and thus indirectly guarantying
feasibility of that paths against agent's dynamic constraints.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a robust tracking method based on the collaboration
of a generative model and a discriminative classifier, where features are
learned by shallow and deep architectures, respectively. For the generative
model, we introduce a block-based incremental learning scheme, in which a local
binary mask is constructed to deal with occlusion. The similarity degrees
between the local patches and their corresponding subspace are integrated to
formulate a more accurate global appearance model. In the discriminative model,
we exploit the advances of deep learning architectures to learn generic
features which are robust to both background clutters and foreground appearance
variations. To this end, we first construct a discriminative training set from
auxiliary video sequences. A deep classification neural network is then trained
offline on this training set. Through online fine-tuning, both the hierarchical
feature extractor and the classifier can be adapted to the appearance change of
the target for effective online tracking. The collaboration of these two models
achieves a good balance in handling occlusion and target appearance change,
which are two contradictory challenging factors in visual tracking. Both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations against several state-of-the-art
algorithms on challenging image sequences demonstrate the accuracy and the
robustness of the proposed tracker.

 <dc:title>Minmax Tree Facility Location and Sink Evacuation with Dynamic Confluent

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph modelling a building or road network in which edges
have-both travel times (lengths) and capacities associated with them. An edge's
capacity is the number of people that can enter that edge in a unit of time.
  In emergencies, people evacuate towards the exits. If too many people try to
evacuate through the same edge, congestion builds up and slows down the
evacuation.
  Graphs with both lengths and capacities are known as Dynamic Flow networks.
An evacuation plan for $G$ consists of a choice of exit locations and a
partition of the people at the vertices into groups, with each group evacuating
to the same exit. The evacuation time of a plan is the time it takes until the
last person evacuates. The $k$-sink evacuation problem is to provide an
evacuation plan with $k$ exit locations that minimizes the evacuation time. It
is known that this problem is NP-Hard for general graphs but no polynomial time
algorithm was previously known even for the case of $G$ a tree. This paper
presents an $O(n k^2 \log^5 n)$ algorithm for the $k$-sink evacuation problem
on trees. Our algorithms also apply to a more general class of problems, which
we call minmax tree facility location.

 <dc:description>  The cop number of a graph $G$ is the smallest $k$ such that $k$ cops win the
game of cops and robber on $G$. We investigate the maximum cop number of
geometric intersection graphs, which are graphs whose vertices are represented
by geometric shapes and edges by their intersections. We establish the
following dichotomy for previously studied classes of intersection graphs:
  The intersection graphs of arc-connected sets in the plane (called string
graphs) have cop number at most 15, and more generally, the intersection graphs
of arc-connected subsets of a surface have cop number at most $10g+15$ in case
of orientable surface of genus $g$, and at most $10g'+15$ in case of
non-orientable surface of Euler genus $g'$. For more restricted classes of
intersection graphs, we obtain better bounds: the maximum cop number of
interval filament graphs is two, and the maximum cop number of outer-string
graphs is between 3 and 4.
  The intersection graphs of disconnected 2-dimensional sets or of
3-dimensional sets have unbounded cop number even in very restricted settings.
For instance, we show that the cop number is unbounded on intersection graphs
of two-element subsets of a line, as well as on intersection graphs of
3-dimensional unit balls, of 3-dimensional unit cubes or of 3-dimensional
axis-aligned unit segments.

 <dc:description>  Learning based approaches have not yet achieved their full potential in
optical flow estimation, where their performance still trails heuristic
approaches. In this paper, we present a CNN based patch matching approach for
optical flow estimation. An important contribution of our approach is a novel
thresholded loss for Siamese networks. We demonstrate that our loss performs
clearly better than existing losses. It also allows to speed up training by a
factor of 2 in our tests. Furthermore, we present a novel way for calculating
CNN based features for different image scales, which performs better than
existing methods. We also discuss new ways of evaluating the robustness of
trained features for the application of patch matching for optical flow. An
interesting discovery in our paper is that low-pass filtering of feature maps
can increase the robustness of features created by CNNs. We proved the
competitive performance of our approach by submitting it to the KITTI 2012,
KITTI 2015 and MPI-Sintel evaluation portals where we obtained state-of-the-art
results on all three datasets.

 <dc:description>  Let $F$ be a connected graph with $\ell$ vertices. The existence of a
subgraph isomorphic to $F$ can be defined in first-order logic with quantifier
depth no better than $\ell$, simply because no first-order formula of smaller
quantifier depth can distinguish between the complete graphs $K_\ell$ and
$K_{\ell-1}$. We show that, for some $F$, the existence of an $F$ subgraph in
\emph{sufficiently large} connected graphs is definable with quantifier depth
$\ell-3$. On the other hand, this is never possible with quantifier depth
better than $\ell/2$. If we, however, consider definitions over connected
graphs with sufficiently large treewidth, the quantifier depth can for some $F$
be arbitrarily small comparing to $\ell$ but never smaller than the treewidth
of $F$. Moreover, the definitions over highly connected graphs require
quantifier depth strictly more than the density of $F$. Finally, we determine
the exact values of these descriptive complexity parameters for all connected
pattern graphs $F$ on 4 vertices.

 <dc:description>  In the medical domain, the continuous stream of scientific research contains
contradictory results supported by arguments and counter-arguments. As medical
expertise occurs at different levels, part of the human agents have
difficulties to face the huge amount of studies, but also to understand the
reasons and pieces of evidences claimed by the proponents and the opponents of
the debated topic. To better understand the supporting arguments for new
findings related to current state of the art in the medical domain we need
tools able to identify arguments in scientific papers. Our work here aims to
fill the above technological gap.
  Quite aware of the difficulty of this task, we embark to this road by relying
on the well-known interleaving of domain knowledge with natural language
processing. To formalise the existing medical knowledge, we rely on ontologies.
To structure the argumentation model we use also the expressivity and reasoning
capabilities of Description Logics. To perform argumentation mining we
formalise various linguistic patterns in a rule-based language. We tested our
solution against a corpus of scientific papers related to breast cancer. The
run experiments show a F-measure between 0.71 and 0.86 for identifying
conclusions of an argument and between 0.65 and 0.86 for identifying premises
of an argument.

 <dc:title>Harmonization of conflicting medical opinions using argumentation

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease,
affecting more than 1.2 million people in Europe. Medications are available for
the management of its symptoms, but the exact cause of the disease is unknown
and there is currently no cure on the market. To better understand the
relations between new findings and current medical knowledge, we need tools
able to analyse published medical papers based on natural language processing
and tools capable to identify various relationships of new findings with the
current medical knowledge. Our work aims to fill the above technological gap.
  To identify conflicting information in medical documents, we enact textual
entailment technology. To encapsulate existing medical knowledge, we rely on
ontologies. To connect the formal axioms in ontologies with natural text in
medical articles, we exploit ontology verbalisation techniques. To assess the
level of disagreement between human agents with respect to a medical issue, we
rely on fuzzy aggregation. To harmonize this disagreement, we design mediation
protocols within a multi-agent framework.

 <dc:description>  Algorithmic statistics has two different (and almost orthogonal) motivations.
From the philosophical point of view, it tries to formalize how the statistics
works and why some statistical models are better than others. After this notion
of a &quot;good model&quot; is introduced, a natural question arises: it is possible that
for some piece of data there is no good model? If yes, how often these bad
(&quot;non-stochastic&quot;) data appear &quot;in real life&quot;?
  Another, more technical motivation comes from algorithmic information theory.
In this theory a notion of complexity of a finite object (=amount of
information in this object) is introduced; it assigns to every object some
number, called its algorithmic complexity (or Kolmogorov complexity).
Algorithmic statistic provides a more fine-grained classification: for each
finite object some curve is defined that characterizes its behavior. It turns
out that several different definitions give (approximately) the same curve.
  In this survey we try to provide an exposition of the main results in the
field (including full proofs for the most important ones), as well as some
historical comments. We assume that the reader is familiar with the main
notions of algorithmic information (Kolmogorov complexity) theory.

 <dc:description>  The theory of computer science is based around Universal Turing Machines
(UTMs): abstract machines able to execute all possible algorithms. Modern
digital computers are physical embodiments of UTMs. The nondeterministic
polynomial (NP) time complexity class of problems is the most significant in
computer science, and an efficient (i.e. polynomial P) way to solve such
problems would be of profound economic and social importance. By definition
nondeterministic UTMs (NUTMs) solve NP complete problems in P time. However,
NUTMs have previously been believed to be physically impossible to construct.
Thue string rewriting systems are computationally equivalent to UTMs, and are
naturally nondeterministic. Here we describe the physical design for a NUTM
that implements a universal Thue system. The design exploits the ability of DNA
to replicate to execute an exponential number of computational paths in P time.
Each Thue rewriting step is embodied in a DNA edit implemented using a novel
combination of polymerase chain reactions and site-directed mutagenesis. We
demonstrate that this design works using both computational modelling and in
vitro molecular biology experimentation. The current design has limitations,
such as restricted error-correction. However, it opens up the prospect of
engineering NUTM based computers able to outperform all standard computers on
important practical problems.

 <dc:description>  The conservation laws of continuum mechanic written in an Eulerian frame make
no difference between fluids and solids except in the expression of the stress
tensors, usually with Newton's hypothesis for the fluids and Helmholtz
potentials of energy for hyperelastic solids. By taking the velocities as
unknown , monolithic methods for fluid structure interactions (FSI) are built.
In this article such a formulation is analyzed when the fluid is compressible
and the fluid is incompressible. The idea is not new but the progress of mesh
generators and numerical schemes like the Characteristics-Galerkin method
render this approach feasible and reasonably robust. In this article the method
and its discretization are presented, stability is discussed by through an
energy estimate. A numerical section discusses implementation issues and
presents a few simple tests.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the task of zero-shot image classification. The key
contribution of the proposed approach is to control the semantic embedding of
images -- one of the main ingredients of zero-shot learning -- by formulating
it as a metric learning problem. The optimized empirical criterion associates
two types of sub-task constraints: metric discriminating capacity and accurate
attribute prediction. This results in a novel expression of zero-shot learning
not requiring the notion of class in the training phase: only pairs of
image/attributes, augmented with a consistency indicator, are given as ground
truth. At test time, the learned model can predict the consistency of a test
image with a given set of attributes , allowing flexible ways to produce
recognition inferences. Despite its simplicity, the proposed approach gives
state-of-the-art results on four challenging datasets used for zero-shot
recognition evaluation.

 <dc:description>  As capacity and complexity of on-chip cache memory hierarchy increases, the
service cost to the critical loads from Last Level Cache (LLC), which are
frequently repeated, has become a major concern. The processor may stall for a
considerable interval while waiting to access the data stored in the cache
blocks in LLC, if there are no independent instructions to execute. To provide
accelerated service to the critical loads requests from LLC, this work
concentrates on leveraging the additional capacity offered by replacing
SRAM-based L2 with Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM) to
accommodate frequently accessed cache blocks in exclusive read mode in favor of
reducing the overall read service time. Our proposed technique partitions L2
cache into two STT-RAM arrangements with different write performance and data
retention time. The retention-relaxed STT-RAM arrays are utilized to
effectively deal with the regular L2 cache requests while the high retention
STT-RAM arrays in L2 are selected for maintaining repeatedly read accessed
cache blocks from LLC by incurring negligible energy consumption for data
retention. Our experimental results show that the proposed technique can reduce
the mean L2 read miss ratio by 51.4% and increase the IPC by 11.7% on average
across PARSEC benchmark suite while significantly decreasing the total L2
energy consumption compared to conventional SRAM-based L2 design.

 <dc:description>  The battle to mitigate Android malware has become more critical with the
emergence of new strains incorporating increasingly sophisticated evasion
techniques, in turn necessitating more advanced detection capabilities. Hence,
in this paper we propose and evaluate a machine learning based approach based
on eigenspace analysis for Android malware detection using features derived
from static analysis characterization of Android applications. Empirical
evaluation with a dataset of real malware and benign samples show that
detection rate of over 96% with a very low false positive rate is achievable
using the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  We present a method for humanoid robot walking on partial footholds such as
small stepping stones and rocks with sharp surfaces. Our algorithm does not
rely on prior knowledge of the foothold, but information about an expected
foothold can be used to improve the stepping performance. After a step is
taken, the robot explores the new contact surface by attempting to shift the
center of pressure around the foot. The available foothold is inferred by the
way in which the foot rotates about contact edges and/or by the achieved center
of pressure locations on the foot during exploration. This estimated contact
area is then used by a whole body momentum-based control algorithm. To walk and
balance on partial footholds, we combine fast, dynamic stepping with the use of
upper body angular momentum to regain balance. We applied this method to the
Atlas humanoid designed by Boston Dynamics to walk over small contact surfaces,
such as line and point contacts. We present experimental results and discuss
performance limitations.

 <dc:title>&quot;Open Innovation&quot; and &quot;Triple Helix&quot; Models of Innovation: Can Synergy

 <dc:description>  The model of &quot;Open Innovations&quot; (OI) can be compared with the &quot;Triple Helix
of University-Industry-Government Relations&quot; (TH) as attempts to find surplus
value in bringing industrial innovation closer to public R&amp;D. Whereas the firm
is central in the model of OI, the TH adds multi-centeredness: in addition to
firms, universities and (e.g., regional) governments can take leading roles in
innovation eco-systems. In addition to the (transversal) technology transfer at
each moment of time, one can focus on the dynamics in the feedback loops. Under
specifiable conditions, feedback loops can be turned into feedforward ones that
drive innovation eco-systems towards self-organization and the auto-catalytic
generation of new options. The generation of options can be more important than
historical realizations (&quot;best practices&quot;) for the longer-term viability of
knowledge-based innovation systems. A system without sufficient options, for
example, is locked-in. The generation of redundancy -- the Triple Helix
indicator -- can be used as a measure of unrealized but technologically
feasible options given a historical configuration. Different coordination
mechanisms (markets, policies, knowledge) provide different perspectives on the
same information and thus generate redundancy. Increased redundancy not only
stimulates innovation in an eco-system by reducing the prevailing uncertainty;
it also enhances the synergy in and innovativeness of an innovation system.

 <dc:description>  One of the most difficult problems in the development of intelligent systems
is the construction of the underlying knowledge base. As a consequence, the
rate of progress in the development of this type of system is directly related
to the speed with which knowledge bases can be assembled, and on its quality.
We attempt to solve the knowledge acquisition problem, for a Business
Information System, developing a supervised multistrategy learning paradigm.
This paradigm is centred on a collaborative data mining strategy, where groups
of experts collaborate using data-mining process on the supervised acquisition
of new knowledge extracted from heterogeneous machine learning data models.
  The Actias system is our approach to this paradigm. It is the result of
applying the graphic logic based language of sketches to knowledge integration.
The system is a data mining collaborative workplace, where the Information
System knowledge base is an algebraic structure. It results from the
integration of background knowledge with new insights extracted from data
models, generated for specific data modelling tasks, and represented as rules
using the sketches language.

 <dc:description>  A recent research trend in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the combination of
several programs into one single, stronger, program; this is termed portfolio
methods. We here investigate the application of such methods to Game Playing
Programs (GPPs). In addition, we consider the case in which only one GPP is
available - by decomposing this single GPP into several ones through the use of
parameters or even simply random seeds. These portfolio methods are trained in
a learning phase. We propose two different offline approaches. The simplest
one, BestArm, is a straightforward optimization of seeds or parame- ters; it
performs quite well against the original GPP, but performs poorly against an
opponent which repeats games and learns. The second one, namely Nash-portfolio,
performs similarly in a &quot;one game&quot; test, and is much more robust against an
opponent who learns. We also propose an online learning portfolio, which tests
several of the GPP repeatedly and progressively switches to the best one -
using a bandit algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In order to protect user privacy on mobile devices, an event-driven implicit
authentication scheme is proposed in this paper. Several methods of utilizing
the scheme for recognizing legitimate user behavior are investigated. The
investigated methods compute an aggregate score and a threshold in real-time to
determine the trust level of the current user using real data derived from user
interaction with the device. The proposed scheme is designed to: operate
completely in the background, require minimal training period, enable high user
recognition rate for implicit authentication, and prompt detection of abnormal
activity that can be used to trigger explicitly authenticated access control.
In this paper, we investigate threshold computation through standard deviation
and EWMA (exponentially weighted moving average) based algorithms. The result
of extensive experiments on user data collected over a period of several weeks
from an Android phone indicates that our proposed approach is feasible and
effective for lightweight real-time implicit authentication on mobile
smartphones.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we provide a performance analysis framework for wireless
industrial networks by deriving a service curve and a bound on the delay
violation probability. For this purpose we use the (min,x) stochastic network
calculus as well as a recently presented recursive formula for an end-to-end
delay bound of wireless heterogeneous networks. The derived results are mapped
to WirelessHART networks used in process automation and were validated via
simulations. In addition to WirelessHART, our results can be applied to any
wireless network whose physical layer conforms the IEEE 802.15.4 standard,
while its MAC protocol incorporates TDMA and channel hopping, like e.g.
ISA100.11a or TSCH-based networks. The provided delay analysis is especially
useful during the network design phase, offering further research potential
towards optimal routing and power management in QoS-constrained wireless
industrial networks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a statistically optimal solution to the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) problem is presented. Many solutions to the PnP problem are geometrically
optimal, but do not consider the uncertainties of the observations. In
addition, it would be desirable to have an internal estimation of the accuracy
of the estimated rotation and translation parameters of the camera pose. Thus,
we propose a novel maximum likelihood solution to the PnP problem, that
incorporates image observation uncertainties and remains real-time capable at
the same time. Further, the presented method is general, as is works with 3D
direction vectors instead of 2D image points and is thus able to cope with
arbitrary central camera models. This is achieved by projecting (and thus
reducing) the covariance matrices of the observations to the corresponding
vector tangent space.

 <dc:description>  Pairwise comparison matrix as a crucial component of AHP, presents the
prefer- ence relations among alternatives. However, in many cases, the pairwise
comparison matrix is difficult to complete, which obstructs the subsequent
operations of the clas- sical AHP. In this paper, based on DEMATEL which has
ability to derive the total relation matrix from direct relation matrix, a new
completion method for incomplete pairwise comparison matrix is proposed. The
proposed method provides a new per- spective to estimate the missing values
with explicit physical meaning. Besides, the proposed method has low
computational cost. This promising method has a wide application in
multi-criteria decision-making.

 <dc:description>  We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for admissible transformations
in the projectivised dual quaternion model of rigid body displacements and we
characterise constraint varieties of dyads with revolute and prismatic joints
in this model. Projective transformations induced by coordinate changes in
moving and/or fixed frame fix the quadrics of a pencil and preserve the two
families of rulings of an exceptional three-dimensional quadric. The constraint
variety of a dyad with two revolute joints is a regular ruled quadric in a
three-space that contains a &quot;null quadrilateral&quot;. If a revolute joint is
replaced by a prismatic joint, this quadrilateral collapses into a pair of
conjugate complex null lines and a real line but these properties are not
sufficient to characterise such dyads. We provide a complete characterisation
by introducing a new invariant, the &quot;fiber projectivity&quot;, and we present
examples that demonstrate its potential to explain hitherto not sufficiently
well understood phenomena.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the design and implementation of a measurement-based QoS
and resource management framework, CNQF (Converged Networks QoS Management
Framework). CNQF is designed to provide unified, scalable QoS control and
resource management through the use of a policy-based network management
paradigm. It achieves this via distributed functional entities that are
deployed to co-ordinate the resources of the transport network through
centralized policy-driven decisions supported by measurement-based control
architecture. We present the CNQF architecture, implementation of the prototype
and validation of various inbuilt QoS control mechanisms using real traffic
flows on a Linux-based experimental test bed.

 <dc:description>  The Internet has provided us with great opportunities for large scale
collaborative public good projects. Wikipedia is a predominant example of such
projects where conflicts emerge and get resolved through bottom-up mechanisms
leading to the emergence of the largest encyclopedia in human history.
Disaccord arises whenever editors with different opinions try to produce an
article reflecting a consensual view. The debates are mainly heated by editors
with extremist views. Using a model of common value production, we show that
the consensus can only be reached if extremist groups can actively take part in
the discussion and if their views are also represented in the common outcome,
at least temporarily. We show that banning problematic editors mostly hinders
the consensus as it delays discussion and thus the whole consensus building
process. To validate the model, relevant quantities are measured both in
simulations and Wikipedia which show satisfactory agreement. We also consider
the role of direct communication between editors both in the model and in
Wikipedia data (by analysing the Wikipedia {\it talk} pages). While the model
suggests that in certain conditions there is an optimal rate of &quot;talking&quot; vs
&quot;editing&quot;, it correctly predicts that in the current settings of Wikipedia,
more activity in talk pages is associated with more controversy.

 <dc:description>  We describe the first method to automatically estimate the 3D pose of the
human body as well as its 3D shape from a single unconstrained image. We
estimate a full 3D mesh and show that 2D joints alone carry a surprising amount
of information about body shape. The problem is challenging because of the
complexity of the human body, articulation, occlusion, clothing, lighting, and
the inherent ambiguity in inferring 3D from 2D. To solve this, we first use a
recently published CNN-based method, DeepCut, to predict (bottom-up) the 2D
body joint locations. We then fit (top-down) a recently published statistical
body shape model, called SMPL, to the 2D joints. We do so by minimizing an
objective function that penalizes the error between the projected 3D model
joints and detected 2D joints. Because SMPL captures correlations in human
shape across the population, we are able to robustly fit it to very little
data. We further leverage the 3D model to prevent solutions that cause
interpenetration. We evaluate our method, SMPLify, on the Leeds Sports,
HumanEva, and Human3.6M datasets, showing superior pose accuracy with respect
to the state of the art.

 <dc:description>  Photolethysmographic imaging (PPGI) is a widefield non-contact biophotonic
technology able to remotely monitor cardiovascular function over anatomical
areas. Though spatial context can provide increased physiological insight,
existing PPGI systems rely on coarse spatial averaging with no anatomical
priors for assessing arterial pulsatility. Here, we developed a continuous
probabilistic pulsatility model for importance-weighted blood pulse waveform
extraction. Using a data-driven approach, the model was constructed using a 23
participant sample with large demographic variation (11/12 female/male, age
11-60 years, BMI 16.4-35.1 kg$\cdot$m$^{-2}$). Using time-synchronized
ground-truth waveforms, spatial correlation priors were computed and projected
into a co-aligned importance-weighted Cartesian space. A modified
Parzen-Rosenblatt kernel density estimation method was used to compute the
continuous resolution-agnostic probabilistic pulsatility model. The model
identified locations that consistently exhibited pulsatility across the sample.
Blood pulse waveform signals extracted with the model exhibited significantly
stronger temporal correlation ($W=35,p&lt;0.01$) and spectral SNR ($W=31,p&lt;0.01$)
compared to uniform spatial averaging. Heart rate estimation was in strong
agreement with true heart rate ($r^2=0.9619$, error $(\mu,\sigma)=(0.52,1.69)$
bpm).

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present the next step in our approach to neurobiologically
plausible implementation of emotional reactions and behaviors for real-time
autonomous robotic systems. The working metaphor we use is the &quot;day&quot; and the
&quot;night&quot; phases of mammalian life. During the &quot;day phase&quot; a robotic system
stores the inbound information and is controlled by a light-weight rule-based
system in real time. In contrast to that, during the &quot;night phase&quot; information
that has been stored is transferred to a supercomputing system to update the
realistic neural network: emotional and behavioral strategies.

 <dc:description>  WiFi's popularity has led to crowded scenarios composed of many Access Points
(AP) and clients, often operating on overlapping channels, producing
interference that gravely degrades performance. This misallocation of resources
is often the result of multiple WLANs ownership, that is, networks are
frequently setup automatically without considering neighbouring APs. In this
work we overview the effect of Overlapping BSS (OBSS) from the perspective of
the MAC layer, taking special interest on describing the advantages of
eliminating collisions with Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Enhanced
Collision Avoidance (CSMA/ECA). We propose a single Access Point (AP) and
several multi-AP scenarios, including the residential building example proposed
for testing the upcoming IEEE 802.11ax amendment. Results using the first NS-3
implementation of CSMA/ECA reveal the advantage of CSMA/ECA's deterministic
backoff contention technique, confirming its suitability for very crowded
scenarios.

 <dc:title>Inducing and Mitigating a Self-Reinforcing Degradation in

 <dc:description>  The models in this paper demonstrate how self-reinforcing error due to
positive feedback can lead to overload and saturation of decision-making
elements, and ultimately the cascading collapse of an organization due to the
propagation of overload and erroneous decisions throughout the organization. We
begin the paper with an analysis of the stability of the decision-making
aspects of command organizations from a system-theoretic perspective. A simple
dynamic model shows how an organization can enter into a self-reinforcing cycle
of increasing decision workload until the demand for decisions exceeds the
decision-making capacity of the organization. We then extend the model to more
complex networked organizations and show that they also experience a form of
self-reinforcing degradation. In particular, we find that the degradation in
decision quality has a tendency to propagate through the hierarchical
structure, i.e. overload at one location affects other locations by overloading
the higher-level components which then in turn overload their subordinates. Our
computational experiments suggest several strategies for mitigating this type
of malfunction: dumping excessive load, empowering lower echelons, minimizing
the need for coordination, using command-by-negation, insulating weak
performers, and applying on-line diagnostics. We describe a method to allocate
decision responsibility and arrange information flow dynamically within a team
of decision-makers for command and control.

 <dc:description>  Malware detection is a growing problem particularly on the Android mobile
platform due to its increasing popularity and accessibility to numerous third
party app markets. This has also been made worse by the increasingly
sophisticated detection avoidance techniques employed by emerging malware
families. This calls for more effective techniques for detection and
classification of Android malware. Hence, in this paper we present an n-opcode
analysis based approach that utilizes machine learning to classify and
categorize Android malware. This approach enables automated feature discovery
that eliminates the need for applying expert or domain knowledge to define the
needed features. Our experiments on 2520 samples that were performed using up
to 10-gram opcode features showed that an f-measure of 98% is achievable using
this approach.

 <dc:description>  Identifying measurable genetic indicators (or biomarkers) of a specific
condition of a biological system is a key element of precision medicine. Indeed
it allows to tailor diagnostic, prognostic and treatment choice to individual
characteristics of a patient. In machine learning terms, biomarker discovery
can be framed as a feature selection problem on whole-genome data sets.
However, classical feature selection methods are usually underpowered to
process these data sets, which contain orders of magnitude more features than
samples. This can be addressed by making the assumption that genetic features
that are linked on a biological network are more likely to work jointly towards
explaining the phenotype of interest. We review here three families of methods
for feature selection that integrate prior knowledge in the form of networks.

 <dc:description>  Android is becoming ubiquitous and currently has the largest share of the
mobile OS market with billions of application downloads from the official app
market. It has also become the platform most targeted by mobile malware that
are becoming more sophisticated to evade state-of-the-art detection approaches.
Many Android malware families employ obfuscation techniques in order to avoid
detection and this may defeat static analysis based approaches. Dynamic
analysis on the other hand may be used to overcome this limitation. Hence in
this paper we propose DynaLog, a dynamic analysis based framework for
characterizing Android applications. The framework provides the capability to
analyse the behaviour of applications based on an extensive number of dynamic
features. It provides an automated platform for mass analysis and
characterization of apps that is useful for quickly identifying and isolating
malicious applications. The DynaLog framework leverages existing open source
tools to extract and log high level behaviours, API calls, and critical events
that can be used to explore the characteristics of an application, thus
providing an extensible dynamic analysis platform for detecting Android
malware. DynaLog is evaluated using real malware samples and clean applications
demonstrating its capabilities for effective analysis and detection of
malicious applications.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Versus Non-Adaptive Strategies in the Quantum Setting with

 <dc:description>  We prove a general relation between adaptive and non-adaptive strategies in
the quantum setting, i.e., between strategies where the adversary can or cannot
adaptively base its action on some auxiliary quantum side information. Our
relation holds in a very general setting, and is applicable as long as we can
control the bit-size of the side information, or, more generally, its
&quot;information content&quot;. Since adaptivity is notoriously difficult to handle in
the analysis of (quantum) cryptographic protocols, this gives us a very
powerful tool: as long as we have enough control over the side information, it
is sufficient to restrict ourselves to non-adaptive attacks.
  We demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology with two examples. The
first is a quantum bit commitment scheme based on 1-bit cut-and-choose. Since
bit commitment implies oblivious transfer (in the quantum setting), and
oblivious transfer is universal for two-party computation, this implies the
universality of 1-bit cut-and-choose, and thus solves the main open problem of
[FKSZZ13]. The second example is a quantum bit commitment scheme proposed in
1993 by Brassard et al. It was originally suggested as an unconditionally
secure scheme, back when this was thought to be possible. We partly restore the
scheme by proving it secure in (a variant of) the bounded quantum storage
model.
  In both examples, the fact that the adversary holds quantum side information
obstructs a direct analysis of the scheme, and we circumvent it by analyzing a
non-adaptive version, which can be done by means of known techniques, and
applying our main result.

we show that $(i)$ how we search for the right interval boundary impacts
significantly the overall search speed, $(ii)$ a B-tree data layout easily wins
over the standard one, $(iii)$ the well-known idea of a lookup table for the
prefixes of the suffixes can be refined with using compression, $(iv)$ caching

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Behavior planning is known to be one of the basic cognitive functions, which
is essential for any cognitive architecture of any control system used in
robotics. At the same time most of the widespread planning algorithms employed
in those systems are developed using only approaches and models of Artificial
Intelligence and don't take into account numerous results of cognitive
experiments. As a result, there is a strong need for novel methods of behavior
planning suitable for modern cognitive architectures aimed at robot control.
One such method is presented in this work and is studied within a special class
of navigation task called smart relocation task. The method is based on the
hierarchical two-level model of abstraction and knowledge representation, e.g.
symbolic and subsymbolic. On the symbolic level sign world model is used for
knowledge representation and hierarchical planning algorithm, PMA, is utilized
for planning. On the subsymbolic level the task of path planning is considered
and solved as a graph search problem. Interaction between both planners is
examined and inter-level interfaces and feedback loops are described.
Preliminary experimental results are presented.

 <dc:description>  Power grids normally operate at some stable operating condition where power
supply and demand are balanced. In response to emergency situations, load
shedding is a prevailing approach where local protective devices are activated
to cut a suitable amount of load to quickly rebalance the supply demand and
hopefully stabilize the system. This traditional emergency control results in
interrupted service with severe economic damage to customers. Also, such
control is usually less effective due to the lack of coordination among
protective devices. In this paper, we propose a novel structural emergency
control to render post-fault dynamics from the critical/emergency fault-cleared
state to the stable equilibrium point. This is a new control paradigm that does
not rely on any continuous measurement or load shedding, as in the classical
setup. Instead, the grid is made stable by discretely relocating the
equilibrium point and its stability region such that the system is
consecutively attracted from the fault-cleared state back to the original
equilibrium point. The proposed control is designed by solving linear and
convex optimization problems, making it possibly scalable to large-scale power
grids. Finally, this emergency control scheme can be implemented by exploiting
transmission facilities available on the existing grids.

 <dc:description>  Mobile malware has continued to grow at an alarming rate despite on-going
efforts towards mitigating the problem. This has been particularly noticeable
on Android due to its being an open platform that has subsequently overtaken
other platforms in the share of the mobile smart devices market. Hence,
incentivizing a new wave of emerging Android malware sophisticated enough to
evade most common detection methods. This paper proposes and investigates a
parallel machine learning based classification approach for early detection of
Android malware. Using real malware samples and benign applications, a
composite classification model is developed from parallel combination of
heterogeneous classifiers. The empirical evaluation of the model under
different combination schemes demonstrates its efficacy and potential to
improve detection accuracy. More importantly, by utilizing several classifiers
with diverse characteristics, their strengths can be harnessed not only for
enhanced Android malware detection but also quicker white box analysis by means
of the more interpretable constituent classifiers.

by minimizing a global objective function. Here we present a novel online
algorithm for segmentation and summary, based on point density along the
trajectory, and based on the nature of the naturally occurring structure of
intermittent bouts of locomotive and local activity. We show an application to
visualization of trajectory datasets, and discuss the use of the summary as an
index allowing efficient queries which are otherwise impossible or
computationally expensive, over very large datasets.

 <dc:title>Counting matchings with k unmatched vertices in planar graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Curticapean, Radu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of counting matchings in planar graphs. While perfect
matchings in planar graphs can be counted by a classical polynomial-time
algorithm, the problem of counting all matchings (possibly containing unmatched
vertices, also known as defects) is known to be #P-complete on planar graphs.
To interpolate between the hard case of counting matchings and the easy case of
counting perfect matchings, we study the parameterized problem of counting
matchings with exactly k unmatched vertices in a planar graph G, on input G and
k. This setting has a natural interpretation in statistical physics, and it is
a special case of counting perfect matchings in k-apex graphs (graphs that can
be turned planar by removing at most k vertices).
  Starting from a recent #W[1]-hardness proof for counting perfect matchings on
k-apex graphs, we obtain that counting matchings with k unmatched vertices in
planar graphs is #W[1]-hard. In contrast, given a plane graph G with s
distinguished faces, there is an $O(2^s \cdot n^3)$ time algorithm for counting
those matchings with k unmatched vertices such that all unmatched vertices lie
on the distinguished faces. This implies an $f(k,s)\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time
algorithm for counting perfect matchings in k-apex graphs whose apex
neighborhood is covered by s faces.

 <dc:description>  Quantum position verification (QPV) is the art of verifying the geographical
location of an untrusted party. Recently, it has been shown that the widely
studied Bennett &amp; Brassard 1984 (BB84) QPV protocol is insecure after the 3 dB
loss point assuming local operations and classical communication (LOCC)
adversaries. Here, we propose a time-reversed entanglement swapping QPV
protocol (based on measurement-device-independent quantum cryptography) that is
highly robust against quantum channel loss. First, assuming ideal qubit
sources, we show that the protocol is secure against LOCC adversaries for any
quantum channel loss, thereby overcoming the 3 dB loss limit. Then, we analyze
the security of the protocol in a more practical setting involving weak laser
sources and linear optics. In this setting, we find that the security only
degrades by an additive constant and the protocol is able to verify positions
up to 47 dB channel loss.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have led to many state-of-the-art results
spanning through various fields. However, a clear and profound theoretical
understanding of the forward pass, the core algorithm of CNN, is still lacking.
In parallel, within the wide field of sparse approximation, Convolutional
Sparse Coding (CSC) has gained increasing attention in recent years. A
theoretical study of this model was recently conducted, establishing it as a
reliable and stable alternative to the commonly practiced patch-based
processing. Herein, we propose a novel multi-layer model, ML-CSC, in which
signals are assumed to emerge from a cascade of CSC layers. This is shown to be
tightly connected to CNN, so much so that the forward pass of the CNN is in
fact the thresholding pursuit serving the ML-CSC model. This connection brings
a fresh view to CNN, as we are able to attribute to this architecture
theoretical claims such as uniqueness of the representations throughout the
network, and their stable estimation, all guaranteed under simple local
sparsity conditions. Lastly, identifying the weaknesses in the above pursuit
scheme, we propose an alternative to the forward pass, which is connected to
deconvolutional, recurrent and residual networks, and has better theoretical
guarantees.

 <dc:description>  We present a new framework for vision-based estimation of calorific
expenditure from RGB-D data - the first that is validated on physical gas
exchange measurements and applied to daily living scenarios. Deriving a
person's energy expenditure from sensors is an important tool in tracking
physical activity levels for health and lifestyle monitoring. Most existing
methods use metabolic lookup tables (METs) for a manual estimate or systems
with inertial sensors which ultimately require users to wear devices. In
contrast, the proposed pose-invariant and individual-independent vision
framework allows for a remote estimation of calorific expenditure. We
introduce, and evaluate our approach on, a new dataset called SPHERE-calorie,
for which visual estimates can be compared against simultaneously obtained,
indirect calorimetry measures based on gas exchange. % based on per breath gas
exchange. We conclude from our experiments that the proposed vision pipeline is
suitable for home monitoring in a controlled environment, with calorific
expenditure estimates above accuracy levels of commonly used manual estimations
via METs. With the dataset released, our work establishes a baseline for future
research for this little-explored area of computer vision.

 <dc:description>  Fifth-generation (5G) cellular networks are expected to exhibit at least
three primary physical-layer differences relative to fourth-generation ones:
millimeter-wave propagation, massive antenna arrays, and densification of base
stations. As in fourth-generation systems, such as LTE, 5G systems are likely
to continue to use single-carrier frequency division multiple-access (SC-FDMA)
on the uplink due to its advantageous peak-to-average power ratio. Moreover, 5G
systems are likely to use frequency hopping on the uplink to help randomize
interference and provide diversity against frequency-selective fading. In this
paper, the implications of these and other physical-layer features on uplink
performance are assessed using a novel millimeter-wave propagation model
featuring distance-dependent parameters that characterize the path-loss,
shadowing, and fading. The analysis proceeds by first fixing the location of
the mobile devices and finding the performance conditioned on the topology. The
spatially averaged performance is then found by averaging with respect to the
location of the mobile devices. The analysis allows for the use of actual
base-station topologies and the propagation model can leverage empirical
millimeter-wave measurements. The benefits of base-station densification,
highly directional sectorization, frequency hopping, a large available
bandwidth, and a high code rate are illustrated. The minor importance of
fractional power control is shown.

 <dc:title>Collective benefits in traffic during mega events via the use of

 <dc:description>  Information technologies today can inform each of us about the best
alternatives for shortest paths from origins to destinations, but they do not
contain incentives or alternatives that manage the information efficiently to
get collective benefits. To obtain such benefits, we need to have not only good
estimates of how the traffic is formed but also to have target strategies to
reduce enough vehicles from the best possible roads in a feasible way. The
opportunity is that during large events the traffic inconveniences in large
cities are unusually high, yet temporary, and the entire population may be more
willing to adopt collective recommendations for social good. In this paper, we
integrate for the first time big data resources to quantify the impact of
events and propose target strategies for collective good at urban scale. In the
context of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, we first predict the expected
increase in traffic. To that end, we integrate data from: mobile phones,
Airbnb, Waze, and transit information, with game schedules and information of
venues. Next, we evaluate the impact of the Olympic Games to the travel of
commuters, and propose different route choice scenarios during the peak hours.
Moreover, we gather information on the trips that contribute the most to the
global congestion and that could be redirected from vehicles to transit.
Interestingly, we show that (i) following new route alternatives during the
event with individual shortest path can save more collective travel time than
keeping the routine routes, uncovering the positive value of information
technologies during events; (ii) with only a small proportion of people
selected from specific areas switching from driving to public transport, the
collective travel time can be reduced to a great extent. Results are presented
on-line for the evaluation of the public and policy makers.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make
diagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. A discomfort drawing is an
intuitive way for patients to express discomfort and pain related symptoms.
These drawings have proven to be an effective method to collect patient data
and make diagnostic decisions in real-life practice. A dataset from real-world
patient cases is collected for which medical experts provide diagnostic labels.
Next, we use a factorized multimodal topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model
(IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic predictions given an unseen
discomfort drawing. The number of output diagnostic labels is determined by
using mean-shift clustering on the discomfort drawing. Experimental results
show reasonable predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort
drawing. Additionally, we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM
given a diagnostic label, which results in typical cases of symptoms. The
positive result indicates a significant potential of machine learning to be
used for parts of the pain diagnostic process and to be a decision support
system for physicians and other health care personnel.

 <dc:description>  A networked controlled system (NCS) in which the plant communicates to the
controller over a channel with random delay loss is considered. The channel
model is motivated by recent development of tree codes for NCS, which
effectively translates an erasure channel to one with random delay. A causal
transform coding scheme is presented which exploits the plant state memory for
efficient communications (compression) and provides robustness to channel delay
loss. In this setting, we analyze the performance of linear quadratic Gaussian
(LQG) closed-loop systems and the design of the optimal controller. The design
of the transform code for LQG systems is posed as a channel optimized source
coding problem of minimizing a weighted mean squared error over the channel.
The solution is characterized in two steps of obtaining the optimized causal
encoding and decoding transforms and rate allocation across a set of transform
coding quantizers. Numerical and simulation results for Gauss-Markov sources
and an LQG system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

 <dc:description>  As part of its 25th anniversary vision-setting process, the arXiv team at
Cornell University Library conducted a user survey in April 2016 to seek input
from the global user community about arXiv's current services and future
directions. We were heartened to receive 36,000 responses from 127 countries,
representing arXiv's diverse, global community. The prevailing message is that
users are happy with the service as it currently stands, with 95 percent of
survey respondents indicating they are very satisfied or satisfied with arXiv.
Furthermore, 72 percent of respondents indicated that arXiv should continue to
focus on its main purpose, which is to quickly make available scientific
papers, and this will be enough to sustain the value of arXiv in the future.
This theme was pervasively reflected in the open text comments; a significant
number of respondents suggested remaining focused on the core mission and
enabling arXiv's partners and related service providers to continue to build
new services and innovations on top of arXiv.

 <dc:description>  The problem of recovering a one-dimensional signal from its Fourier transform
magnitude, called Fourier phase retrieval, is ill-posed in most cases. We
consider the closely-related problem of recovering a signal from its phaseless
short-time Fourier transform (STFT) measurements. This problem arises naturally
in several applications, such as ultra-short laser pulse characterization and
ptychography. The redundancy offered by the STFT enables unique recovery under
mild conditions. We show that in some cases the unique solution can be obtained
by the principal eigenvector of a matrix, constructed as the solution of a
simple least-squares problem. When these conditions are not met, we suggest
using the principal eigenvector of this matrix to initialize non-convex local
optimization algorithms and propose two such methods. The first is based on
minimizing the empirical risk loss function, while the second maximizes a
quadratic function on the manifold of phases. We prove that under appropriate
conditions, the proposed initialization is close to the underlying signal. We
then analyze the geometry of the empirical risk loss function and show
numerically that both gradient algorithms converge to the underlying signal
even with small redundancy in the measurements. In addition, the algorithms are
robust to noise.

 <dc:description>  Computing $k$-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the core kernels used in many
machine learning, data mining and scientific computing applications. Although
kd-tree based $O(\log n)$ algorithms have been proposed for computing KNN, due
to its inherent sequentiality, linear algorithms are being used in practice.
This limits the applicability of such methods to millions of data points, with
limited scalability for Big Data analytics challenges in the scientific domain.
In this paper, we present parallel and highly optimized kd-tree based KNN
algorithms (both construction and querying) suitable for distributed
architectures. Our algorithm includes novel approaches for pruning search space
and improving load balancing and partitioning among nodes and threads. Using
TB-sized datasets from three science applications: astrophysics, plasma
physics, and particle physics, we show that our implementation can construct
kd-tree of 189 billion particles in 48 seconds on utilizing $\sim$50,000 cores.
We also demonstrate computation of KNN of 19 billion queries in 12 seconds. We
demonstrate almost linear speedup both for shared and distributed memory
computers. Our algorithms outperforms earlier implementations by more than
order of magnitude; thereby radically improving the applicability of our
implementation to state-of-the-art Big Data analytics problems. In addition, we
showcase performance and scalability on the recently released Intel Xeon Phi
processor showing that our algorithm scales well even on massively parallel
architectures.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we design a benchmark task and provide the associated datasets
for recognizing face images and link them to corresponding entity keys in a
knowledge base. More specifically, we propose a benchmark task to recognize one
million celebrities from their face images, by using all the possibly collected
face images of this individual on the web as training data. The rich
information provided by the knowledge base helps to conduct disambiguation and
improve the recognition accuracy, and contributes to various real-world
applications, such as image captioning and news video analysis. Associated with
this task, we design and provide concrete measurement set, evaluation protocol,
as well as training data. We also present in details our experiment setup and
report promising baseline results. Our benchmark task could lead to one of the
largest classification problems in computer vision. To the best of our
knowledge, our training dataset, which contains 10M images in version 1, is the
largest publicly available one in the world.

 <dc:description>  TV White Spaces have recently been proposed as an alternative to alleviate
the spectrum crunch, characterised by the need to reallocate frequency bands to
accommodate the ever-growing demand for wireless communications. In this paper,
we discuss the motivations and challenges for collecting spectrum measurements
in developing regions and discuss a scalable system for communities to gather
and provide access to White Spaces information through open and regionalised
repositories. We further discuss two relevant aspects. First, we propose a
cooperative mechanism for sensing spectrum availability using a detector
approach. Second, we propose a strategy (and an architecture) on the database
side to implement spectrum governance. Other aspects of the work include
discussion of an extensive measurement campaign showing a number of white
spaces in developing regions, an overview of our experience on low-cost
spectrum analysers, and the architecture of zebra-rfo, an application for
processing crowd-sourced spectrum data.

 <dc:description>  The growing popularity and adoption of differential privacy in academic and
industrial settings has resulted in the development of increasingly
sophisticated algorithms for releasing information while preserving privacy.
Accompanying this phenomenon is the natural rise in the development and
publication of incorrect algorithms, thus demonstrating the necessity of formal
verification tools. However, existing formal methods for differential privacy
face a dilemma: methods based on customized logics can verify sophisticated
algorithms but come with a steep learning curve and significant annotation
burden on the programmers, while existing programming platforms lack expressive
power for some sophisticated algorithms.
  In this paper, we present LightDP, a simple imperative language that strikes
a better balance between expressive power and usability. The core of LightDP is
a novel relational type system that separates relational reasoning from privacy
budget calculations. With dependent types, the type system is powerful enough
to verify sophisticated algorithms where the composition theorem falls short.
In addition, the inference engine of LightDP infers most of the proof details,
and even searches for the proof with minimal privacy cost bound when multiple
proofs exist. We show that LightDP verifies sophisticated algorithms with
little manual effort.

 <dc:description>  As an alternative to conventional multi-pixel cameras, single-pixel cameras
enable images to be recorded using a single detector that measures the
correlations between the scene and a set of patterns. However, to fully sample
a scene in this way requires at least the same number of correlation
measurements as there are pixels in the reconstructed image. Therefore
single-pixel imaging systems typically exhibit low frame-rates. To mitigate
this, a range of compressive sensing techniques have been developed which rely
on a priori knowledge of the scene to reconstruct images from an under-sampled
set of measurements. In this work we take a different approach and adopt a
strategy inspired by the foveated vision systems found in the animal kingdom -
a framework that exploits the spatio-temporal redundancy present in many
dynamic scenes. In our single-pixel imaging system a high-resolution foveal
region follows motion within the scene, but unlike a simple zoom, every frame
delivers new spatial information from across the entire field-of-view. Using
this approach we demonstrate a four-fold reduction in the time taken to record
the detail of rapidly evolving features, whilst simultaneously accumulating
detail of more slowly evolving regions over several consecutive frames. This
tiered super-sampling technique enables the reconstruction of video streams in
which both the resolution and the effective exposure-time spatially vary and
adapt dynamically in response to the evolution of the scene. The methods
described here can complement existing compressive sensing approaches and may
be applied to enhance a variety of computational imagers that rely on
sequential correlation measurements.

 <dc:description>  We study Frank-Wolfe methods for nonconvex stochastic and finite-sum
optimization problems. Frank-Wolfe methods (in the convex case) have gained
tremendous recent interest in machine learning and optimization communities due
to their projection-free property and their ability to exploit structured
constraints. However, our understanding of these algorithms in the nonconvex
setting is fairly limited. In this paper, we propose nonconvex stochastic
Frank-Wolfe methods and analyze their convergence properties. For objective
functions that decompose into a finite-sum, we leverage ideas from variance
reduction techniques for convex optimization to obtain new variance reduced
nonconvex Frank-Wolfe methods that have provably faster convergence than the
classical Frank-Wolfe method. Finally, we show that the faster convergence
rates of our variance reduced methods also translate into improved convergence
rates for the stochastic setting.

with different unknown parameters under the general framework of binary

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the slicing of Radio Access Network (RAN) resources by
multiple tenants, e.g., virtual wireless operators and service providers. We
consider a criterion for dynamic resource allocation amongst tenants, based on
a weighted proportionally fair objective, which achieves desirable
fairness/protection across the network slices of the different tenants and
their associated users. Several key properties are established, including: the
Pareto optimality of user association to base stations, the fair allocation of
base stations resources, and the gains resulting from dynamic resource sharing
across slices, both in terms of utility gains and capacity savings. We then
address algorithmic and practical challenges in realizing the proposed
criterion. We show that the objective is NP-hard, making an exact solution
impractical, and design a distributed semi-online algorithm which meets
performance guarantees in equilibrium and can be shown to quickly converge to a
region around the equilibrium point. Building on this algorithm, we devise a
practical approach with limited computational, information, and handoff
overheads. We use detailed simulations to show that our approach is indeed
near-optimal and provides substantial gains both to tenants (in terms of
capacity savings) and end-users (in terms of improved performance).

 <dc:description>  We present a method for accelerating explicit-state backward search
algorithms for systems of arbitrarily many finite-state threads. Our method
statically analyzes the program executed by the threads for the existence of
simple loops. We show how such loops can be collapsed without approximation
into Presburger arithmetic constraints that symbolically summarize the effect
of executing the backward search algorithm along the loop in the multi-threaded
program. As a result, the subsequent explicit-state search does not need to
explore the summarized part of the state space. The combination of concrete and
symbolic exploration gives our algorithm a concolic flavor. We demonstrate the
power of this method for proving and refuting safety properties of
unbounded-thread programs.

 <dc:description>  In recent time, the standards for Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) matured and scientific and industry
interest is high especially as autonomous driving gets a lot of media
attention. Autonomous driving and other assistance systems for cars make heavy
use of VANETs to exchange information.They may provide more comfort, security
and safety for drivers. However, it is of crucial importance for the user's
trust in these assistance systems that they could not be influenced by
malicious users. VANETs are likely attack vectors for such malicious users,
hence application-specific security requirements must be considered during the
design of applications using VANETs. In literature, many attacks on vehicular
communication have been described but attacks on specific vehicular networking
applications are often missing. This paper fills in this gap by describing
standardized vehicular networking applications, defining and extending previous
attacker models, and using the resulting new models to characterize the
possible attackers interested in the specific vehicular networking application.
The attacker models presented in this paper hopefully provide great benefit for
the scientific community and industry as they allow to compare security
evaluations of different works, characterize attackers, their intentions and
help to plan application-specific security controls for vehicular networking
applications.

 <dc:description>  Characterizing human values is a topic deeply interwoven with the sciences,
humanities, art, and many other human endeavors. In recent years, a number of
thinkers have argued that accelerating trends in computer science, cognitive
science, and related disciplines foreshadow the creation of intelligent
machines which meet and ultimately surpass the cognitive abilities of human
beings, thereby entangling an understanding of human values with future
technological development. Contemporary research accomplishments suggest
sophisticated AI systems becoming widespread and responsible for managing many
aspects of the modern world, from preemptively planning users' travel schedules
and logistics, to fully autonomous vehicles, to domestic robots assisting in
daily living. The extrapolation of these trends has been most forcefully
described in the context of a hypothetical &quot;intelligence explosion,&quot; in which
the capabilities of an intelligent software agent would rapidly increase due to
the presence of feedback loops unavailable to biological organisms. The
possibility of superintelligent agents, or simply the widespread deployment of
sophisticated, autonomous AI systems, highlights an important theoretical
problem: the need to separate the cognitive and rational capacities of an agent
from the fundamental goal structure, or value system, which constrains and
guides the agent's actions. The &quot;value alignment problem&quot; is to specify a goal
structure for autonomous agents compatible with human values. In this brief
article, we suggest that recent ideas from affective neuroscience and related
disciplines aimed at characterizing neurological and behavioral universals in
the mammalian kingdom provide important conceptual foundations relevant to
describing human values. We argue that the notion of &quot;mammalian value systems&quot;
points to a potential avenue for fundamental research in AI safety and AI
ethics.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Tian et al. [1] considered joint source-channel coding of
transmitting a Gaussian source over $K$-user Gaussian broadcast channel, and
derived an outer bound on the admissible distortion region. In [1], they stated
&quot;due to its nonlinear form, it appears difficult to determine whether it is
always looser than the trivial outer bound in all distortion regimes with
bandwidth compression&quot;. However, in this correspondence we solve this problem
and prove that for the bandwidth expansion case ($K\geq2$), this outer bound is
strictly tighter than the trivial outer bound with each user being optimal in
the point-to-point setting; while for the bandwidth compression or bandwidth
match case, this outer bound actually degenerates to the trivial outer bound.
Therefore, our results imply that on one hand, the outer bound given in [1] is
nontrivial only for Gaussian broadcast communication ($K\geq2$) with bandwidth
expansion; on the other hand, unfortunately, no nontrivial outer bound exists
so far for Gaussian broadcast communication ($K\geq2$) with bandwidth
compression.

 <dc:description>  A single-letter lower bound on the sum rate of multiple description coding
with tree-structured distortion constraints is established by generalizing
Ozarow's celebrated converse argument through the introduction of auxiliary
random variables that form a Markov tree. For the quadratic vector Gaussian
case, this lower bound is shown to be achievable by an extended version of the
El Gamal-Cover scheme, yielding a complete sum-rate characterization.

 <dc:description>  We study the intersection of finitely generated subgroups of free groups by
utilizing the method of linear programming. We prove that if $H_1$ is a
finitely generated subgroup of a free group $F$, then the WN-coefficient
$\sigma(H_1)$ of $H_1$ is rational and can be computed in deterministic
exponential time in the size of $H_1$. This coefficient $\sigma(H_1)$ is the
minimal nonnegative real number such that, for every finitely generated
subgroup $H_2$ of $F$, it is true that $\bar {\rm r}(H_1, H_2) \le \sigma(H_1)
\bar {\rm r}(H_1) \bar {\rm r}(H_2)$, where $\bar{ {\rm r}} (H) := \max ( {\rm
r} (H)-1,0)$ is the reduced rank of $H$, ${\rm r} (H)$ is the rank of $H$, and
$\bar {\rm r}(H_1, H_2)$ is the reduced rank of the generalized intersection of
$H_1$ and $H_2$. We also show the existence of a subgroup $H_2^* = H_2^*(H_1)$
of $F$ such that $\bar {\rm r}(H_1, H_2^*) = \sigma(H_1) \bar {\rm r}(H_1) \bar
{\rm r}(H_2^*)$, the Stallings graph $\Gamma(H_2^*)$ of $H_2^*$ has at most
doubly exponential size in the size of $H_1$ and $\Gamma(H_2^*)$ can be
constructed in exponential time in the size of $H_1$.

 <dc:description>  Vector Stream Cipher (VSC) is a stream cipher which consists of permutation
polynomial over a ring of modulo $2^w$. The algorithm for generating key stream
is very simple and the encryption is very fast. Some theoretical attacks for
VSC have been reported so far since the invention of VSC in 2004. Then, the
authors proposed some improvements and developed &quot;Vector Stream Cipher 2.0 (VSC
2.0)&quot; to be immune against the theoretical attacks. In this paper, we propose
further improvement of VSC 2.0 to publish as a new chaos cipher &quot;Vector Stream
Cipher 2.1 (VSC2.1)&quot;. VSC 2.1 is faster and more secure than VSC 2.0. Our
result suggests that permutation polynomials over a ring of modulo $2^w$ are
useful for cryptography.

 <dc:description>  Automatically searching for optimal hyperparameter configurations is of
crucial importance for applying deep learning algorithms in practice. Recently,
Bayesian optimization has been proposed for optimizing hyperparameters of
various machine learning algorithms. Those methods adopt probabilistic
surrogate models like Gaussian processes to approximate and minimize the
validation error function of hyperparameter values. However, probabilistic
surrogates require accurate estimates of sufficient statistics (e.g.,
covariance) of the error distribution and thus need many function evaluations
with a sizeable number of hyperparameters. This makes them inefficient for
optimizing hyperparameters of deep learning algorithms, which are highly
expensive to evaluate. In this work, we propose a new deterministic and
efficient hyperparameter optimization method that employs radial basis
functions as error surrogates. The proposed mixed integer algorithm, called
HORD, searches the surrogate for the most promising hyperparameter values
through dynamic coordinate search and requires many fewer function evaluations.
HORD does well in low dimensions but it is exceptionally better in higher
dimensions. Extensive evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 for four deep neural
networks demonstrate HORD significantly outperforms the well-established
Bayesian optimization methods such as GP, SMAC, and TPE. For instance, on
average, HORD is more than 6 times faster than GP-EI in obtaining the best
configuration of 19 hyperparameters.

 <dc:description>  Cooperative regenerating codes are designed for repairing multiple node
failures in distributed storage systems. In contrast to the original repair
model of regenerating codes, which are for the repair of single node failure,
data exchange among the new nodes is enabled. It is known that further
reduction in repair bandwidth is possible with cooperative repair. Currently in
the literature, we have an explicit construction of exact-repair cooperative
code achieving all parameters corresponding to the minimum-bandwidth point. We
give a slightly generalized and more flexible version of this cooperative
regenerating code in this paper. For minimum-storage regeneration with
cooperation, we present an explicit code construction which can jointly repair
any number of systematic storage nodes.

 <dc:description>  IoT Big Data requires new machine learning methods able to scale to large
size of data arriving at high speed. Decision trees are popular machine
learning models since they are very effective, yet easy to interpret and
visualize. In the literature, we can find distributed algorithms for learning
decision trees, and also streaming algorithms, but not algorithms that combine
both features. In this paper we present the Vertical Hoeffding Tree (VHT), the
first distributed streaming algorithm for learning decision trees. It features
a novel way of distributing decision trees via vertical parallelism. The
algorithm is implemented on top of Apache SAMOA, a platform for mining
distributed data streams, and thus able to run on real-world clusters. We run
several experiments to study the accuracy and throughput performance of our new
VHT algorithm, as well as its ability to scale while keeping its superior
performance with respect to non-distributed decision trees.

 <dc:title>Robust Contextual Outlier Detection: Where Context Meets Sparsity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Outlier detection is a fundamental data science task with applications
ranging from data cleaning to network security. Given the fundamental nature of
the task, this has been the subject of much research. Recently, a new class of
outlier detection algorithms has emerged, called {\it contextual outlier
detection}, and has shown improved performance when studying anomalous behavior
in a specific context. However, as we point out in this article, such
approaches have limited applicability in situations where the context is sparse
(i.e. lacking a suitable frame of reference). Moreover, approaches developed to
date do not scale to large datasets. To address these problems, here we propose
a novel and robust approach alternative to the state-of-the-art called RObust
Contextual Outlier Detection (ROCOD). We utilize a local and global behavioral
model based on the relevant contexts, which is then integrated in a natural and
robust fashion. We also present several optimizations to improve the
scalability of the approach. We run ROCOD on both synthetic and real-world
datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms other competitive baselines on the
axes of efficacy and efficiency (40X speedup compared to modern contextual
outlier detection methods). We also drill down and perform a fine-grained
analysis to shed light on the rationale for the performance gains of ROCOD and
reveal its effectiveness when handling objects with sparse contexts.

 <dc:description>  Drawing on an analogy with the second law of thermodynamics for adiabatically
isolated systems, Cover argued that data-processing inequalities may be seen as
second laws for &quot;computationally isolated systems,&quot; namely, systems evolving
without an external memory. Here we develop Cover's idea in two ways: on the
one hand, we clarify its meaning and formulate it in a general framework able
to describe both classical and quantum systems. On the other hand, we prove
that also the reverse holds: the validity of data-processing inequalities is
not only necessary, but also sufficient to conclude that a system is
computationally isolated. This constitutes an information-theoretic analogue of
Lieb's and Yngvason's entropy principle. We finally speculate about the
possibility of employing Maxwell's demon to show that adiabaticity and
memorylessness are in fact connected in a deeper way than what the formal
analogy proposed here prima facie seems to suggest.

 <dc:title>Efficient Algorithms for Constructing Very Sparse Spanners and Emulators</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Miller et al. \cite{MPVX15} devised a distributed\footnote{They actually
showed a PRAM algorithm. The distributed algorithm with these properties is
implicit in \cite{MPVX15}.} algorithm in the CONGEST model, that given a
parameter $k = 1,2,\ldots$, constructs an $O(k)$-spanner of an input unweighted
$n$-vertex graph with $O(n^{1+1/k})$ expected edges in $O(k)$ rounds of
communication. In this paper we improve the result of \cite{MPVX15}, by showing
a $k$-round distributed algorithm in the same model, that constructs a
$(2k-1)$-spanner with $O(n^{1+1/k}/\epsilon)$ edges, with probability $1-
\epsilon$, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. Moreover, when $k = \omega(\log n)$, our
algorithm produces (still in $k$ rounds) {\em ultra-sparse} spanners, i.e.,
spanners of size $n(1+ o(1))$, with probability $1- o(1)$. To our knowledge,
this is the first distributed algorithm in the CONGEST or in the PRAM models
that constructs spanners or skeletons (i.e., connected spanning subgraphs) that
sparse. Our algorithm can also be implemented in linear time in the standard
centralized model, and for large $k$, it provides spanners that are sparser
than any other spanner given by a known (near-)linear time algorithm.
  We also devise improved bounds (and algorithms realizing these bounds) for
$(1+\epsilon,\beta)$-spanners and emulators. In particular, we show that for
any unweighted $n$-vertex graph and any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there exists a $(1+
\epsilon, ({{\log\log n} \over \epsilon})^{\log\log n})$-emulator with $O(n)$
edges. All previous constructions of $(1+\epsilon,\beta)$-spanners and
emulators employ a superlinear number of edges, for all choices of parameters.
  Finally, we provide some applications of our results to approximate shortest
paths' computation in unweighted graphs.

 <dc:description>  Indexing of very large collections of strings such as those produced by the
widespread sequencing technologies, heavily relies on multi-string
generalizations of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), and for this problem
various in-memory algorithms have been proposed. The rapid growing of data that
are processed routinely, such as in bioinformatics, requires a large amount of
main memory, and this fact has motivated the development of algorithms, to
compute the BWT, that work almost entirely in external memory. On the other
hand, the related problem of computing the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) array is
often instrumental in several algorithms on collection of strings, such as
those that compute the suffix-prefix overlap among strings, which is an
essential step for many genome assembly algorithms. The best current
lightweight approach to compute BWT and LCP array on a set of $m$ strings, each
one $k$ characters long, has I/O complexity that is $O(mk^2 \log |\Sigma|)$
(where $|\Sigma|$ is the size of the alphabet), thus it is not optimal. In this
paper we propose a novel approach to build BWT and LCP array (simultaneously)
with $O(kmL(\log k +\log \sigma))$ I/O complexity, where $L$ is the length of
longest substring that appears at least twice in the input strings.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents AUGURY, an application for the analysis of monitoring
data from computers, servers or cloud infrastructures. The analysis is based on
the extraction of patterns and trends from historical data, using elements of
time-series analysis. The purpose of AUGURY is to aid a server administrator by
forecasting the behaviour and resource usage of specific applications and in
presenting a status report in a concise manner. AUGURY provides tools for
identifying network traffic congestion and peak usage times, and for making
memory usage projections. The application data processing specialises in two
tasks: the parametrisation of the memory usage of individual applications and
the extraction of the seasonal component from network traffic data. AUGURY uses
a different underlying assumption for each of these two tasks. With respect to
the memory usage, a limited number of single-valued parameters are assumed to
be sufficient to parameterize any application being hosted on the server.
Regarding the network traffic data, long-term patterns, such as hourly or daily
exist and are being induced by work-time schedules and automatised
administrative jobs. In this paper, the implementation of each of the two tasks
is presented, tested using locally-generated data, and applied to data from
weather forecasting applications hosted on a web server. This data is used to
demonstrate the insight that AUGURY can add to the monitoring of server and
cloud infrastructures.

 <dc:description>  This manuscript is about further elucidating the concept of noising. The
concept of noising first appeared in \cite{CVPR14}, in the context of curvature
estimation and vertex localization on planar shapes. There are indications that
noising can play for global methods the role smoothing plays for local methods
in this task. This manuscript is about investigating this claim by introducing
incremental noising, in a recursive deterministic manner, analogous to how
smoothing is extended to progressive smoothing in similar tasks. As
investigating the properties and behavior of incremental noising is the purpose
of this manuscript, a surprising connection between incremental noising and
progressive smoothing is revealed by the experiments. To explain this
phenomenon, the fractal and the space filling properties of the two methods
respectively, are considered in a unifying context.

 <dc:description>  An approach to the formal description of service contracts is presented in
terms of automata. We focus on the basic property of guaranteeing that in the
multi-party composition of principals each of them gets his requests satisfied,
so that the overall composition reaches its goal. Depending on whether requests
are satisfied synchronously or asynchronously, we construct an orchestrator
that at static time either yields composed services enjoying the required
properties or detects the principals responsible for possible violations. To do
that in the asynchronous case we resort to Linear Programming techniques. We
also relate our automata with two logically based methods for specifying
contracts.

the past 25 years in classifying images into abstractc lasses. For this purpose
we compare the performance of LeNet to that of GoogLeNet at classifying
randomly generated images which are differentiated by an abstract property
(e.g., one class contains two objects of the same size, the other class two
objects of different sizes). Our results show that there is still work to do in
order to solve vision problems humans are able to solve without much
difficulty.

 <dc:title>Local Feature Detectors, Descriptors, and Image Representations: A
  Survey</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Uchida, Yusuke</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the advances in both stable interest region detectors and robust and
distinctive descriptors, local feature-based image or object retrieval has
become a popular research topic. %All of the local feature-based image
retrieval system involves two important processes: local feature extraction and
image representation. The other key technology for image retrieval systems is
image representation such as the bag-of-visual words (BoVW), Fisher vector, or
Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) framework. In this paper, we
review local features and image representations for image retrieval. Because
many and many methods are proposed in this area, these methods are grouped into
several classes and summarized. In addition, recent deep learning-based
approaches for image retrieval are briefly reviewed.

 <dc:description>  To quantify the mechanism of a complex network growth we focus on the network
of citations of scientific papers and use a combination of the theoretical and
experimental tools to uncover microscopic details of this network growth.
Namely, we develop a stochastic model of citation dynamics based on
copying/redirection/triadic closure mechanism. In a complementary and coherent
way, the model accounts both for statistics of references of scientific papers
and for their citation dynamics. Originating in empirical measurements, the
model is cast in such a way that it can be verified quantitatively in every
aspect. Such verification is performed by measuring citation dynamics of
Physics papers. The measurements revealed nonlinear citation dynamics, the
nonlinearity being intricately related to network topology. The nonlinearity
has far-reaching consequences including non-stationary citation distributions,
diverging citation trajectory of similar papers, runaways or &quot;immortal papers&quot;
with infinite citation lifetime etc. Thus, our most important finding is
nonlinearity in complex network growth. In a more specific context, our results
can be a basis for quantitative probabilistic prediction of citation dynamics
of individual papers and of the journal impact factor.

 <dc:description>  Robotic ultrasound has the potential to assist and guide physicians during
interventions. In this work, we present a set of methods and a workflow to
enable autonomous MRI-guided ultrasound acquisitions. Our approach uses a
structured-light 3D scanner for patient-to-robot and image-to-patient
calibration, which in turn is used to plan 3D ultrasound trajectories. These
MRI-based trajectories are followed autonomously by the robot and are further
refined online using automatic MRI/US registration. Despite the low spatial
resolution of structured light scanners, the initial planned acquisition path
can be followed with an accuracy of 2.46 +/- 0.96 mm. This leads to a good
initialization of the MRI/US registration: the 3D-scan-based alignment for
planning and acquisition shows an accuracy (distance between planned ultrasound
and MRI) of 4.47 mm, and 0.97 mm after an online-update of the calibration
based on a closed loop registration.

 <dc:description>  Matching pedestrians across multiple camera views, known as human
re-identification, is a challenging research problem that has numerous
applications in visual surveillance. With the resurgence of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), several end-to-end deep Siamese CNN architectures have
been proposed for human re-identification with the objective of projecting the
images of similar pairs (i.e. same identity) to be closer to each other and
those of dissimilar pairs to be distant from each other. However, current
networks extract fixed representations for each image regardless of other
images which are paired with it and the comparison with other images is done
only at the final level. In this setting, the network is at risk of failing to
extract finer local patterns that may be essential to distinguish positive
pairs from hard negative pairs. In this paper, we propose a gating function to
selectively emphasize such fine common local patterns by comparing the
mid-level features across pairs of images. This produces flexible
representations for the same image according to the images they are paired
with. We conduct experiments on the CUHK03, Market-1501 and VIPeR datasets and
demonstrate improved performance compared to a baseline Siamese CNN
architecture.

 <dc:description>  Matching pedestrians across multiple camera views known as human
re-identification (re-identification) is a challenging problem in visual
surveillance. In the existing works concentrating on feature extraction,
representations are formed locally and independent of other regions. We present
a novel siamese Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture that can process
image regions sequentially and enhance the discriminative capability of local
feature representation by leveraging contextual information. The feedback
connections and internal gating mechanism of the LSTM cells enable our model to
memorize the spatial dependencies and selectively propagate relevant contextual
information through the network. We demonstrate improved performance compared
to the baseline algorithm with no LSTM units and promising results compared to
state-of-the-art methods on Market-1501, CUHK03 and VIPeR datasets.
Visualization of the internal mechanism of LSTM cells shows meaningful patterns

 <dc:description>  Rekeying refers to an operation of replacing an existing key with a new key
for encryption. It renews security protection, so as to protect against key
compromise and enable dynamic access control in cryptographic storage. However,
it is non-trivial to realize efficient rekeying in encrypted deduplication
storage systems, which use deterministic content-derived encryption keys to
allow deduplication on ciphertexts. We design and implement REED, a
rekeying-aware encrypted deduplication storage system. REED builds on a
deterministic version of all-or-nothing transform (AONT), such that it enables
secure and lightweight rekeying, while preserving the deduplication capability.
We propose two REED encryption schemes that trade between performance and
security, and extend REED for dynamic access control. We implement a REED
prototype with various performance optimization techniques and demonstrate how
we can exploit similarity to mitigate key generation overhead. Our trace-driven
testbed evaluation shows that our REED prototype maintains high performance and
storage efficiency.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study cooperative cognitive radio networks consisting of a
primary user and multiple secondary users. Secondary users transmit only when
primary user is sensed as silent and may interfere with primary transmission
due to imperfect sensing. When primary activity is sensed correctly, secondary
users cooperate with primary user by assisting retransmission of failed packets
of primary user. We analyze packet throughput of primary and secondary users
for three variations of proposed cooperation method. Signal flow graph (SFG)
based approach is employed to obtain closed form expressions of packet
throughput. The analysis is done for two cases; individual sensing and
cooperative sensing. Further, we characterize optimal transmission probability
of secondary users that maximizes individual secondary packet throughput
keeping all queues in the system stable. Results present a comparison of
throughput performance of proposed cooperation methods under different
scenarios and show their benefits for both primary as well as secondary user
throughput.

 <dc:description>  We here introduce a novel classification approach adopted from the nonlinear
model identification framework, which jointly addresses the feature selection
and classifier design tasks. The classifier is constructed as a polynomial
expansion of the original attributes and a model structure selection process is
applied to find the relevant terms of the model. The selection method
progressively refines a probability distribution defined on the model structure
space, by extracting sample models from the current distribution and using the
aggregate information obtained from the evaluation of the population of models
to reinforce the probability of extracting the most important terms. To reduce
the initial search space, distance correlation filtering can be applied as a
preprocessing technique. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to other
well-known feature selection and classification methods on standard benchmark
classification problems. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed
method with respect to competitor methods both in terms of classification
accuracy and model complexity. The obtained models have a simple structure,
easily amenable to interpretation and analysis.

 <dc:description>  The BIX protocol is a blockchain-based protocol that allows distribution of
certificates linking a subject with his public key, hence providing a service
similar to that of a PKI but without the need of a CA. In this paper we analyze
the security of the BIX protocol in a formal way, in four steps. First, we
identify formal security assumptions which are well-suited to this protocol.
Second, we present some attack scenarios against the BIX protocol. Third, we
provide a formal security proof that some of these attacks are not feasible
under our previously established assumptions. Finally, we show how another
attack may be carried on.

 <dc:description>  We present SEMBED, an approach for embedding an egocentric object interaction
video in a semantic-visual graph to estimate the probability distribution over
its potential semantic labels. When object interactions are annotated using
unbounded choice of verbs, we embrace the wealth and ambiguity of these labels
by capturing the semantic relationships as well as the visual similarities over
motion and appearance features. We show how SEMBED can interpret a challenging
dataset of 1225 freely annotated egocentric videos, outperforming SVM
classification by more than 5%.

 <dc:description>  Videos acquired in low-light conditions often exhibit motion blur, which
depends on the motion of the objects relative to the camera. This is not only
visually unpleasing, but can hamper further processing. With this paper we are
the first to show how the availability of stereo video can aid the challenging
video deblurring task. We leverage 3D scene flow, which can be estimated
robustly even under adverse conditions. We go beyond simply determining the
object motion in two ways: First, we show how a piecewise rigid 3D scene flow
representation allows to induce accurate blur kernels via local homographies.
Second, we exploit the estimated motion boundaries of the 3D scene flow to
mitigate ringing artifacts using an iterative weighting scheme. Being aware of
3D object motion, our approach can deal robustly with an arbitrary number of
independently moving objects. We demonstrate its benefit over state-of-the-art
video deblurring using quantitative and qualitative experiments on rendered
scenes and real videos.

 <dc:description>  Data compression has become a necessity not only the in the field of
communication but also in various scientific experiments. The data that is
being received is more and the processing time required has also become more. A
significant change in the algorithms will help to optimize the processing
speed. With the invention of Technologies like IoT and in technologies like
Machine Learning there is a need to compress data. For example training an
Artificial Neural Network requires a lot of data that should be processed and
trained in small interval of time for which compression will be very helpful.
There is a need to process the data faster and quicker. In this paper we
present a method that reduces the data size. This method is known as Optimized
Huffmans Coding. In the Huffmans coding we encode the messages so as to reduce
the data and here in the optimized Huffmans coding we compress the data to a
great extent which helps in various signal processing algorithms and has
advantages in many applications. Here in this paper we have presented the
Optimized Huffmans Coding method for Text compression. This method but has
advantages over the normal Huffmans coding. This algorithm presented here says
that every letter can be grouped together and encoded which not only reduces
the size but also the Huffmans Tree data that is required for decoding, hence
reducing the data size. This method has huge scientific applications.

 <dc:title>Video Registration in Egocentric Vision under Day and Night Illumination

 <dc:description>  With the spread of wearable devices and head mounted cameras, a wide range of
application requiring precise user localization is now possible. In this paper
we propose to treat the problem of obtaining the user position with respect to
a known environment as a video registration problem. Video registration, i.e.
the task of aligning an input video sequence to a pre-built 3D model, relies on
a matching process of local keypoints extracted on the query sequence to a 3D
point cloud. The overall registration performance is strictly tied to the
actual quality of this 2D-3D matching, and can degrade if environmental
conditions such as steep changes in lighting like the ones between day and
night occur. To effectively register an egocentric video sequence under these
conditions, we propose to tackle the source of the problem: the matching
process. To overcome the shortcomings of standard matching techniques, we
introduce a novel embedding space that allows us to obtain robust matches by
jointly taking into account local descriptors, their spatial arrangement and
their temporal robustness. The proposal is evaluated using unconstrained
egocentric video sequences both in terms of matching quality and resulting
registration performance using different 3D models of historical landmarks. The
results show that the proposed method can outperform state of the art
registration algorithms, in particular when dealing with the challenges of
night and day sequences.

 <dc:description>  As we shift more of our lives into the virtual domain, the volume of data
shared on the web keeps increasing and presents a threat to our privacy. This
works contributes to the understanding of privacy implications of such data
sharing by analysing how well people are recognisable in social media data. To
facilitate a systematic study we define a number of scenarios considering
factors such as how many heads of a person are tagged and if those heads are
obfuscated or not. We propose a robust person recognition system that can
handle large variations in pose and clothing, and can be trained with few
training samples. Our results indicate that a handful of images is enough to
threaten users' privacy, even in the presence of obfuscation. We show detailed
experimental results, and discuss their implications.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge on the dynamics of standard epidemic models and their variants over
complex networks has been well-established primarily in the stationary regime,
with relatively little light shed on their transient behavior. In this paper,
we analyze the transient characteristics of the classical susceptible-infected
(SI) process with a recovery policy modeled as a state-dependent retrial
queueing system in which arriving infected nodes, upon finding all the limited
number of recovery units busy, join a virtual buffer and try persistently for
service in order to regain susceptibility. In particular, we formulate the
stochastic SI epidemic model with added retrial phenomenon as a finite
continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) and derive the Laplace transforms of the
underlying transient state probability distributions and corresponding moments
for a closed population of size $N$ driven by homogeneous and heterogeneous
contacts. Our numerical results reveal the strong influence of infection
heterogeneity and retrial frequency on the transient behavior of the model for
various performance measures.

 <dc:title>An Efficient Representation for Filtrations of Simplicial Complexes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A filtration over a simplicial complex $K$ is an ordering of the simplices of
$K$ such that all prefixes in the ordering are subcomplexes of $K$. Filtrations
are at the core of Persistent Homology, a major tool in Topological Data
Analysis. In order to represent the filtration of a simplicial complex, the
entire filtration can be appended to any data structure that explicitly stores
all the simplices of the complex such as the Hasse diagram or the recently
introduced Simplex Tree [Algorithmica '14]. However, with the popularity of
various computational methods that need to handle simplicial complexes, and
with the rapidly increasing size of the complexes, the task of finding a
compact data structure that can still support efficient queries is of great
interest.
  In this paper, we propose a new data structure called the Critical Simplex
Diagram (CSD) which is a variant of the Simplex Array List (SAL) introduced by
Boissonnat et al. [SoCG '15]. Our data structure allows to store in a compact
way the filtration of a simplicial complex, and allows for the efficient
implementation of a large range of basic operations. Moreover, we prove that
our data structure is essentially optimal with respect to the requisite storage
space. Next, we show that the CSD representation admits the following
construction algorithms.
  $\bullet$ A new edge-deletion algorithm for the fast construction of Flag
complexes, which only depends on the number of critical simplices and the
number of vertices.
  $\bullet$ A new matrix-parsing algorithm to quickly construct the relaxed
Delaunay complexes, depending only on the number of witnesses and the dimension
of the complex.

 <dc:description>  Opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) is a promising reform paradigm envisioned
to address the issue of spectrum scarcity in cognitive radio networks (CRNs).
While current models consider various aspects of the OSA scheme, the impact of
retrial phenomenon in multi-channel CRNs has not yet been analyzed. In this
work, we present a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model in which the
blocked/preempted secondary users (SUs) enter a finite retrial group (or orbit)
and re-attempt independently for service in an exponentially distributed random
manner. Taking into account the inherent retrial tendency of SUs, we
numerically assess the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of dropping
probability and throughput of SUs.

 <dc:description>  Recently, a new structure called butterfly introduced by Perrin et at. is
attractive for that it has very good cryptographic properties: the differential
uniformity is at most equal to 4 and algebraic degree is also very high when
exponent $e=3$. It is conjecture that the nonlinearity is also optimal for
every odd $k$, which was proposed as a open problem. In this paper, we further
study the butterfly structures and show that these structure with exponent
$e=2^i+1$ have also very good cryptographic properties. More importantly, we
prove in theory the nonlinearity is optimal for every odd $k$, which completely
solve the open problem. Finally, we study the butter structures with trivial
coefficient and show these butterflies have also optimal nonlinearity.
Furthermore, we show that the closed butterflies with trivial coefficient are
bijective as well, which also can be used to serve as a cryptographic
primitive.

defining a kernel function on the data set. While previous approaches construct
a low-dimensional Euclidean embedding of the data set that reflects the given

high-dimensional embeddings. These kernel functions can subsequently be used to
apply any kernel method to the data set.

distribution of local connectivity patterns, i.e., network motifs. In this
work, a method for creating directed, unweighted networks while promoting a
certain combination of motifs is presented. This motif-based network algorithm
starts with an empty graph and randomly connects the nodes by advancing or
discouraging the formation of chosen motifs. The in- or out-degree distribution
of the generated networks can be explicitly chosen. The algorithm is shown to
perform well in producing networks with high occurrences of the targeted
motifs, both ones consisting of 3 nodes as well as ones consisting of 4 nodes.
Moreover, the algorithm can also be tuned to bring about global network
characteristics found in many natural networks, such as small-worldness and
modularity.

 <dc:description>  Hashing methods have been widely used for efficient similarity retrieval on
large scale image database. Traditional hashing methods learn hash functions to
generate binary codes from hand-crafted features, which achieve limited
accuracy since the hand-crafted features cannot optimally represent the image
content and preserve the semantic similarity. Recently, several deep hashing
methods have shown better performance because the deep architectures generate
more discriminative feature representations. However, these deep hashing
methods are mainly designed for supervised scenarios, which only exploit the
semantic similarity information, but ignore the underlying data structures. In
this paper, we propose the semi-supervised deep hashing (SSDH) approach, to
perform more effective hash function learning by simultaneously preserving
semantic similarity and underlying data structures. The main contributions are
as follows: (1) We propose a semi-supervised loss to jointly minimize the
empirical error on labeled data, as well as the embedding error on both labeled
and unlabeled data, which can preserve the semantic similarity and capture the
meaningful neighbors on the underlying data structures for effective hashing.
(2) A semi-supervised deep hashing network is designed to extensively exploit
both labeled and unlabeled data, in which we propose an online graph
construction method to benefit from the evolving deep features during training
to better capture semantic neighbors. To the best of our knowledge, the
proposed deep network is the first deep hashing method that can perform hash
code learning and feature learning simultaneously in a semi-supervised fashion.
Experimental results on 5 widely-used datasets show that our proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.

 <dc:title>Hegemonic structure of basic, clinical and patented knowledge on Ebola
  research: a US army reductionist initiative</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Background: In this paper, we present an approach to understand how the
basic, clinical and patent knowledge on Ebola is organized and
intercommunicated and what leading factor could be shaping the evolution of the
knowledge translation process for this disease. Methodology: A combination of
citation network analysis; analysis of Medical heading Subject (MeSH) and Gene
Ontology (GO) terms, and quantitative content analysis for patents and
scientific literature, aimed to map the organization of Ebola research was
carried out. Results: We found six putative research fronts (i.e. clusters of
high interconnected papers). Three research fronts are basic research on Ebola
virus structural proteins: glycoprotein, VP40 and VP35, respectively. There is
a fourth research front of basic research papers on pathogenesis, which is the
organizing hub of Ebola research. A fifth research front is pre-clinical
research focused on vaccines and glycoproteins. Finally, a
clinical-epidemiology research front related to the disease outbreaks was
identified. The network structure of patent families shows that the dominant
design is the use of Ebola virus proteins as targets of vaccines and other
immunological treatments. Therefore, patents network organization resembles the
organization of the scientific literature. Specifically, the knowledge on Ebola
would flow from higher (clinical-epidemiology) to intermediated
(cellular-tissular pathogenesis) to lower (molecular interactions) levels of
organization. Conclusion: Our results suggest a strong reductionist approach
for Ebola research probably influenced by the lethality of the disease. On the
other hand, the ownership profile of the patent families network and the main
researches relationship with the United State Army suggest a strong involvement
of this military institution in Ebola research.

 <dc:description>  Mean-payoff games on timed automata are played on the infinite weighted graph
of configurations of priced timed automata between two players, Player Min and
Player Max, by moving a token along the states of the graph to form an infinite
run. The goal of Player Min is to minimize the limit average weight of the run,
while the goal of the Player Max is the opposite. Brenguier, Cassez, and Raskin
recently studied a variation of these games and showed that mean-payoff games
are undecidable for timed automata with five or more clocks. We refine this
result by proving the undecidability of mean-payoff games with three clocks. On
a positive side, we show the decidability of mean-payoff games on one-clock
timed automata with binary price-rates. A key contribution of this paper is the
application of dynamic programming based proof techniques applied in the
context of average reward optimization on an uncountable state and action
space.

 <dc:description>  Nonlocal patch-based methods, in particular the Bayes' approach of Lebrun,
Buades and Morel (2013), are considered as state-of-the-art methods for
denoising (color) images corrupted by white Gaussian noise of moderate
variance. This paper is the first attempt to generalize this technique to
manifold-valued images. Such images, for example images with phase or
directional entries or with values in the manifold of symmetric positive
definite matrices, are frequently encountered in real-world applications.
Generalizing the normal law to manifolds is not canonical and different
attempts have been considered. Here we focus on a straightforward intrinsic
model and discuss the relation to other approaches for specific manifolds. We
reinterpret the Bayesian approach of Lebrun et al. (2013) in terms of minimum
mean squared error estimation, which motivates our definition of a
corresponding estimator on the manifold. With this estimator at hand we present
a nonlocal patch-based method for the restoration of manifold-valued images.
Various proof of concept examples demonstrate the potential of the proposed
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  This work presents a new toolkit for describing the acoustic properties of
the ocean environment before, during and after a sound event caused by an
underwater seismic air-gun. The toolkit uses existing sound measures, but
uniquely applies these to capture the early time period (actual pulse) and late
time period (reverberation and multiple arrivals). In total, 183 features are
produced for each air-gun sound. This toolkit was utilized on data retrieved
from a field deployment encompassing five marine autonomous recording units
during a 46-day seismic air-gun survey in Baffin Bay, Greenland. Using this
toolkit, a total of 147 million data points were identified from the Greenland
deployment recordings. The feasibility of extracting a large number of features
was then evaluated using two separate methods: a serial computer and a high
performance system. Results indicate that data extraction performance took an
estimated 216 hours for the serial system, and 18 hours for the high
performance computer. This paper provides an analytical description of the new
toolkit along with details for using it to identify relevant data.

 <dc:description>  Model checking probabilistic CTL properties of Markov decision processes with
convex uncertainties has been recently investigated by Puggelli et al. Such
model checking algorithms typically suffer from the state space explosion. In
this paper, we address probabilistic bisimulation to reduce the size of such an
MDP while preserving the probabilistic CTL properties it satisfies. In
particular, we discuss the key ingredients to build up the operations of
parallel composition for composing interval MDP components at run-time. More
precisely, we investigate how the parallel composition operator for interval
MDPs can be defined so as to arrive at a congruence closure. As a result, we
show that probabilistic bisimulation for interval MDPs is congruence with
respect to two facets of parallelism, namely synchronous product and
interleaving.

 <dc:description>  Influence diagrams provide a compact graphical representation of decision
problems. Several algorithms for the quick computation of their associated
expected utilities are available in the literature. However, often they rely on
a full quantification of both probabilistic uncertainties and utility values.
For problems where all random variables and decision spaces are finite and
discrete, here we develop a symbolic way to calculate the expected utilities of
influence diagrams that does not require a full numerical representation.
Within this approach expected utilities correspond to families of polynomials.
After characterizing their polynomial structure, we develop an efficient
symbolic algorithm for the propagation of expected utilities through the
diagram and provide an implementation of this algorithm using a computer
algebra system. We then characterize many of the standard manipulations of
influence diagrams as transformations of polynomials. We also generalize the
decision analytic framework of these diagrams by defining asymmetries as
operations over the expected utility polynomials.

 <dc:description>  One of the most widely studied problem in mining and analysis of complex
networks is the detection of community structures. The problem has been
extensively studied by researchers due to its high utility and numerous
applications in various domains. Many algorithmic solutions have been proposed
for the community detection problem but the quest to find the best algorithm is
still on. More often than not, researchers focus on developing fast and
accurate algorithms that can be generically applied to networks from a variety
of domains without taking into consideration the structural and topological
variations in these networks.
  In this paper, we evaluate the performance of different clustering algorithms
as a function of varying network topology. Along with the well known LFR model
to generate benchmark networks with communities,we also propose a new model
named Naive Scale Free Model to study the behavior of community detection
algorithms with respect to different topological features. More specifically,
we are interested in the size of networks, the size of community structures,
the average connectivity of nodes and the ratio of inter-intra cluster edges.
Results reveal several limitations of the current popular network clustering
algorithms failing to correctly find communities. This suggests the need to
revisit the design of current clustering algorithms that fail to incorporate
varying topological features of different networks.

 <dc:title>Optimal Channel Sensing Strategy for Cognitive Radio Networks with
  Heavy-Tailed Idle Times</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sengottuvelan, Senthilmurugan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Venkatesh, T. G.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In Cognitive Radio Network (CRN), the secondary user (SU) opportunistically
access the wireless channels whenever they are free from the licensed / Primary
User (PU). Even after occupying the channel, the SU has to sense the channel
intermittently to detect reappearance of PU, so that it can stop its
transmission and avoid interference to PU. Frequent channel sensing results in
the degradation of SU's throughput whereas sparse sensing increases the
interference experienced by the PU. Thus, optimal sensing interval policy plays
a vital role in CRN. In the literature, optimal channel sensing strategy has
been analysed for the case when the ON-OFF time distributions of PU are
exponential. However, the analysis of recent spectrum measurement traces
reveals that PU exhibits heavy-tailed idle times which can be approximated well
with Hyper-exponential distribution (HED). In our work, we deduce the structure
of optimal sensing interval policy for channels with HED OFF times through
Markov Decision Process (MDP). We then use dynamic programming framework to
derive sub-optimal sensing interval policies. A new Multishot sensing interval
policy is proposed and it is compared with existing policies for its
performance in terms of number of channel sensing and interference to PU.

 <dc:description>  Computing at the exascale level is expected to be affected by a significantly
higher rate of faults, due to increased component counts as well as power
considerations. Therefore, current day numerical algorithms need to be
reexamined as to determine if they are fault resilient, and which critical
operations need to be safeguarded in order to obtain performance that is close
to the ideal fault-free method.
  In a previous paper, a framework for the analysis of random stationary linear
iterations was presented and applied to the two grid method. The present work
is concerned with the multigrid algorithm for the solution of linear systems of
equations, which is widely used on high performance computing systems. It is
shown that the Fault-Prone Multigrid Method is not resilient, unless the
prolongation operation is protected. Strategies for fault detection and
mitigation as well as protection of the prolongation operation are presented
and tested, and a guideline for an optimal choice of parameters is devised.

 <dc:description>  Context: Software performance is a critical non-functional requirement,
appearing in many fields such as mission critical applications, financial, and
real time systems. In this work we focused on early detection of performance
bugs; our software under study was a real time system used in the
advertisement/marketing domain.
  Goal: Find a simple and easy to implement solution, predicting performance
bugs.
  Method: We built several models using four machine learning methods, commonly
used for defect prediction: C4.5 Decision Trees, Na\&quot;{\i}ve Bayes, Bayesian
Networks, and Logistic Regression.
  Results: Our empirical results show that a C4.5 model, using lines of code
changed, file's age and size as explanatory variables, can be used to predict
performance bugs (recall=0.73, accuracy=0.85, and precision=0.96). We show that
reducing the number of changes delivered on a commit, can decrease the chance
of performance bug injection.
  Conclusions: We believe that our approach can help practitioners to eliminate
performance bugs early in the development cycle. Our results are also of
interest to theoreticians, establishing a link between functional bugs and
(non-functional) performance bugs, and explicitly showing that attributes used
for prediction of functional bugs can be used for prediction of performance
bugs.

 <dc:description>  Computer systems today must meet and maintain service availability,
performance, and security requirements. Each of these demands requires
redundancy and some form of isolation. When service requirements are
implemented separately, the system architecture cannot easily share common
components of redundancy and isolation. We will present these service traits
collectively as cyber resilience with a system called Self Cleansing Intrusion
Tolerance or SCIT. Further, we will demonstrate that SCIT provides an effective
resilient cloud implementation making cost effective utilization of cloud
excess capacity and economies of scale. Lastly, we will introduce the notion of
serverless applications utilizing AWS Lambda and how a stateless architecture
can drastically reduce operational costs by utilizing cloud function services.

 <dc:description>  Whereas contemporary Error Correcting Codes (ECC) designs occupy a
significant fraction of total die area in chip-multiprocessors (CMPs),
approaches to deal with the vulnerability increase of CMP architecture against
Single Event Upsets (SEUs) and Multi-Bit Upsets (MBUs) are sought. In this
paper, we focus on reliability assessment of multithreaded applications running
on CMPs to propose an adaptive application-relevant architecture design to
accommodate the impact of both SEUs and MBUs in the entire CMP architecture.
This work concentrates on leveraging the intrinsic soft-error-immunity feature
of Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) as an alternative for SRAM-based storage
and operation components. We target a specific portion of working set for
reallocation to improve the reliability level of the CMP architecture design. A
selected portion of instructions in multithreaded program which experience high
rate of referencing with the lowest memory modification are ideal candidate to
be stored and executed in STT-RAM based components. We argue about why we
cannot use STT-RAM for the global storage and operation counterparts and
describe the obtained resiliency compared to the baseline setup. In addition, a
detail study of the impact of SEUs and MBUs on multithreaded programs will be
presented in the Appendix.

 <dc:description>  The humanoid robot iCub is a research platform of the Fondazione Istituto
Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), spread among different institutes around the
world. In the most recent version of iCub, the robot is equipped with stronger
legs and bigger feet, allowing it to perform balancing and walking motions that
were not possible with the first generations. Despite the new legs hardware,
walking has been rarely performed on the iCub robot. In this work the objective
is to implement walking motions on the robot, from which we want to analyze its
walking capabilities. We developed software modules based on extensions of
classic techniques such as the ZMP based pattern generator and position control
to identify which are the characteristics as well as limitations of the robot
against different walking tasks in order to give the users a reference of the
performance of the robot. Most of the experiments have been performed with
HeiCub, a reduced version of iCub without arms and head.

 <dc:title>Fine-To-Coarse Global Registration of RGB-D Scans</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  RGB-D scanning of indoor environments is important for many applications,
including real estate, interior design, and virtual reality. However, it is
still challenging to register RGB-D images from a hand-held camera over a long
video sequence into a globally consistent 3D model. Current methods often can
lose tracking or drift and thus fail to reconstruct salient structures in large
environments (e.g., parallel walls in different rooms). To address this
problem, we propose a &quot;fine-to-coarse&quot; global registration algorithm that
leverages robust registrations at finer scales to seed detection and
enforcement of new correspondence and structural constraints at coarser scales.
To test global registration algorithms, we provide a benchmark with 10,401
manually-clicked point correspondences in 25 scenes from the SUN3D dataset.
During experiments with this benchmark, we find that our fine-to-coarse
algorithm registers long RGB-D sequences better than previous methods.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Locally repairable codes (LRC) have recently been a subject of intense
research due to theoretical appeal and their application in distributed storage
systems. In an LRC, any coordinate of a codeword can be recovered by accessing
only few other coordinates. For LRCs over small alphabet (such as binary), the
optimal rate-distance trade-off is unknown. In this paper we provide the
tightest known upper bound on the rate of linear LRCs of a given relative
distance, an improvement over any previous result, in particular

 <dc:title>Statistical Properties of Sanitized Results from Differentially Private

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  Protection of individual privacy is a common concern when releasing and
sharing data and information. Differential privacy (DP) formalizes privacy in
probabilistic terms without making assumptions about the background knowledge
of data intruders, and thus provides a robust concept for privacy protection.
Practical applications of DP involve development of differentially private
mechanisms to generate sanitized results at a pre-specified privacy budget. In
the sanitization of bounded statistics such as proportions and correlation
coefficients, the bounding constraints will need to be incorporated in the
differentially private mechanisms. There has been little work in examining the
consequences of the incorporation of of bounding constraints on the accuracy of
sanitized results and the statistical inferences based on the sanitized results
from a differentially private mechanism. In this paper, we define
noninformative bounding procedures and formalize the differentially private
truncated and boundary inflated truncated (BIT) mechanisms for releasing
statistics with bounding constraints. The impacts of the noninformative
truncated and BIT Laplace mechanisms on the statistical accuracy and utility of
sanitized statistics, including bias, asymptotic consistency, and mean squared
error, are evaluated both theoretically and empirically via simulation studies.
We also provided an upper bound for the mean squared error between the
sanitized and original results for definite $n$ in the truncated Laplace and
BIT Laplace mechanism; the bound goes to 0 if the scale parameter goes to 0 as
$n\rightarrow\infty$.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a novel method to increase the spatial resolution of
depth images. We combine a deep fully convolutional network with a non-local
variational method in a deep primal-dual network. The joint network computes a
noise-free, high-resolution estimate from a noisy, low-resolution input depth
map. Additionally, a high-resolution intensity image is used to guide the
reconstruction in the network. By unrolling the optimization steps of a
first-order primal-dual algorithm and formulating it as a network, we can train
our joint method end-to-end. This not only enables us to learn the weights of
the fully convolutional network, but also to optimize all parameters of the
variational method and its optimization procedure. The training of such a deep
network requires a large dataset for supervision. Therefore, we generate
high-quality depth maps and corresponding color images with a physically based
renderer. In an exhaustive evaluation we show that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Molecular communication (MC) is a bio-inspired communication method based on
the exchange of molecules for information transfer among nanoscale devices.
Although MC has been extensively studied from various aspects, limitations
imposed by the physical design of transceiving units have been largely
neglected in the literature. Recently, we have proposed a nanobioelectronic MC
receiver architecture based on the nanoscale field effect transistor-based
biosensor (bioFET) technology, providing noninvasive and sensitive molecular
detection at nanoscale while producing electrical signals at the output. In
this paper, we derive analytical closed-form expressions for the capacity and
capacity-achieving input distribution for a memoryless MC channel with a
silicon nanowire (SiNW) FET-based MC receiver. The resulting expressions could
be used to optimize the information flow in MC systems equipped with
nanobioelectronic receivers.

 <dc:title>Towards Predictable Real-Time Performance on Multi-Core Platforms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kim, Hyoseung</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate sensing, computing, communication and
actuation capabilities to monitor and control operations in the physical
environment. A key requirement of such systems is the need to provide
predictable real-time performance: the timing correctness of the system should
be analyzable at design time with a quantitative metric and guaranteed at
runtime with high assurance. This requirement of predictability is particularly
important for safety-critical domains such as automobiles, aerospace, defense,
manufacturing and medical devices.
  The work in this dissertation focuses on the challenges arising from the use
of modern multi-core platforms in CPS. Even as of today, multi-core platforms
are rarely used in safety-critical applications primarily due to the temporal
interference caused by contention on various resources shared among processor
cores, such as caches, memory buses, and I/O devices. Such interference is hard
to predict and can significantly increase task execution time, e.g., up to 12x
on commodity quad-core platforms. To address the problem of ensuring timing
predictability on multi-core platforms, we develop novel analytical and systems
techniques in this dissertation. Our proposed techniques theoretically bound
temporal interference that tasks may suffer from when accessing shared
resources. Our techniques also involve software primitives and algorithms for
real-time operating systems and hypervisors, which significantly reduce the
degree of the temporal interference. Specifically, we tackle the issues of
cache and memory contention, locking and synchronization, interrupt handling,
and access control for computational accelerators such as GPGPUs, all of which
are crucial to achieving predictable real-time performance on a modern
multi-core platform.

 <dc:description>  Each day, approximately 500 missing persons cases occur that go
unsolved/unresolved in the United States. The non-profit organization known as
the Find Me Group (FMG), led by former law enforcement professionals, is
dedicated to solving or resolving these cases. This paper introduces the
Missing Person Intelligence Synthesis Toolkit (MIST) which leverages a
data-driven variant of geospatial abductive inference. This system takes search
locations provided by a group of experts and rank-orders them based on the
probability assigned to areas based on the prior performance of the experts
taken as a group. We evaluate our approach compared to the current practices
employed by the Find Me Group and found it significantly reduces the search
area - leading to a reduction of 31 square miles over 24 cases we examined in
our experiments. Currently, we are using MIST to aid the Find Me Group in an
active missing person case.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present an operational system for cyber threat intelligence
gathering from various social platforms on the Internet particularly sites on
the darknet and deepnet. We focus our attention to collecting information from
hacker forum discussions and marketplaces offering products and services
focusing on malicious hacking. We have developed an operational system for
obtaining information from these sites for the purposes of identifying emerging
cyber threats. Currently, this system collects on average 305 high-quality
cyber threat warnings each week. These threat warnings include information on
newly developed malware and exploits that have not yet been deployed in a
cyber-attack. This provides a significant service to cyber-defenders. The
system is significantly augmented through the use of various data mining and
machine learning techniques. With the use of machine learning models, we are
able to recall 92% of products in marketplaces and 80% of discussions on forums
relating to malicious hacking with high precision. We perform preliminary
analysis on the data collected, demonstrating its application to aid a security
expert for better threat analysis.

 <dc:description>  We propose a weakly-supervised framework for action labeling in video, where
only the order of occurring actions is required during training time. The key
challenge is that the per-frame alignments between the input (video) and label
(action) sequences are unknown during training. We address this by introducing
the Extended Connectionist Temporal Classification (ECTC) framework to
efficiently evaluate all possible alignments via dynamic programming and
explicitly enforce their consistency with frame-to-frame visual similarities.
This protects the model from distractions of visually inconsistent or
degenerated alignments without the need of temporal supervision. We further
extend our framework to the semi-supervised case when a few frames are sparsely
annotated in a video. With less than 1% of labeled frames per video, our method
is able to outperform existing semi-supervised approaches and achieve
comparable performance to that of fully supervised approaches.

 <dc:description>  Selectional restrictions are semantic constraints on forming certain complex
types in natural language. The paper gives an overview of modeling selectional
restrictions in a relational type system with morphological and syntactic
types. We discuss some foundations of the system and ways of formalizing
selectional restrictions.
  Keywords: type theory, selectional restrictions, syntax, morphology

 <dc:description>  Different kinds of random walks have proven to be useful in the study of
structural properties of complex networks. Among them, the restricted dynamics
of self-avoiding random walks (SAW), which visit only at most once each vertex
in the same walk, has been successfully used in network exploration. The
detection of communities of strongly connected vertices in networks remains an
open problem, despite its importance, due to the high computational complexity
of the associated optimization problem and the lack of a unique formal
definition of communities. In this work, we propose a SAW-based method to
extract the community distribution of a network and show that it achieves high
modularity scores, specially for real-world networks. We combine SAW with
principal component analysis to define the dissimilarity measure to be used for
agglomerative hierarchical clustering. To evaluate the performance of this
method we compare it with four popular methods for community detection:
Girvan-Newman, Fastgreedy, Walktrap and Infomap using two types of synthetic
networks and six well-known real-world cases.

 <dc:title>Attribute Learning for Network Intrusion Detection</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Network intrusion detection is one of the most visible uses for Big Data
analytics. One of the main problems in this application is the constant rise of
new attacks. This scenario, characterized by the fact that not enough labeled
examples are available for the new classes of attacks is hardly addressed by
traditional machine learning approaches. New findings on the capabilities of
Zero-Shot learning (ZSL) approach makes it an interesting solution for this
problem because it has the ability to classify instances of unseen classes. ZSL
has inherently two stages: the attribute learning and the inference stage. In
this paper we propose a new algorithm for the attribute learning stage of ZSL.
The idea is to learn new values for the attributes based on decision trees
(DT). Our results show that based on the rules extracted from the DT a better
distribution for the attribute values can be found. We also propose an
experimental setup for the evaluation of ZSL on network intrusion detection
(NID).

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a programmable, energy-efficient and real-time object
detection accelerator using deformable parts models (DPM), with 2x higher
accuracy than traditional rigid body models. With 8 deformable parts detection,
three methods are used to address the high computational complexity:
classification pruning for 33x fewer parts classification, vector quantization
for 15x memory size reduction, and feature basis projection for 2x reduction of
the cost of each classification. The chip is implemented in 65nm CMOS
technology, and can process HD (1920x1080) images at 30fps without any off-chip
storage while consuming only 58.6mW (0.94nJ/pixel, 1168 GOPS/W). The chip has
two classification engines to simultaneously detect two different classes of
objects. With a tested high throughput of 60fps, the classification engines can
be time multiplexed to detect even more than two object classes. It is energy
scalable by changing the pruning factor or disabling the parts classification.

 <dc:description>  The giant $k$-core --- maximal connected subgraph of a network where each
node has at least $k$ neighbors --- is important in the study of phase
transitions and in applications of network theory. Unlike Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
graphs and other random networks where $k$-cores emerge discontinuously for
$k\ge 3$, we show that transitive linking (or triadic closure) leads to 3-cores
emerging through single or double phase transitions of both discontinuous and
continuous nature. We also develop a $k$-core calculation that includes
clustering and provides insights into how high-level connectivity emerges.

 <dc:description>  Linear models for control and motion generation of humanoid robots have
received significant attention in the past years, not only due to their well
known theoretical guarantees, but also because of practical computational
advantages. However, to tackle more challenging tasks and scenarios such as
locomotion on uneven terrain, a more expressive model is required. In this
paper, we are interested in contact interaction-centered motion optimization
based on the momentum dynamics model. This model is non-linear and non-convex;
however, we find a relaxation of the problem that allows us to formulate it as
a single convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) that can be
very efficiently optimized. Furthermore, experimental results suggest that this
relaxation is tight and therefore useful for multi-contact planning. This
convex model is then coupled to the optimization of end-effector contacts
location using a mixed integer program, which can be solved in realtime. This
becomes relevant e.g. to recover from external pushes, where a predefined
stepping plan is likely to fail and an online adaptation of the contact
location is needed. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated in several
multi-contact scenarios for humanoid robot.

of node-based network analysis by edge-based characteristics. Following a
theoretical introduction and mathematical motivation, we apply the proposed
network-analytic methods to static and dynamic complex networks and compare the

of applications for data mining, including denoising and clustering of

 <dc:description>  Markerless motion capture algorithms require a 3D body with properly
personalized skeleton dimension and/or body shape and appearance to
successfully track a person. Unfortunately, many tracking methods consider
model personalization a different problem and use manual or semi-automatic
model initialization, which greatly reduces applicability. In this paper, we
propose a fully automatic algorithm that jointly creates a rigged actor model
commonly used for animation - skeleton, volumetric shape, appearance, and
optionally a body surface - and estimates the actor's motion from multi-view
video input only. The approach is rigorously designed to work on footage of
general outdoor scenes recorded with very few cameras and without background
subtraction. Our method uses a new image formation model with analytic
visibility and analytically differentiable alignment energy. For
reconstruction, 3D body shape is approximated as Gaussian density field. For
pose and shape estimation, we minimize a new edge-based alignment energy
inspired by volume raycasting in an absorbing medium. We further propose a new
statistical human body model that represents the body surface, volumetric
Gaussian density, as well as variability in skeleton shape. Given any
multi-view sequence, our method jointly optimizes the pose and shape parameters
of this model fully automatically in a spatiotemporal way.

 <dc:description>  As robots aspire for long-term autonomous operations in complex dynamic
environments, the ability to reliably take mission-critical decisions in
ambiguous situations becomes critical. This motivates the need to build systems
that have situational awareness to assess how qualified they are at that moment
to make a decision. We call this self-evaluating capability as introspection.
In this paper, we take a small step in this direction and propose a generic
framework for introspective behavior in perception systems. Our goal is to
learn a model to reliably predict failures in a given system, with respect to a
task, directly from input sensor data. We present this in the context of
vision-based autonomous MAV flight in outdoor natural environments, and show
that it effectively handles uncertain situations.

 <dc:description>  Network science is a powerful tool for analyzing complex systems in fields
ranging from sociology to engineering to biology. This paper is focused on
generative models of large-scale bipartite graphs, also known as two-way graphs
or two-mode networks. We propose two generative models that can be easily tuned
to reproduce the characteristics of real-world networks, not just
qualitatively, but quantitatively. The characteristics we consider are the
degree distributions and the metamorphosis coefficient. The metamorphosis
coefficient, a bipartite analogue of the clustering coefficient, is the
proportion of length-three paths that participate in length-four cycles. Having
a high metamorphosis coefficient is a necessary condition for close-knit
community structure. We define edge, node, and degreewise metamorphosis
coefficients, enabling a more detailed understanding of the bipartite
connectivity that is not explained by degree distribution alone. Our first
model, bipartite Chung-Lu (CL), is able to reproduce real-world degree
distributions, and our second model, bipartite block two-level Erd\&quot;os-R\'enyi
(BTER), reproduces both the degree distributions as well as the degreewise
metamorphosis coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these models on
several real-world data sets.

 <dc:title>A Density-Based Approach to the Retrieval of Top-K Spatial Textual

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Keyword-based web queries with local intent retrieve web content that is
relevant to supplied keywords and that represent points of interest that are
near the query location. Two broad categories of such queries exist. The first
encompasses queries that retrieve single spatial web objects that each satisfy
the query arguments. Most proposals belong to this category. The second
category, to which this paper's proposal belongs, encompasses queries that
support exploratory user behavior and retrieve sets of objects that represent
regions of space that may be of interest to the user. Specifically, the paper
proposes a new type of query, namely the top-k spatial textual clusters (k-STC)
query that returns the top-k clusters that (i) are located the closest to a
given query location, (ii) contain the most relevant objects with regard to
given query keywords, and (iii) have an object density that exceeds a given
threshold. To compute this query, we propose a basic algorithm that relies on
on-line density-based clustering and exploits an early stop condition. To
improve the response time, we design an advanced approach that includes three
techniques: (i) an object skipping rule, (ii) spatially gridded posting lists,
and (iii) a fast range query algorithm. An empirical study on real data
demonstrates that the paper's proposals offer scalability and are capable of
excellent performance.

 <dc:title>Computing minimum cuts in hypergraphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chekuri, Chandra</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study algorithmic and structural aspects of connectivity in hypergraphs.
Given a hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ with $n = |V|$, $m = |E|$ and $p = \sum_{e \in E}
|e|$ the best known algorithm to compute a global minimum cut in $H$ runs in
time $O(np)$ for the uncapacitated case and in $O(np + n^2 \log n)$ time for
the capacitated case. We show the following new results.
  1. Given an uncapacitated hypergraph $H$ and an integer $k$ we describe an
algorithm that runs in $O(p)$ time to find a subhypergraph $H'$ with sum of
degrees $O(kn)$ that preserves all edge-connectivities up to $k$ (a
$k$-sparsifier). This generalizes the corresponding result of Nagamochi and
Ibaraki from graphs to hypergraphs. Using this sparsification we obtain an $O(p
+ \lambda n^2)$ time algorithm for computing a global minimum cut of $H$ where
$\lambda$ is the minimum cut value.
  2. We generalize Matula's argument for graphs to hypergraphs and obtain a
$(2+\epsilon)$-approximation to the global minimum cut in a capacitated
hypergraph in $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon} (p \log n + n \log^2 n))$ time.
  3. We show that a hypercactus representation of all the global minimum cuts
of a capacitated hypergraph can be computed in $O(np + n^2 \log n)$ time and
$O(p)$ space.
  We utilize vertex ordering based ideas to obtain our results. Unlike graphs
we observe that there are several different orderings for hypergraphs which
yield different insights.

 <dc:description>  Human trafficking is among the most challenging law enforcement problems
which demands persistent fight against from all over the globe. In this study,
we leverage readily available data from the website &quot;Backpage&quot;-- used for
classified advertisement-- to discern potential patterns of human trafficking
activities which manifest online and identify most likely trafficking related
advertisements. Due to the lack of ground truth, we rely on two human analysts
--one human trafficking victim survivor and one from law enforcement, for
hand-labeling the small portion of the crawled data. We then present a
semi-supervised learning approach that is trained on the available labeled and
unlabeled data and evaluated on unseen data with further verification of
experts.

 <dc:description>  Most of the existing methods for bilingual word embedding only consider
shallow context or simple co-occurrence information. In this paper, we propose
a latent bilingual sense unit (Bilingual Sense Clique, BSC), which is derived
from a maximum complete sub-graph of pointwise mutual information based graph
over bilingual corpus. In this way, we treat source and target words equally
and a separated bilingual projection processing that have to be used in most
existing works is not necessary any more. Several dimension reduction methods
are evaluated to summarize the BSC-word relationship. The proposed method is
evaluated on bilingual lexicon translation tasks and empirical results show
that bilingual sense embedding methods outperform existing bilingual word
embedding methods.

 <dc:description>  Although more additional corpora are now available for Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT), only the ones which belong to the same or similar domains
with the original corpus can indeed enhance SMT performance directly. Most of
the existing adaptation methods focus on sentence selection. In comparison,
phrase is a smaller and more fine grained unit for data selection, therefore we
propose a straightforward and efficient connecting phrase based adaptation
method, which is applied to both bilingual phrase pair and monolingual n-gram
adaptation. The proposed method is evaluated on IWSLT/NIST data sets, and the
results show that phrase based SMT performance are significantly improved (up
to +1.6 in comparison with phrase based SMT baseline system and +0.9 in
comparison with existing methods).

 <dc:description>  In the task of community detection, there often exists some useful prior
information. In this paper, a Semi-supervised clustering approach using a new
Evidential Label Propagation strategy (SELP) is proposed to incorporate the
domain knowledge into the community detection model. The main advantage of SELP
is that it can take limited supervised knowledge to guide the detection
process. The prior information of community labels is expressed in the form of
mass functions initially. Then a new evidential label propagation rule is
adopted to propagate the labels from labeled data to unlabeled ones. The
outliers can be identified to be in a special class. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of SELP.

 <dc:description>  Limited angle problem is a challenging issue in x-ray computed tomography
(CT) field. Iterative reconstruction methods that utilize the additional prior
can suppress artifacts and improve image quality, but unfortunately require
increased computation time. An interesting way is to restrain the artifacts in
the images reconstructed from the practical filtered back projection (FBP)
method. Frikel and Quinto have proved that the streak artifacts in FBP results
could be characterized. It indicates that the artifacts created by FBP method
have specific and similar characteristics in a stationary limited-angle
scanning configuration. Based on this understanding, this work aims at
developing a method to extract and suppress specific artifacts of FBP
reconstructions for limited-angle tomography. A data-driven learning-based
method is proposed based on a deep convolutional neural network. An end-to-end
mapping between the FBP and artifact-free images is learned and the implicit
features involving artifacts will be extracted and suppressed via nonlinear
mapping. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations of experimental results
indicate that the proposed method show a stable and prospective performance on
artifacts reduction and detail recovery for limited angle tomography. The
presented strategy provides a simple and efficient approach for improving image
quality of the reconstruction results from limited projection data.

 <dc:description>  Though the method of least squares has been used for a long time in solving
signal processing problems, in the recent field of sparse recovery from
compressed measurements, this method has not been given much attention. In this
paper we show that a method in the least squares family, known in the
literature as Orthogonal Least Squares (OLS), adapted for compressed recovery
problems, has competitive recovery performance and computation complexity, that
makes it a suitable alternative to popular greedy methods like Orthogonal
Matching Pursuit (OMP). We show that with a slight modification, OLS can
exactly recover a $K$-sparse signal, embedded in an $N$ dimensional space
($K&lt;&lt;N$) in $M=\mathcal{O}(K\log (N/K))$ no of measurements with Gaussian
dictionaries. We also show that OLS can be easily implemented in such a way
that it requires $\mathcal{O}(KMN)$ no of floating point operations similar to
that of OMP. In this paper performance of OLS is also studied with sensing
matrices with correlated dictionary, in which algorithms like OMP does not
exhibit good recovery performance. We study the recovery performance of OLS in
a specific dictionary called \emph{generalized hybrid dictionary}, which is
shown to be a correlated dictionary, and show numerically that OLS has is far
superior to OMP in these kind of dictionaries in terms of recovery performance.
Finally we provide analytical justifications that corroborate the findings in
the numerical illustrations.

 <dc:description>  This paper explores the suitability of using automatically discovered topics
from MOOC discussion forums for modelling students' academic abilities. The
Rasch model from psychometrics is a popular generative probabilistic model that
relates latent student skill, latent item difficulty, and observed student-item
responses within a principled, unified framework. According to scholarly
educational theory, discovered topics can be regarded as appropriate
measurement items if (1) students' participation across the discovered topics
is well fit by the Rasch model, and if (2) the topics are interpretable to
subject-matter experts as being educationally meaningful. Such Rasch-scaled
topics, with associated difficulty levels, could be of potential benefit to
curriculum refinement, student assessment and personalised feedback. The
technical challenge that remains, is to discover meaningful topics that
simultaneously achieve good statistical fit with the Rasch model. To address
this challenge, we combine the Rasch model with non-negative matrix
factorisation based topic modelling, jointly fitting both models. We
demonstrate the suitability of our approach with quantitative experiments on
data from three Coursera MOOCs, and with qualitative survey results on topic
interpretability on a Discrete Optimisation MOOC.

 <dc:title>Cognitive Science in the era of Artificial Intelligence: A roadmap for
  reverse-engineering the infant language-learner</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  During their first years of life, infants learn the language(s) of their
environment at an amazing speed despite large cross cultural variations in
amount and complexity of the available language input. Understanding this
simple fact still escapes current cognitive and linguistic theories. Recently,
spectacular progress in the engineering science, notably, machine learning and
wearable technology, offer the promise of revolutionizing the study of
cognitive development. Machine learning offers powerful learning algorithms
that can achieve human-like performance on many linguistic tasks. Wearable
sensors can capture vast amounts of data, which enable the reconstruction of
the sensory experience of infants in their natural environment. The project of
'reverse engineering' language development, i.e., of building an effective
system that mimics infant's achievements appears therefore to be within reach.
Here, we analyze the conditions under which such a project can contribute to
our scientific understanding of early language development. We argue that
instead of defining a sub-problem or simplifying the data, computational models
should address the full complexity of the learning situation, and take as input
the raw sensory signals available to infants. This implies that (1) accessible
but privacy-preserving repositories of home data be setup and widely shared,
and (2) models be evaluated at different linguistic levels through a benchmark
of psycholinguist tests that can be passed by machines and humans alike, (3)
linguistically and psychologically plausible learning architectures be scaled
up to real data using probabilistic/optimization principles from machine
learning. We discuss the feasibility of this approach and present preliminary
results.

 <dc:description>  The vanilla attention-based neural machine translation has achieved promising
performance because of its capability in leveraging varying-length source
annotations. However, this model still suffers from failures in long sentence
translation, for its incapability in capturing long-term dependencies. In this
paper, we propose a novel recurrent neural machine translation (RNMT), which
not only preserves the ability to model varying-length source annotations but
also better captures long-term dependencies. Instead of the conventional
attention mechanism, RNMT employs a recurrent neural network to extract the
context vector, where the target-side previous hidden state serves as its
initial state, and the source annotations serve as its inputs. We refer to this
new component as contexter. As the encoder, contexter and decoder in our model
are all derivable recurrent neural networks, our model can still be trained
end-to-end on large-scale corpus via stochastic algorithms. Experiments on
Chinese-English translation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model to
attention-based neural machine translation, especially on long sentences.
Besides, further analysis of the contexter revels that our model can implicitly
reflect the alignment to source sentence.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a multi-contact walking pattern generator based on preview-control
of the 3D acceleration of the center of mass (COM). A key point in the design
of our algorithm is the calculation of contact-stability constraints. Thanks to
a mathematical observation on the algebraic nature of the frictional wrench
cone, we show that the 3D volume of feasible COM accelerations is a always a
downward-pointing cone. We reduce its computation to a convex hull of (dual) 2D
points, for which optimal O(n log n) algorithms are readily available. This
reformulation brings a significant speedup compared to previous methods, which
allows us to compute time-varying contact-stability criteria fast enough for
the control loop. Next, we propose a conservative trajectory-wide
contact-stability criterion, which can be derived from COM-acceleration volumes
at marginal cost and directly applied in a model-predictive controller. We
finally implement this pipeline and exemplify it with the HRP-4 humanoid model
in multi-contact dynamically walking scenarios.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we consider a two-level hierarchical MIMO antenna array system,
where each antenna of the upper level is made up of a subarray on the lower
one. The concept of spatial multiplexing is applied twice in this situation:
Firstly, the spatial multiplexing of a Line-of-Sight (LoS) MIMO system is
exploited. It is based on appropriate (sub-)array distances and achieves
multiplexing gain due to phase differences among the signals at the receive
(sub-)arrays. Secondly, one or more additional reflected paths of different
angles (separated from the LoS path by different spatial beams at the
subarrays) are used to exploit spatial multiplexing between paths.
  By exploiting the above two multiplexing kinds simultaneously, a high
dimensional system with maximum spatial multiplexing is proposed by jointly
using 'phase differences' within paths and 'angular differences' between paths.
The system includes an advanced hybrid beamforming architecture with large
subarray separation, which could occur in millimeter wave backhaul scenarios.
The possible gains of the system w.r.t. a pure LOS MIMO system are illustrated
by evaluating the capacities with total transmit power constraints.

 <dc:description>  We analyse bill cosponsorship networks in the Italian Chamber of Deputies. In
comparison with other parliaments, a distinguishing feature of the Chamber is
the large number of political groups. Our analysis aims to infer the pattern of
collaborations between these groups from data on bill cosponsorships. We
propose an extension of stochastic block models for edge-valued graphs and
derive measures of group productivity and of collaboration between political
parties. As the model proposed encloses a large number of parameters, we pursue
a penalized likelihood approach that enables us to infer a sparse reduced graph
displaying collaborations between political parties.

 <dc:title>A flow based pruning scheme for enumerative equitable coloring

 <dc:description>  An equitable graph coloring is a proper vertex coloring of a graph G where
the sizes of the color classes differ by at most one. The equitable chromatic
number is the smallest number k such that G admits such equitable k-coloring.
We focus on enumerative algorithms for the computation of the equitable
coloring number and propose a general scheme to derive pruning rules for them:
We show how the extendability of a partial coloring into an equitable coloring
can be modeled via network flows. Thus, we obtain pruning rules which can be
checked via flow algorithms. Computational experiments show that the search
tree of enumerative algorithms can be significantly reduced in size by these
rules and, in most instances, such naive approach even yields a faster
algorithm. Moreover, the stability, i.e., the number of solved instances within
a given time limit, is greatly improved.
  Since the execution of flow algorithms at each node of a search tree is time
consuming, we derive arithmetic pruning rules (generalized Hall-conditions)
from the network model. Adding these rules to an enumerative algorithm yields
an even larger runtime improvement.

 <dc:description>  Current state of the art object recognition architectures achieve impressive
performance but are typically specialized for a single depictive style (e.g.
photos only, sketches only). In this paper, we present SwiDeN : our
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which recognizes objects
regardless of how they are visually depicted (line drawing, realistic shaded
drawing, photograph etc.). In SwiDeN, we utilize a novel `deep' depictive
style-based switching mechanism which appropriately addresses the
depiction-specific and depiction-invariant aspects of the problem. We compare
SwiDeN with alternative architectures and prior work on a 50-category Photo-Art
dataset containing objects depicted in multiple styles. Experimental results
show that SwiDeN outperforms other approaches for the depiction-invariant
object recognition problem.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, both the amount of cyberattacks and their sophistication have
considerably increased, and their prevention is of concern of most of
organizations. Cooperation by means of information sharing is a promising
strategy to address this problem, but unfortunately it poses many challenges.
Indeed, looking for a win-win environment is not straightforward and
organizations are not properly motivated to share information. This work
presents a model to analyse the benefits and drawbacks of information sharing
among organizations that presents a certain level of dependency. The proposed
model applies functional dependency network analysis to emulate attacks
propagation and game theory for information sharing management. We present a
simulation framework implementing the model that allows for testing different
sharing strategies under several network and attack settings. Experiments using
simulated environments show how the proposed model provides insights on which
conditions and scenarios are beneficial for information sharing.

 <dc:description>  Reaction delays play an important role in determining the qualitative
dynamical properties of a platoon of vehicles driving on a straight road. In
this paper, we investigate the impact of delayed feedback on the dynamics of
the Classical Car-Following Model (CCFM). Specifically, we analyze the CCFM in
three regimes -- no delay, small delay and arbitrary delay. The
control-theoretic analyses for no-delay and small-delay regimes yield a
sufficient condition for local stability of the CCFM. Next, we derive the
necessary and sufficient condition for local stability of the CCFM for an
arbitrary delay. We then demonstrate that the transition of traffic flow from
the locally stable to the unstable regime occurs via a Hopf bifurcation.
  In the context of self-driven vehicles, designing control algorithms that
avoid jerky vehicular movements is essential. Hence, we derive the necessary
and sufficient condition for non-oscillatory convergence of the CCFM, thus
ensuring smooth traffic flow and good ride quality. Next, we characterize the
rate of convergence of the CCFM, and bring forth the interplay between
non-oscillatory convergence and the rate of convergence of the CCFM.
  Qualitatively, since a Hopf bifurcation results in the emergence of limit
cycles, we characterize the type of the Hopf bifurcation and the asymptotic
orbital stability of the limit cycles using Poincar\'{e} normal forms and the
center manifold theory. These limit cycles manifest as back-propagating
congestion waves. The analysis is complemented with stability charts,
bifurcation diagrams and MATLAB simulations.

(OFDM) systems employing radio frequency (RF) pilot tone phase noise
cancellation the influence of laser phase noise is evaluated. Novel analytical
results for the common phase error and for the (modulation dependent) inter
carrier interference are evaluated based upon Gaussian statistics for the laser
phase noise. In the evaluation it is accounted for that the laser phase noise
is filtered in the correlation signal detection. Numerical results are
presented for OFDM systems with 4 and 16 PSK modulation, 200 OFDM bins and baud
rate of 1 GS/s. It is found that about 225 km transmission is feasible for the
coherent 4PSK-OFDM system over normal (G.652) fiber.

 <dc:title>Submodular Secretary Problems: Cardinality, Matching, and Linear
  Constraints</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kesselheim, Thomas</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study various generalizations of the secretary problem with submodular
objective functions. Generally, a set of requests is revealed step-by-step to
an algorithm in random order. For each request, one option has to be selected
so as to maximize a monotone submodular function while ensuring feasibility.
For our results, we assume that we are given an offline algorithm computing an
$\alpha$-approximation for the respective problem. This way, we separate
computational limitations from the ones due to the online nature. When only
focusing on the online aspect, we can assume $\alpha = 1$.
  In the submodular secretary problem, feasibility constraints are cardinality
constraints. That is, out of a randomly ordered stream of entities, one has to
select a subset size $k$. For this problem, we present a
$0.31\alpha$-competitive algorithm for all $k$, which asymptotically reaches
competitive ratio $\frac{\alpha}{e}$ for large $k$. In submodular secretary
matching, one side of a bipartite graph is revealed online. Upon arrival, each
node has to be matched permanently to an offline node or discarded irrevocably.
We give an $\frac{\alpha}{4}$-competitive algorithm. In both cases, we improve
over previously best known competitive ratios, using a generalization of the
algorithm for the classic secretary problem.
  Furthermore, we give an $O(\alpha d^{-\frac{2}{B-1}})$-competitive algorithm
for submodular function maximization subject to linear packing constraints.
Here, $d$ is the column sparsity, that is the maximal number of none-zero
entries in a column of the constraint matrix, and $B$ is the minimal capacity
of the constraints. Notably, this bound is independent of the total number of
constraints. We improve the algorithm to be $O(\alpha
d^{-\frac{1}{B-1}})$-competitive if both $d$ and $B$ are known to the algorithm
beforehand.

 <dc:description>  We consider the algorithmic problem of generating each subset of
$[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ whose size is in some interval $[k,l]$, $0\leq k\leq
l\leq n$, exactly once (cyclically) by repeatedly adding or removing a single
element, or by exchanging a single element. For $k=0$ and $l=n$ this is the
classical problem of generating all $2^n$ subsets of $[n]$ by element
additions/removals, and for $k=l$ this is the classical problem of generating
all $\binom{n}{k}$ subsets of $[n]$ by element exchanges. We prove the
existence of such cyclic minimum-change enumerations for a large range of
values $n$, $k$, and $l$, improving upon and generalizing several previous
results. For all these existential results we provide optimal algorithms to
compute the corresponding Gray codes in constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time per
generated set and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space. Rephrased in terms of graph theory,
our results establish the existence of (almost) Hamilton cycles in the subgraph
of the $n$-dimensional cube $Q_n$ induced by all levels $[k,l]$. We reduce all
remaining open cases to a generalized version of the middle levels conjecture,
which asserts that the subgraph of $Q_{2k+1}$ induced by all levels
$[k-c,k+1+c]$, $c\in\{0,1,\ldots,k\}$, has a Hamilton cycle. We also prove an
approximate version of this generalized conjecture, showing that this graph has
a cycle that visits a $(1-o(1))$-fraction of all vertices.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we explore the problem of identifying substitute relationship
between food pairs from real-world food consumption data as the first step
towards the healthier food recommendation. Our method is inspired by the
distributional hypothesis in linguistics. Specifically, we assume that foods
that are consumed in similar contexts are more likely to be similar dietarily.
For example, a turkey sandwich can be considered a suitable substitute for a
chicken sandwich if both tend to be consumed with french fries and salad. To
evaluate our method, we constructed a real-world food consumption dataset from
MyFitnessPal's public food diary entries and obtained ground-truth human
judgements of food substitutes from a crowdsourcing service. The experiment
results suggest the effectiveness of the method in identifying suitable
substitutes.

 <dc:title>Adapting polytopes dimension for managing degrees of freedom in

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In tolerancing analysis, geometrical or contact specifications can be
represented by polytopes. Due to the degrees of invariance of surfaces and that
of freedom of joints, these operand polytopes are originally unbounded in most
of the cases (i.e. polyhedra). Homri et al. proposed the introduction of
virtual boundaries (called cap half-spaces) over the unbounded displacements of
each polyhedron to turn them into 6-polytopes. This decision was motivated by
the complexity that operating on polyhedra in R6 supposes. However, that
strategy has to face the multiplication of the number of cap half-spaces during
the computation of Minkowski sums. In general, the time for computing cap
facets is greater than for computing facets representing real limits of bounded
displacements. In order to deal with that, this paper proposes the use of the
theory of screws to determine the set of displacements that defines the
positioning of one surface in relation to another. This set of displacements
defines the subspace of R6 in which the polytopes of the respective surfaces
have to be projected and operated to avoid calculating facets and vertices
along the directions of unbounded displacements. With this new strategy it is
possible to decrease the complexity of the Minkowski sums by reducing the
dimension of the operands and consequently reducing the computation time. An
example illustrates the method and shows the time reduction during the
computations.

parameter learning as a low-rank symmetric tensor estimation problem, which we
solve by multi-convex optimization. We demonstrate our approach on regression

Mediterranean diet is scientifically known as a healthy diet that helps to
prevent many metabolic diseases. In particular, our work focuses on the
recognition of Mediterranean food and dishes. The development of this
methodology would allow to analise the daily habits of users with wearable
cameras, within the topic of lifelogging. By using automatic mechanisms we
could build an objective tool for the analysis of the patient's behaviour,
allowing specialists to discover unhealthy food patterns and understand the
user's lifestyle.
  With the aim to automatically recognize a complete diet, we introduce a
challenging multi-labeled dataset related to Mediterranean diet called FoodCAT.
The first type of label provided consists of 115 food classes with an average
of 400 images per dish, and the second one consists of 12 food categories with
an average of 3800 pictures per class. This dataset will serve as a basis for
the development of automatic diet recognition. In this context, deep learning
and more specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), currently are
state-of-the-art methods for automatic food recognition. In our work, we
compare several architectures for image classification, with the purpose of
diet recognition. Applying the best model for recognising food categories, we
achieve a top-1 accuracy of 72.29\%, and top-5 of 97.07\%. In a complete diet
recognition of dishes from Mediterranean diet, enlarged with the Food-101
dataset for international dishes recognition, we achieve a top-1 accuracy of
68.07\%, and top-5 of 89.53\%, for a total of 115+101 food classes.

 <dc:description>  We study a Gaussian matrix function of the adjacency matrix of artificial and
real-world networks. In particular, we study the Gaussian Estrada index---an
index characterizing the importance of eigenvalues close to zero. This index
accounts for the information contained in the eigenvalues close to zero in the
spectra of networks. Here we obtain bounds for this index in simple graphs,
proving that it reaches its maximum for star graphs followed by complete
bipartite graphs. We also obtain formulas for the Estrada Gaussian index of
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs as well as for the Barab\'asi-Albert graphs. We
also show that in real-world networks this index is related to the existence of
important structural patterns, such as complete bipartite subgraphs
(bicliques). Such bicliques appear naturally in many real-world networks as a
consequence of the evolutionary processes giving rise to them. In general, the
Gaussian matrix function of the adjacency matrix of networks characterizes
important structural information not described in previously used matrix
functions of graphs.

 <dc:title>Predicting Anchor Links between Heterogeneous Social Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  People usually get involved in multiple social networks to enjoy new services
or to fulfill their needs. Many new social networks try to attract users of
other existing networks to increase the number of their users. Once a user
(called source user) of a social network (called source network) joins a new
social network (called target network), a new inter-network link (called anchor
link) is formed between the source and target networks. In this paper, we
concentrated on predicting the formation of such anchor links between
heterogeneous social networks. Unlike conventional link prediction problems in
which the formation of a link between two existing users within a single
network is predicted, in anchor link prediction, the target user is missing and
will be added to the target network once the anchor link is created. To solve
this problem, we use meta-paths as a powerful tool for utilizing heterogeneous
information in both the source and target networks. To this end, we propose an
effective general meta-path-based approach called Connector and Recursive
Meta-Paths (CRMP). By using those two different categories of meta-paths, we
model different aspects of social factors that may affect a source user to join
the target network, resulting in the formation of a new anchor link. Extensive
experiments on real-world heterogeneous social networks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method against the recent methods.

 <dc:description>  There is considerable interest in the task of automatically generating image
captions. However, evaluation is challenging. Existing automatic evaluation
metrics are primarily sensitive to n-gram overlap, which is neither necessary
nor sufficient for the task of simulating human judgment. We hypothesize that
semantic propositional content is an important component of human caption
evaluation, and propose a new automated caption evaluation metric defined over
scene graphs coined SPICE. Extensive evaluations across a range of models and
datasets indicate that SPICE captures human judgments over model-generated
captions better than other automatic metrics (e.g., system-level correlation of
0.88 with human judgments on the MS COCO dataset, versus 0.43 for CIDEr and
0.53 for METEOR). Furthermore, SPICE can answer questions such as `which
caption-generator best understands colors?' and `can caption-generators count?'

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of downlink training and channel estimation in
frequency division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO systems, where the base station
(BS) equipped with a large number of antennas serves a number of single-antenna
users simultaneously. To obtain the channel state information (CSI) at the BS
in FDD systems, the downlink channel has to be estimated by users via downlink
training and then fed back to the BS. For FDD large-scale MIMO systems, the
overhead for downlink training and CSI uplink feedback could be prohibitively
high, which presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we study the
behavior of the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimator when the channel
covariance matrix has a low-rank or an approximate low-rank structure. Our
theoretical analysis reveals that the amount of training overhead can be
substantially reduced by exploiting the low-rank property of the channel
covariance matrix. In particular, we show that the MMSE estimator is able to
achieve exact channel recovery in the asymptotic low-noise regime, provided
that the number of pilot symbols in time is no less than the rank of the
channel covariance matrix. We also present an optimal pilot design for the
single-user case, and an asymptotic optimal pilot design for the multi-user
scenario. Lastly, we develop a simple model-based scheme to estimate the
channel covariance matrix, based on which the MMSE estimator can be employed to
estimate the channel. The proposed scheme does not need any additional training
overhead. Simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical results and
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimated covariance-assisted MMSE
estimator.

 <dc:description>  In the last decades, the applications of power inverter increased rapidly. As
a result, in spite of rectifier, an inverter with a high-power electronic
oscillator has capability to convert direct current (DC) into alternating
current (AC) in different forms. In this paper, a new fuzzy logic control (FLC)
is suggested to an improved modeling inverter of a single-phase voltage source
using LC filter and voltage sensor. Moreover, two sliding and fuzzy modes of
non-linear voltage inverter controller are simulated and compared. The results
proved the high efficiency and performance of the proposed method while reduce
total harmonic distortion (THD) under linear loading conditions as well. All
the data are applied on emergency power supply (EPS).

 <dc:title>A Unified Approach for Beam-to-Beam Contact</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Existing beam contact formulations can be categorized in point contact models
that consider a discrete contact force at the closest point of the beams, and
line contact models that assume distributed contact forces. In this work, it
will be shown that line contact formulations provide accurate and robust
mechanical models in the range of small contact angles, whereas the
computational efficiency considerably decreases with increasing contact angles.
On the other hand, point contact formulations serve as sufficiently accurate
and very efficient models in the regime of large contact angles, while they are
not applicable for small contact angles as a consequence of non-unique closest
point projections. In order to combine the advantages of these basic
formulations, a novel all-angle beam contact (ABC) formulation is developed
that applies a point contact formulation for large contact angles and a
recently developed line contact formulation for small contact angles, the two
being smoothly connected by means of a variationally consistent model
transition. Based on a stringent analysis, two different transition laws are
investigated, optimal algorithmic parameters are suggested and conservation of
energy and momentum is shown. All configuration-dependent quantities are
consistently linearized, thus allowing for their application within implicit
time integration schemes. Furthermore, a step size control of the nonlinear
solution scheme that allows for large displacement increments per time step and
an efficient two-stage contact search based on dynamically adapted search
segments are proposed. A series of numerical test cases is analyzed in order to
verify the accuracy and consistency of the proposed contact model transition
regarding contact force distributions and conservation properties, but also for
quantifying the efficiency gains as compared to standard beam contact
formulations.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by applications to data networks where fast convergence is
essential, we analyze the problem of learning in generic N-person games that
admit a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies. Specifically, we consider a
scenario where players interact repeatedly and try to learn from past
experience by small adjustments based on local - and possibly imperfect -
payoff information. For concreteness, we focus on the so-called &quot;hedge&quot; variant
of the exponential weights algorithm where players select an action with
probability proportional to the exponential of the action's cumulative payoff
over time. When players have perfect information on their mixed payoffs, the
algorithm converges locally to a strict equilibrium and the rate of convergence
is exponentially fast - of the order of
$\mathcal{O}(\exp(-a\sum_{j=1}^{t}\gamma_{j}))$ where $a&gt;0$ is a constant and
$\gamma_{j}$ is the algorithm's step-size. In the presence of uncertainty,
convergence requires a more conservative step-size policy, but with high
probability, the algorithm remains locally convergent and achieves an
exponential convergence rate.

 <dc:description>  The DLVHEX system implements the HEX-semantics, which integrates answer set
programming (ASP) with arbitrary external sources. Since its first release ten
years ago, significant advancements were achieved. Most importantly, the
exploitation of properties of external sources led to efficiency improvements
and flexibility enhancements of the language, and technical improvements on the
system side increased user's convenience. In this paper, we present the current
status of the system and point out the most important recent enhancements over
early versions. While existing literature focuses on theoretical aspects and
specific components, a bird's eye view of the overall system is missing. In
order to promote the system for real-world applications, we further present
applications which were already successfully realized on top of DLVHEX. This
paper is under consideration for acceptance in Theory and Practice of Logic
Programming.

 <dc:description>  We report on an exploratory project aimed at performing immersive 3D
visualization of astronomical data, starting with spectral-line radio data
cubes from galaxies. This work is done as a collaboration between the
Department of Physics and Astronomy and the Department of Computer Science at
the University of Manitoba. We are building our prototype using the 3D engine
Unity, because of its ease of use for integration with advanced displays such
as a CAVE environment, a zSpace tabletop, or virtual reality headsets. We
address general issues regarding 3D visualization, such as: load and convert
astronomy data, perform volume rendering on the GPU, and produce physically
meaningful visualizations using principles of visual literacy. We discuss some
challenges to be met when designing a user interface that allows us to take
advantage of this new way of exploring data. We hope to lay the foundations for
an innovative framework useful for all astronomers who use spectral line data
cubes, and encourage interested parties to join our efforts. This pilot project
addresses the challenges presented by frontier astronomy experiments, such as
the Square Kilometre Array and its precursors.

 <dc:description>  As data science continues to grow in popularity, there will be an increasing
need to make data science tools more scalable, flexible, and accessible. In
particular, automated machine learning (AutoML) systems seek to automate the
process of designing and optimizing machine learning pipelines. In this
chapter, we present a genetic programming-based AutoML system called TPOT that
optimizes a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning models with
the goal of maximizing classification accuracy on a supervised classification
problem. Further, we analyze a large database of pipelines that were previously
used to solve various supervised classification problems and identify 100 short
series of machine learning operations that appear the most frequently, which we
call the building blocks of machine learning pipelines. We harness these
building blocks to initialize TPOT with promising solutions, and find that this
sensible initialization method significantly improves TPOT's performance on one
benchmark at no cost of significantly degrading performance on the others.
Thus, sensible initialization with machine learning pipeline building blocks
shows promise for GP-based AutoML systems, and should be further refined in
future work.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes our approach on Query Word Labeling as an attempt in the
shared task on Mixed Script Information Retrieval at Forum for Information
Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) 2015. The query is written in Roman script and the
words were in English or transliterated from Indian regional languages. A total
of eight Indian languages were present in addition to English. We also
identified the Named Entities and special symbols as part of our task. A CRF
based machine learning framework was used for labeling the individual words
with their corresponding language labels. We used a dictionary based approach
for language identification. We also took into account the context of the word
while identifying the language. Our system demonstrated an overall accuracy of
75.5% for token level language identification. The strict F-measure scores for
the identification of token level language labels for Bengali, English and
Hindi are 0.7486, 0.892 and 0.7972 respectively. The overall weighted F-measure
of our system was 0.7498.

 <dc:description>  Authorship attribution, being an important problem in many areas in-cluding
information retrieval, computational linguistics, law and journalism etc., has
been identified as a subject of increasingly research interest in the re-cent
years. In case of Author Identification task in PAN at CLEF 2015, the main
focus was given on cross-genre and cross-topic author verification tasks. We
have used several word-based and style-based features to identify the
dif-ferences between the known and unknown problems of one given set and label
the unknown ones accordingly using a Random Forest based classifier.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a study on personalized emphasis framing which can
be used to tailor the content of a message to enhance its appeal to different
individuals. With this framework, we directly model content selection decisions
based on a set of psychologically-motivated domain-independent personal traits
including personality (e.g., extraversion and conscientiousness) and basic
human values (e.g., self-transcendence and hedonism). We also demonstrate how
the analysis results can be used in automated personalized content selection
for persuasive message generation.

 <dc:description>  Discrete energy minimization is widely-used in computer vision and machine
learning for problems such as MAP inference in graphical models. The problem,
in general, is notoriously intractable, and finding the global optimal solution
is known to be NP-hard. However, is it possible to approximate this problem
with a reasonable ratio bound on the solution quality in polynomial time? We
show in this paper that the answer is no. Specifically, we show that general
energy minimization, even in the 2-label pairwise case, and planar energy
minimization with three or more labels are exp-APX-complete. This finding rules
out the existence of any approximation algorithm with a sub-exponential
approximation ratio in the input size for these two problems, including
constant factor approximations. Moreover, we collect and review the
computational complexity of several subclass problems and arrange them on a
complexity scale consisting of three major complexity classes -- PO, APX, and
exp-APX, corresponding to problems that are solvable, approximable, and
inapproximable in polynomial time. Problems in the first two complexity classes
can serve as alternative tractable formulations to the inapproximable ones.
This paper can help vision researchers to select an appropriate model for an
application or guide them in designing new algorithms.

non-trivial phase diagram determined by the competition of the leading terms of
the two processes. We test our results against numerical simulations, and
compare the analytical predictions with an empirical dataset finding good
agreements between them. The presented framework can be used to classify the
dynamical features of real social networks and to gather new insights about the
effects of social dynamics on ongoing spreading processes.

 <dc:description>  When faced with a supervised learning problem, we hope to have rich enough
data to build a model that predicts future instances well. However, in
practice, problems can exhibit predictive heterogeneity: most instances might
be relatively easy to predict, while others might be predictive outliers for
which a model trained on the entire dataset does not perform well. Identifying
these can help focus future data collection. We present gLOP, the global and
Local Penalty, a framework for capturing predictive heterogeneity and
identifying predictive outliers. gLOP is based on penalized regression for
multitask learning, which improves learning by leveraging training signal
information from related tasks. We give two optimization algorithms for gLOP,
one space-efficient, and another giving the full regularization path. We also
characterize uniqueness in terms of the data and tuning parameters, and present
empirical results on synthetic data and on two health research problems.

 <dc:description>  This work examines a stochastic formulation of the generalized Nash
equilibrium problem (GNEP) where agents are subject to randomness in the
environment of unknown statistical distribution. We focus on fully-distributed
online learning by agents and employ penalized individual cost functions to
deal with coupled constraints. Three stochastic gradient strategies are
developed with constant step-sizes. We allow the agents to use heterogeneous
step-sizes and show that the penalty solution is able to approach the Nash
equilibrium in a stable manner within $O(\mu_\text{max})$, for small step-size
value $\mu_\text{max}$ and sufficiently large penalty parameters. The operation
of the algorithm is illustrated by considering the network Cournot competition
problem.

 <dc:description>  Systems of linear equations arise at the heart of many scientific and
engineering applications. Many of these linear systems are sparse; i.e., most
of the elements in the coefficient matrix are zero. Direct methods based on
matrix factorizations are sometimes needed to ensure accurate solutions. For
example, accurate solution of sparse linear systems is needed in shift-invert
Lanczos to compute interior eigenvalues. The performance and resource usage of
sparse matrix factorizations are critical to time-to-solution and maximum
problem size solvable on a given platform. In many applications, the
coefficient matrices are symmetric, and exploiting symmetry will reduce both
the amount of work and storage cost required for factorization. When the
factorization is performed on large-scale distributed memory platforms,
communication cost is critical to the performance of the algorithm. At the same
time, network topologies have become increasingly complex, so that modern
platforms exhibit a high level of performance variability. This makes
scheduling of computations an intricate and performance-critical task. In this
paper, we investigate the use of an asynchronous task paradigm, one-sided
communication and dynamic scheduling in implementing sparse Cholesky
factorization (symPACK) on large-scale distributed memory platforms. Our solver
symPACK relies on efficient and flexible communication primitives provided by
the UPC++ library. Performance evaluation shows good scalability and that
symPACK outperforms state-of-the-art parallel distributed memory factorization
packages, validating our approach on practical cases.

 <dc:description>  Face recognition has been an active research area in the past few decades. In
general, face recognition can be very challenging due to variations in
viewpoint, illumination, facial expression, etc. Therefore it is essential to
extract features which are invariant to some or all of these variations. Here a
new image representation, called scattering transform/network, has been used to
extract features from faces. The scattering transform is a kind of
convolutional network which provides a powerful multi-layer representation for
signals. After extraction of scattering features, PCA is applied to reduce the
dimensionality of the data and then a multi-class support vector machine is
used to perform recognition. The proposed algorithm has been tested on three
face datasets and achieved a very high recognition rate.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a parallel block-based Viterbi decoder (PBVD) on
the graphic processing unit (GPU) platform for the decoding of convolutional
codes. The decoding procedure is simplified and parallelized, and the
characteristic of the trellis is exploited to reduce the metric computation.
Based on the compute unified device architecture (CUDA), two kernels with
different parallelism are designed to map two decoding phases. Moreover, the
optimal design of data structures for several kinds of intermediate information
are presented, to improve the efficiency of internal memory transactions.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed decoder achieves high
throughput of 598Mbps on NVIDIA GTX580 and 1802Mbps on GTX980 for the 64-state
convolutional code, which are 1.5 times speedup compared to the existing
fastest works on GPUs.

 <dc:title>Octopus: A Cooperative Hierarchical Caching Strategy for Cloud Radio
  Access Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tran, Tuyen X.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Pompili, Dario</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, implementing Radio Access Network (RAN) functionalities on
cloud-based computing platform has become an emerging solution that leverages
the many advantages of cloud infrastructure, such as shared computing resources
and storage capacity, while lowering the operational cost. In this paper, we
propose a novel caching framework aimed at fully exploiting the potential of
such Cloud-based RAN (C-RAN) systems through cooperative hierarchical caching
which minimizes the network costs of content delivery and improves users'
Quality of Experience (QoE). In particular, we consider the cloud-cache in the
cloud processing unit (CPU) as a new layer in the RAN cache hierarchy, bridging
the capacity-performance gap between the traditional edge-based and core-based
caching schemes. A delay cost model is introduced to characterize and formulate
the cache placement optimization problem, which is shown to be NP-complete. As
such, a low complexity, heuristic cache management strategy is proposed,
constituting of a proactive cache distribution algorithm and a reactive cache
replacement algorithm. Extensive numerical simulations are carried out using
both real-world YouTube video requests and synthetic content requests. It is
demonstrated that our proposed Octopus caching strategy significantly
outperforms the traditional caching strategies in terms of cache hit ratio,
average content access delay and backhaul traffic load.

 <dc:description>  We develop a unified and systematic framework for performing online
nonnegative matrix factorization under a wide variety of important divergences.
The online nature of our algorithm makes it particularly amenable to
large-scale data. We prove that the sequence of learned dictionaries converges
almost surely to the set of critical points of the expected loss function. We
do so by leveraging the theory of stochastic approximations and projected
dynamical systems. This result substantially generalizes the previous results
obtained only for the squared-$\ell_2$ loss. Moreover, the novel techniques
involved in our analysis open new avenues for analyzing similar matrix
factorization problems. The computational efficiency and the quality of the
learned dictionary of our algorithm are verified empirically on both synthetic
and real datasets. In particular, on the tasks of topic learning, shadow
removal and image denoising, our algorithm achieves superior trade-offs between
the quality of learned dictionary and running time over the batch and other
online NMF algorithms.

 <dc:description>  A fundamental challenge in synthesis from examples is designing a learning
algorithm that poses the minimal number of questions to an end user while
guaranteeing that the target hypothesis is discovered. Such guarantees are
practically important because they ensure that end users will not be
overburdened with unnecessary questions.
  We present SPEX -- a learning algorithm that addresses the above challenge.
SPEX considers the hypothesis space of formulas over first-order predicates and
learns the correct hypothesis by only asking the user simple membership queries
for concrete examples. Thus, SPEX is directly applicable to any learning
problem that fits its hypothesis space and uses membership queries.
  SPEX works by iteratively eliminating candidate hypotheses from the space
until converging to the target hypothesis. The main idea is to use the
implication order between hypotheses to guarantee that in each step the
question presented to the user obtains maximal pruning of the space. This
problem is particularly challenging when predicates are potentially correlated.
  To show that SPEX is practically useful, we expressed two rather different
applications domains in its framework: learning programs for the domain of
technical analysts (stock trading) and learning data structure specifications.
The experimental results show that SPEX's optimality guarantee is effective: it
drastically reduces the number of questions posed to the user while
successfully learning the exact hypothesis.

 <dc:description>  Although software analytics has experienced rapid growth as a research area,
it has not yet reached its full potential for wide industrial adoption. Most of
the existing work in software analytics still relies heavily on costly manual
feature engineering processes, and they mainly address the traditional
classification problems, as opposed to predicting future events. We present a
vision for \emph{DeepSoft}, an \emph{end-to-end} generic framework for modeling
software and its development process to predict future risks and recommend
interventions. DeepSoft, partly inspired by human memory, is built upon the
powerful deep learning-based Long Short Term Memory architecture that is
capable of learning long-term temporal dependencies that occur in software
evolution. Such deep learned patterns of software can be used to address a
range of challenging problems such as code and task recommendation and
prediction. DeepSoft provides a new approach for research into modeling of
source code, risk prediction and mitigation, developer modeling, and
automatically generating code patches from bug reports.

 <dc:description>  Service Function Chaining (SFC) is a crucial technology for future Internet.
It aims to overcome the limitation of current deployment models which is rigid
and static. Application of this technology relies on algorithms that can
optimally mapping SFC to substrate network. This category of algorithms is
referred as &quot;Service Function Chaining Resource Allocation (SFC-RA)&quot; algorithms
or &quot;VNF placement (VNFP)&quot; algorithms. This paper presents a survey of current
researches in SFC-RA algorithms. After presenting the formulation and related
problems, several variants of SFC-RA problem are summarized. At last, we
discussed several future research directions.

 <dc:description>  In this Paper, the effective capacity of a multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) system in two different cases with receive antenna selection (RAS) and
transmit antenna selection (TAS) schemes is investigated. A closed-form
solution for the maximum constant arrival rate of this network with statistical
delay quality of service (QoS) constraint is extracted in the quasi-static
fading channel. This study is conducted in two different cases. When channel
state information (CSI) is not available at the MIMO transmitter,
implementation of TAS is difficult. Therefore, RAS scheme is employed and one
antenna with the maximum instantaneous signal to noise ratio (SNR) is chosen at
the receiver. On the other hand, when CSI is available at the transmitter, TAS
scheme is executed. In this case one antenna is selected at the transmitter.
Moreover, an optimal power-control policy is applied to the selected antenna
and the effective capacity of the MIMO system is derived. Finally, this optimal
power adaptation and the effective capacity are investigated in two asymptotic
cases with the loose and strict QoS requirements. In particular, we show that
in the TAS scheme with the loose QoS restriction, the effective capacity
converges to the ergodic capacity. Then, an exact closed-form solution is
obtained for the ergodic capacity of the channel here.

 <dc:description>  [abridged] Context: Multidimensional arrays are used by many different
algorithms. As such, indexing and broadcasting complex operations over
multidimensional arrays are ubiquitous tasks and can be performance limiting.
Inquiry: Simultaneously indexing two or more multidimensional arrays with
different shapes (e.g., copying data from one tensor to another larger, zero
padded tensor in anticipation of a convolution) is difficult to do efficiently:
Hard-coded nested for loops in C, Fortran, and Go cannot be applied when the
dimension of a tensor is unknown at compile time. Likewise, boost::multi_array
cannot be used unless the dimensions of the array are known at compile time,
and the style of implementation restricts the user from using the index tuple
inside a vectorized operation (as would be required to compute an expected
value of a multidimensional distribution). On the other hand, iteration methods
that do not require the dimensionality or shape to be known at compile time
(e.g., incrementing and applying carry operations to index tuples or remapping
integer indices in the flat array), can be substantially slower than hard-coded
nested for loops. ... Importance: Manipulation of multidimensional arrays is a
common task in software, especially in high performance numerical methods. This
paper proposes a novel way to leverage template recursion to iterate over and
apply operations to multidimensional arrays, and then demonstrates the superior
performance and flexibility of operations that can be achieved using this new
approach.

 <dc:description>  Systems for symbolic event recognition infer occurrences of events in time
using a set of event definitions in the form of first-order rules. The Event
Calculus is a temporal logic that has been used as a basis in event recognition
applications, providing among others, direct connections to machine learning,
via Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). We present an ILP system for online
learning of Event Calculus theories. To allow for a single-pass learning
strategy, we use the Hoeffding bound for evaluating clauses on a subset of the
input stream. We employ a decoupling scheme of the Event Calculus axioms during
the learning process, that allows to learn each clause in isolation. Moreover,
we use abductive-inductive logic programming techniques to handle unobserved
target predicates. We evaluate our approach on an activity recognition
application and compare it to a number of batch learning techniques. We obtain
results of comparable predicative accuracy with significant speed-ups in
training time. We also outperform hand-crafted rules and match the performance
of a sound incremental learner that can only operate on noise-free datasets.
This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

 <dc:description>  One of the key obstacles in making learning protocols realistic in
applications is the need to supervise them, a costly process that often
requires hiring domain experts. We consider the framework to use the world
knowledge as indirect supervision. World knowledge is general-purpose
knowledge, which is not designed for any specific domain. Then the key
challenges are how to adapt the world knowledge to domains and how to represent
it for learning. In this paper, we provide an example of using world knowledge
for domain dependent document clustering. We provide three ways to specify the
world knowledge to domains by resolving the ambiguity of the entities and their
types, and represent the data with world knowledge as a heterogeneous
information network. Then we propose a clustering algorithm that can cluster
multiple types and incorporate the sub-type information as constraints. In the
experiments, we use two existing knowledge bases as our sources of world
knowledge. One is Freebase, which is collaboratively collected knowledge about
entities and their organizations. The other is YAGO2, a knowledge base
automatically extracted from Wikipedia and maps knowledge to the linguistic
knowledge base, WordNet. Experimental results on two text benchmark datasets
(20newsgroups and RCV1) show that incorporating world knowledge as indirect
supervision can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art clustering
algorithms as well as clustering algorithms enhanced with world knowledge
features.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we improve the attention or alignment accuracy of neural
machine translation by utilizing the alignments of training sentence pairs. We
simply compute the distance between the machine attentions and the &quot;true&quot;
alignments, and minimize this cost in the training procedure. Our experiments
on large-scale Chinese-to-English task show that our model improves both
translation and alignment qualities significantly over the large-vocabulary
neural machine translation system, and even beats a state-of-the-art
traditional syntax-based system.

 <dc:title>Segmentation of Soft atherosclerotic plaques using active contour models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jawaid, Muhammad Moazzam</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Detection of non-calcified plaques in the coronary tree is a challenging
problem due to the nature of comprising substances. Hard plaques are easily
discernible in CTA data cloud due to apparent bright behaviour, therefore many
approaches have been proposed for automatic segmentation of calcified plaques.
In contrast soft plaques show very small difference in intensity with respect
to surrounding heart tissues &amp; blood voxels. This similarity in intensity makes
the isolation and detection of soft plaques very difficult. This work aims to
develop framework for segmentation of vulnerable plaques with minimal user
dependency. In first step automatic seed point has been established based on
the fact that coronary artery behaves as tubular structure through axial
slices. In the following step the behaviour of contrast agent has been modelled
mathematically to reflect the dye diffusion in respective CTA volume.
Consequently based on detected seed point &amp; intensity behaviour, localized
active contour segmentation has been applied to extract complete coronary tree.
Bidirectional segmentation has been applied to avoid loss of coronary
information due to the seed point location whereas auto adjustment feature of
contour grabs new emerging branches. Medial axis for extracted coronary tree is
generated using fast marching method for obtaining curve planar reformation for
validation of contrast agent behaviour. Obtained coronary tree is to be
evaluated for soft plaques in second phase of this research.

make use of the basis vectors from a set of mutually unbiased bases, widely
studied in the field of quantum information processing, in the selection of
probing vectors $x$. This approach offers a new state of the art single shot
sampling variance while requiring only $O(\log(n))$ random bits to generate
each vector. This significantly improves on traditional methods such as
Hutchinson's and Gaussian estimators in terms of the number of random bits
required and worst case sample variance.

 <dc:description>  To meet the ever-increasing demands on higher throughput and better network
delay performance, 60 GHZ networking is proposed as a promising solution for
the next generation of wireless communications. To successfully deploy such
networks, its important to understand their performance first. However, due to
the unique fading characteristic of the 60 GHz channel, the characterization of
the corresponding service process, offered by the channel, using the
conventional methodologies may not be tractable. In this work, we provide an
alternative approach to derive a closed-form expression that characterizes the
cumulative service process of the 60 GHz channel in terms of the moment
generating function (MGF) of its instantaneous channel capacity. We then use
this expression to derive probabilistic upper bounds on the backlog and delay
that are experienced by a flow traversing this network, using results from the
MGF-based network calculus. The computed bounds are validated using simulation.
We provide numerical results for different networking scenarios and for
different traffic and channel parameters and we show that the 60 GHz wireless
network is capable of satisfying stringent quality-of-Service (QoS)
requirements, in terms of network delay and reliability. With this analysis
approach at hand, a larger scale 60 GHz network design and optimization is
possible.

 <dc:title>Improved Non-Malleable Extractors, Non-Malleable Codes and Independent
  Source Extractors</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Xin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we give improved constructions of several central objects in
the literature of randomness extraction and tamper-resilient cryptography. Our
main results are:
  (1) An explicit seeded non-malleable extractor with error $\epsilon$ and seed
length $d=O(\log n)+O(\log(1/\epsilon)\log \log (1/\epsilon))$, that supports
min-entropy $k=\Omega(d)$ and outputs $\Omega(k)$ bits. Combined with the
protocol in \cite{DW09}, this gives a two round privacy amplification protocol
with optimal entropy loss in the presence of an active adversary, for all
security parameters up to $\Omega(k/\log k)$.
  (2) An explicit non-malleable two-source extractor for min-entropy $k \geq
(1-\gamma)n$, some constant $\gamma&gt;0$, that outputs $\Omega(k)$ bits with
error $2^{-\Omega(n/\log n)}$. Combined with the connection in \cite{CG14b}
this gives a non-malleable code in the two-split-state model with relative rate
$\Omega(1/\log n)$. This exponentially improves previous constructions, all of
which only achieve rate $n^{-\Omega(1)}$.\footnote{The work of Aggarwal et. al
\cite{ADKO15} had a construction which &quot;achieves&quot; constant rate, but recently
the author found an error in their proof.}
  (3)A two-source extractor for min-entropy $O(\log n \log \log n)$, which also
implies a $K$-Ramsey graph on $N$ vertices with $K=(\log N)^{O(\log \log \log
N)}$. We also obtain a seeded non-malleable $9$-source extractor with optimal
seed length, which in turn gives a $10$-source extractor for min-entropy
$O(\log n)$. Previously the best known extractor for such min-entropy requires
$O(\log \log n)$ sources \cite{CohL16}.
  Independent of our work, Cohen \cite{Cohen16} obtained similar results to (1)
and the two-source extractor, except the dependence on $\epsilon$ is
$\log(1/\epsilon)(\log \log (1/\epsilon))^{O(1)}$ and the two-source extractor
requires min-entropy $\log n (\log \log n)^{O(1)}$.

 <dc:description>  Multimodal medical information processing is currently the epicenter of
intense interdisciplinary research, as proper data fusion may lead to more
accurate diagnoses. Moreover, multimodality may disambiguate cases of
co-morbidity. This paper presents a framework for retrieving, analyzing, and
storing medical information as a multilayer graph, an abstract format suitable
for data fusion and further processing. At the same time, this paper addresses
the need for reliable medical information through co-author graph ranking. A
use case pertaining to frailty based on Python and Neo4j serves as an
illustration of the proposed framework.

 <dc:description>  In this note, we extend the result of \cite{PoulyG16} about the complexity of
solving polynomial differential equations over unbounded domains to work with
non-rational input. In order to deal with arbitrary input, we phrase the result
in framework of Conputable Analysis \cite{Ko91}. As a side result, we also get
a uniform result about complexity of the operator, and not just about the
solution.

 <dc:description>  PSO is a widely recognized optimization algorithm inspired by social swarm.
In this brief we present a heterogeneous strategy particle swarm optimization
(HSPSO), in which a proportion of particles adopt a fully informed strategy to
enhance the converging speed while the rest are singly informed to maintain the
diversity. Our extensive numerical experiments show that HSPSO algorithm is
able to obtain satisfactory solutions, outperforming both PSO and the fully
informed PSO. The evolution process is examined from both structural and
microscopic points of view. We find that the cooperation between two types of
particles can facilitate a good balance between exploration and exploitation,
yielding better performance. We demonstrate the applicability of HSPSO on the
filter design problem.

 <dc:title>A Linear Algebraic Approach to Datalog Evaluation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sato, Taisuke</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new approach to Datalog evaluation.
Given a linear Datalog program DB written using N constants and binary
predicates, we first translate if-and-only-if completions of clauses in DB into
a set Eq(DB) of matrix equations with a non-linear operation where relations in
M_DB, the least Herbrand model of DB, are encoded as adjacency matrices. We
then translate Eq(DB) into another, but purely linear matrix equations
tilde_Eq(DB). It is proved that the least solution of tilde_Eq(DB) in the sense
of matrix ordering is converted to the least solution of Eq(DB) and the latter
gives M_DB as a set of adjacency matrices. Hence computing the least solution
of tilde_Eq(DB) is equivalent to computing M_DB specified by DB. For a class of
tail recursive programs and for some other types of programs, our approach
achieves O(N^3) time complexity irrespective of the number of variables in a
clause since only matrix operations costing O(N^3) or less are used.
  We conducted two experiments that compute the least Herbrand models of linear
Datalog programs. The first experiment computes transitive closure of
artificial data and real network data taken from the Koblenz Network
Collection. The second one compared the proposed approach with the
state-of-the-art symbolic systems including two Prolog systems and two ASP
systems, in terms of computation time for a transitive closure program and the
same generation program. In the experiment, it is observed that our linear
algebraic approach runs 10^1 ~ 10^4 times faster than the symbolic systems when
data is not sparse. To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming
(TPLP).

 <dc:description>  Due to its rapid development in the past decade, air transportation system
has attracted considerable research attention from diverse communities. While
most of the previous studies focused on airline networks, here we
systematically explore the robustness of the Chinese air route network, and
identify the vital edges which form the backbone of Chinese air transportation
system. Specifically, we employ a memetic algorithm to minimize the network
robustness after removing certain edges hence the solution of this model is the
set of vital edges. Counterintuitively, our results show that the most vital
edges are not necessarily the edges of highest topological importance, for
which we provide an extensive explanation from the microscope of view. Our
findings also offer new insights to understanding and optimizing other
real-world network systems.

Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering (PPGEE), the Electronics and
Information Research Centre (CETELI), and Samsung Eletr\^onica da Amaz\^onia
Ltda. (Samsung), which aims at training human resources for Samsung's research
and development (R&amp;D) areas. Inspired by co-operative education systems, this
collaboration offers an academic experience by means of a complementary
training programme (CTP), in order to train undergraduates and graduate
students in electrical and computer engineering, with especial emphasis on
digital television (TV), industrial automation, and mobile devices
technologies. In particular, this cooperation has provided scholarships for
students and financial support for professors and coordinators in addition to
the construction of a new building with new laboratories, classrooms, and staff
rooms, to assist all research and development activities. Additionally, the
cooperation outcomes led to applications developed for Samsung's mobile
devices, digital TV, and production processes, an increase of 37% in CETELI's
scientific production (i.e., conference and journal papers) as well as
professional training for undergraduates and graduate students.

 <dc:description>  Multi-task learning (MTL) is useful for domains in which data originates from
multiple sources that are individually under-sampled. MTL methods are able to
learn classification models that have higher performance as compared to
learning a single model by aggregating all the data together or learning a
separate model for each data source. The performance of these methods relies on
label accuracy. We address the problem of simultaneously learning multiple
classifiers in the MTL framework when the training data has imprecise labels.
We assume that there is an additional source of information that provides a
score for each instance which reflects the certainty about its label. Modeling
this score as being generated by an underlying ranking function, we augment the
MTL framework with an added layer of supervision. This results in new MTL
methods that are able to learn accurate classifiers while preserving the domain
structure provided through the rank information. We apply these methods to the
task of detecting abnormal cortical regions in the MRIs of patients suffering
from focal epilepsy whose MRI were read as normal by expert neuroradiologists.
In addition to the noisy labels provided by the results of surgical resection,
we employ the results of an invasive intracranial-EEG exam as an additional
source of label information. Our proposed methods are able to successfully
detect abnormal regions for all patients in our dataset and achieve a higher
performance as compared to baseline methods.

 <dc:title>Learning Tree-Structured Detection Cascades for Heterogeneous Networks

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a new approach to learning cascaded classifiers for
use in computing environments that involve networks of heterogeneous and
resource-constrained, low-power embedded compute and sensing nodes. We present
a generalization of the classical linear detection cascade to the case of
tree-structured cascades where different branches of the tree execute on
different physical compute nodes in the network. Different nodes have access to
different features, as well as access to potentially different computation and
energy resources. We concentrate on the problem of jointly learning the
parameters for all of the classifiers in the cascade given a fixed cascade
architecture and a known set of costs required to carry out the computation at
each node.To accomplish the objective of joint learning of all detectors, we
propose a novel approach to combining classifier outputs during training that
better matches the hard cascade setting in which the learned system will be
deployed. This work is motivated by research in the area of mobile health where
energy efficient real time detectors integrating information from multiple
wireless on-body sensors and a smart phone are needed for real-time monitoring
and delivering just- in-time adaptive interventions. We apply our framework to
two activity recognition datasets as well as the problem of cigarette smoking
detection from a combination of wrist-worn actigraphy data and respiration
chest band data.

 <dc:title>Localizing and Orienting Street Views Using Overhead Imagery</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vo, Nam</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Hays, James</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we aim to determine the location and orientation of a
ground-level query image by matching to a reference database of overhead (e.g.
satellite) images. For this task we collect a new dataset with one million
pairs of street view and overhead images sampled from eleven U.S. cities. We
explore several deep CNN architectures for cross-domain matching --
Classification, Hybrid, Siamese, and Triplet networks. Classification and
Hybrid architectures are accurate but slow since they allow only partial
feature precomputation. We propose a new loss function which significantly
improves the accuracy of Siamese and Triplet embedding networks while
maintaining their applicability to large-scale retrieval tasks like image
geolocalization. This image matching task is challenging not just because of
the dramatic viewpoint difference between ground-level and overhead imagery but
because the orientation (i.e. azimuth) of the street views is unknown making
correspondence even more difficult. We examine several mechanisms to match in
spite of this -- training for rotation invariance, sampling possible rotations
at query time, and explicitly predicting relative rotation of ground and
overhead images with our deep networks. It turns out that explicit orientation
supervision also improves location prediction accuracy. Our best performing
architectures are roughly 2.5 times as accurate as the commonly used Siamese
network baseline.

 <dc:description>  Community detection in networks is one of the most popular topics of modern
network science. Communities, or clusters, are usually groups of vertices
having higher probability of being connected to each other than to members of
other groups, though other patterns are possible. Identifying communities is an
ill-defined problem. There are no universal protocols on the fundamental
ingredients, like the definition of community itself, nor on other crucial
issues, like the validation of algorithms and the comparison of their
performances. This has generated a number of confusions and misconceptions,
which undermine the progress in the field. We offer a guided tour through the
main aspects of the problem. We also point out strengths and weaknesses of
popular methods, and give directions to their use.

 <dc:description>  Recently, sparse representation based visual tracking methods have attracted
increasing attention in the computer vision community. Although achieve
superior performance to traditional tracking methods, however, a basic problem
has not been answered yet --- that whether the sparsity constrain is really
needed for visual tracking? To answer this question, in this paper, we first
propose a robust non-sparse representation based tracker and then conduct
extensive experiments to compare it against several state-of-the-art sparse
representation based trackers. Our experiment results and analysis indicate
that the proposed non-sparse tracker achieved competitive tracking accuracy
with sparse trackers while having faster running speed, which support our
non-sparse tracker to be used in practical applications.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by the structural analogies between point lattices and linear
error-correcting codes, and by the mature theory on locally testable codes, we
initiate a systematic study of local testing for membership in lattices.
Testing membership in lattices is also motivated in practice, by applications
to integer programming, error detection in lattice-based communication, and
cryptography.
  Apart from establishing the conceptual foundations of lattice testing, our
results include the following:
  1. We demonstrate upper and lower bounds on the query complexity of local
testing for the well-known family of code formula lattices. Furthermore, we
instantiate our results with code formula lattices constructed from Reed-Muller
codes, and obtain nearly-tight bounds.
  2. We show that in order to achieve low query complexity, it is sufficient to
design one-sided non-adaptive canonical tests. This result is akin to, and
based on an analogous result for error-correcting codes due to Ben-Sasson et
al. (SIAM J. Computing 35(1) pp1-21).

 <dc:description>  Despite the great success of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for the
image classification task on datasets like Cifar and ImageNet, CNN's
representation power is still somewhat limited in dealing with object images
that have large variation in size and clutter, where Fisher Vector (FV) has
shown to be an effective encoding strategy. FV encodes an image by aggregating
local descriptors with a universal generative Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). FV
however has limited learning capability and its parameters are mostly fixed
after constructing the codebook. To combine together the best of the two
worlds, we propose in this paper a neural network structure with FV layer being
part of an end-to-end trainable system that is differentiable; we name our
network FisherNet that is learnable using backpropagation. Our proposed
FisherNet combines convolutional neural network training and Fisher Vector
encoding in a single end-to-end structure. We observe a clear advantage of
FisherNet over plain CNN and standard FV in terms of both classification
accuracy and computational efficiency on the challenging PASCAL VOC object
classification task.

 <dc:description>  Visual relationships capture a wide variety of interactions between pairs of
objects in images (e.g. &quot;man riding bicycle&quot; and &quot;man pushing bicycle&quot;).
Consequently, the set of possible relationships is extremely large and it is
difficult to obtain sufficient training examples for all possible
relationships. Because of this limitation, previous work on visual relationship
detection has concentrated on predicting only a handful of relationships.
Though most relationships are infrequent, their objects (e.g. &quot;man&quot; and
&quot;bicycle&quot;) and predicates (e.g. &quot;riding&quot; and &quot;pushing&quot;) independently occur
more frequently. We propose a model that uses this insight to train visual
models for objects and predicates individually and later combines them together
to predict multiple relationships per image. We improve on prior work by
leveraging language priors from semantic word embeddings to finetune the
likelihood of a predicted relationship. Our model can scale to predict
thousands of types of relationships from a few examples. Additionally, we
localize the objects in the predicted relationships as bounding boxes in the
image. We further demonstrate that understanding relationships can improve
content based image retrieval.

 <dc:title>New MDS codes with small sub-packetization and near-optimal repair

 <dc:description>  An $(n, M)$ vector code $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$ is a collection
of $M$ codewords where $n$ elements (from the field $\mathbb{F}$) in each of
the codewords are referred to as code blocks. Assuming that $\mathbb{F} \cong
\mathbb{B}^{\ell}$, the code blocks are treated as $\ell$-length vectors over
the base field $\mathbb{B}$. Equivalently, the code is said to have the
sub-packetization level $\ell$. This paper addresses the problem of
constructing MDS vector codes which enable exact reconstruction of each code
block by downloading small amount of information from the remaining code
blocks. The repair bandwidth of a code measures the information flow from the
remaining code blocks during the reconstruction of a single code block. This
problem naturally arises in the context of distributed storage systems as the
node repair problem [4]. Assuming that $M = |\mathbb{B}|^{k\ell}$, the repair
bandwidth of an MDS vector code is lower bounded by $\big(\frac{n - 1}{n -
k}\big)\cdot \ell$ symbols (over the base field $\mathbb{B}$) which is also
referred to as the cut-set bound [4]. For all values of $n$ and $k$, the MDS
vector codes that attain the cut-set bound with the sub-packetization level
$\ell = (n-k)^{\lceil{{n}/{(n-k)}}\rceil}$ are known in the literature [23,
35].
  This paper presents a construction for MDS vector codes which simultaneously
ensures both small repair bandwidth and small sub-packetization level. The
obtained codes have the smallest possible sub-packetization level $\ell = O(n -
k)$ for an MDS vector code and the repair bandwidth which is at most twice the
cut-set bound. The paper then generalizes this code construction so that the
repair bandwidth of the obtained codes approach the cut-set bound at the cost
of increased sub-packetization level. The constructions presented in this paper
give MDS vector codes which are linear over the base field $\mathbb{B}$.

 <dc:description>  Given a graph G, the {\em maximum internal spanning tree problem} (MIST for
short) asks for computing a spanning tree T of G such that the number of
internal vertices in T is maximized. MIST has possible applications in the
design of cost-efficient communication networks and water supply networks and
hence has been extensively studied in the literature. MIST is NP-hard and hence
a number of polynomial-time approximation algorithms have been designed for
MIST in the literature. The previously best polynomial-time approximation
algorithm for MIST achieves a ratio of 3/4. In this paper, we first design a
simpler algorithm that achieves the same ratio and the same time complexity as
the previous best. We then refine the algorithm into a new approximation
algorithm that achieves a better ratio (namely, 13/17) with the same time
complexity. Our new algorithm explores much deeper structure of the problem
than the previous best. The discovered structure may be used to design even
better approximation or parameterized algorithms for the problem in the future.

 <dc:title>A Data-driven Approach for Human Pose Tracking Based on Spatio-temporal

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for human pose tracking in
video data. We formulate the human pose tracking problem as a discrete
optimization problem based on spatio-temporal pictorial structure model and
solve this problem in a greedy framework very efficiently. We propose the model
to track the human pose by combining the human pose estimation from single
image and traditional object tracking in a video. Our pose tracking objective
function consists of the following terms: likeliness of appearance of a part
within a frame, temporal displacement of the part from previous frame to the
current frame, and the spatial dependency of a part with its parent in the
graph structure. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets (VideoPose2,
Poses in the Wild and Outdoor Pose) as well as on our newly build ICDPose
dataset shows the usefulness of our proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Fast multidimensional convolution can be performed naively in quadratic time
and can often be performed more efficiently via the Fourier transform; however,
when the dimensionality is large, these algorithms become more challenging. A
method is proposed for performing exact hypercube convolution in sub-quadratic
time. The method outperforms FFTPACK, called via numpy, and FFTW, called via
pyfftw) for hypercube convolution. Embeddings in hypercubes can be paired with
sub-quadratic hypercube convolution method to construct sub-quadratic
algorithms for variants of vector convolution.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel face alignment method that trains deep
convolutional network from coarse to fine. It divides given landmarks into
principal subset and elaborate subset. We firstly keep a large weight for
principal subset to make our network primarily predict their locations while
slightly take elaborate subset into account. Next the weight of principal
subset is gradually decreased until two subsets have equivalent weights. This
process contributes to learn a good initial model and search the optimal model
smoothly to avoid missing fairly good intermediate models in subsequent
procedures. On the challenging COFW dataset [1], our method achieves 6.33% mean
error with a reduction of 21.37% compared with the best previous result [2].

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we characterize the asymmetric total degrees of freedom (DoF)
of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) 3-way channel. Each node has a
separate-antenna full-duplex MIMO transceiver with a different number of
antennas, where each antenna can be configured for either signal transmission
or reception. We study this system under two message configurations; the first
configuration is when each node has two unicast messages to be delivered to the
two other nodes, while the second configuration is when each node has two
unicast messages as well as one broadcast message to be delivered to the two
other nodes. For each configuration, we first derive upper bounds on the total
DoF of the system. Cut-set bounds in conjunction with genie-aided bounds are
derived to characterize the achievable total DoF. Afterwards, we analytically
derive the optimal number of transmit and receive antennas at each node to
maximize the total DoF of the system, subject to the total number of antennas
at each node. Finally, the achievable schemes for each configuration are
constructed. The proposed schemes are mainly based on zero-forcing and
null-space transmit beamforming.

 <dc:title>Optimal Distance Labeling Schemes for Trees</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Labeling schemes seek to assign a short label to each node in a network, so
that a function on two nodes can be computed by examining their labels alone.
For the particular case of trees, optimal bounds (up to low order terms) were
recently obtained for adjacency labeling [FOCS'15], nearest common ancestor
labeling [SODA'14], and ancestry labeling [SICOMP'06]. In this paper we obtain
optimal bounds for distance labeling. We present labels of size
$1/4\log^2n+o(\log^2n)$, matching (up to low order terms) the recent
$1/4\log^2n-O(\log n)$ lower bound [ICALP'16].
  Prior to our work, all distance labeling schemes for trees could be
reinterpreted as universal trees. A tree $T$ is said to be universal if any
tree on $n$ nodes can be found as a subtree of $T$. A universal tree with $|T|$
nodes implies a distance labeling scheme with label size $\log |T|$. In 1981,
Chung et al. proved that any distance labeling scheme based on universal trees
requires labels of size $1/2\log^2 n-\log n\cdot\log\log n+O(\log n)$. Our
scheme is the first to break this lower bound, showing a separation between
distance labeling and universal trees.
  The $\Theta(\log^2 n)$ barrier has led researchers to consider distances
bounded by $k$. The size of such labels was improved from $\log n+O(k\sqrt{\log
n})$ [WADS'01] to $\log n+O(k^2(\log(k\log n))$ [SODA'03] and then to $\log
n+O(k\log(k\log(n/k)))$ [PODC'07]. We show how to construct labels whose size
is $\min\{\log n+O(k\log((\log n)/k)),O(\log n\cdot\log(k/\log n))\}$. We
complement this with almost tight lower bounds of $\log n+\Omega(k\log(\log
n/(k\log k)))$ and $\Omega(\log n\cdot\log(k/\log n))$. Finally, we consider
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate distances. We show that the labeling scheme of
[ICALP'16] can be easily modified to obtain an $O(\log(1/\varepsilon)\cdot\log
n)$ upper bound and we prove a $\Omega(\log(1/\varepsilon)\cdot\log n)$ lower
bound.

 <dc:description>  Consider a fully-connected synchronous distributed system consisting of $n$
nodes, where up to $f$ nodes may be faulty and every node starts in an
arbitrary initial state. In the synchronous $C$-counting problem, all nodes
need to eventually agree on a counter that is increased by one modulo $C$ in
each round for given $C&gt;1$. In the self-stabilising firing squad problem, the
task is to eventually guarantee that all non-faulty nodes have simultaneous
responses to external inputs: if a subset of the correct nodes receive an
external &quot;go&quot; signal as input, then all correct nodes should agree on a round
(in the not-too-distant future) in which to jointly output a &quot;fire&quot; signal.
Moreover, no node should generate a &quot;fire&quot; signal without some correct node
having previously received a &quot;go&quot; signal as input.
  We present a framework reducing both tasks to binary consensus at very small
cost. For example, we obtain a deterministic algorithm for self-stabilising
Byzantine firing squads with optimal resilience $f&lt;n/3$, asymptotically optimal
stabilisation and response time $O(f)$, and message size $O(\log f)$. As our
framework does not restrict the type of consensus routines used, we also obtain
efficient randomised solutions, and it is straightforward to adapt our
framework for other types of permanent faults.

 <dc:description>  Recently, several optimization methods have been successfully applied to the
hyperparameter optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs). The methods work by
modeling the joint distribution of hyperparameter values and corresponding
error. Those methods become less practical when applied to modern DNNs whose
training may take a few days and thus one cannot collect sufficient
observations to accurately model the distribution. To address this challenging
issue, we propose a method that learns to transfer optimal hyperparameter
values for a small source dataset to hyperparameter values with comparable
performance on a dataset of interest. As opposed to existing transfer learning
methods, our proposed method does not use hand-designed features. Instead, it
uses surrogates to model the hyperparameter-error distributions of the two
datasets and trains a neural network to learn the transfer function. Extensive
experiments on three CV benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate the efficiency
of our method.

 <dc:description>  We present and evaluate the capacity of a deep neural network to learn robust
features from EEG to automatically detect seizures. This is a challenging
problem because seizure manifestations on EEG are extremely variable both
inter- and intra-patient. By simultaneously capturing spectral, temporal and
spatial information our recurrent convolutional neural network learns a general
spatially invariant representation of a seizure. The proposed approach exceeds
significantly previous results obtained on cross-patient classifiers both in
terms of sensitivity and false positive rate. Furthermore, our model proves to
be robust to missing channel and variable electrode montage.

 <dc:description>  Detection of moving objects in videos is a crucial step towards successful
surveillance and monitoring applications. A key component for such tasks is
called background subtraction and tries to extract regions of interest from the
image background for further processing or action. For this reason, its
accuracy and real-time performance is of great significance. Although,
effective background subtraction methods have been proposed, only a few of them
take into consideration the special characteristics of thermal imagery. In this
work, we propose a background subtraction scheme, which models the thermal
responses of each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians with unknown number of
components. Following a Bayesian approach, our method automatically estimates
the mixture structure, while simultaneously it avoids over/under fitting. The
pixel density estimate is followed by an efficient and highly accurate updating
mechanism, which permits our system to be automatically adapted to dynamically
changing operation conditions. We propose a reference implementation of our
method in reconfigurable hardware achieving both adequate performance and low
power consumption. Adopting a High Level Synthesis design, demanding floating
point arithmetic operations are mapped in reconfigurable hardware;
demonstrating fast-prototyping and on-field customization at the same time.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Video Streaming over LTE Unlicensed</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the problem of adaptive video streaming over an
LTE-A network that utilizes Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) which is an instance
of LTE Unlicensed. With LTE Unlicensed users of the LTE-A network opportunisti-
cally access radio resources from unlicensed and licensed carriers through
Carrier Aggregation (CA). Our objective is to select the highest possible video
quality for each LTE-A user while also try to deliver video data in time for
playback, and thus avoid buffer under-run events that deteriorate viewing
experience. However, the unpredictable nature of the wireless channel, as well
as the unknown utilization of the unlicensed carrier by other unlicensed users,
result in a challenging optimization problem. We first focus on developing an
accurate system model of the adaptive streaming system, LTE-A, and the
stochastic availability of unlicensed resources. Then, the formulated problem
is solved in two stages: First, we calculate a proportionally fair video
quality for each user, and second we execute resource allocation on a shorter
time scale compatible with LTE-A. We compare our framework with the typical
proportional fair scheduler as well as a state-of-the-art LTE-A adaptive video
streaming framework in terms of average segment quality and number of buffer
under- run events. Results show that the proposed quality selection and
scheduling algorithms, not only achieve higher video segment quality in most
cases, but also minimize the amount and duration of video freezes as a result
of buffer under-run events.

 <dc:description>  We present a non-linear dynamical system for modelling the effect of drug
infusions on the vital signs of patients admitted in Intensive Care Units
(ICUs). More specifically we are interested in modelling the effect of a widely
used anaesthetic drug (Propofol) on a patient's monitored depth of anaesthesia
and haemodynamics. We compare our approach with one from the
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) literature and show that we can
provide significant improvements in performance without requiring the
incorporation of expert physiological knowledge in our system.

 <dc:description>  We propose a minimal solution for the similarity registration (rigid pose and
scale) between two sets of 3D lines, and also between a set of co-planar points
and a set of 3D lines. The first problem is solved up to 8 discrete solutions
with a minimum of 2 line-line correspondences, while the second is solved up to
4 discrete solutions using 4 point-line correspondences. We use these
algorithms to perform the extrinsic calibration between a pose tracking sensor
and a 2D/3D ultrasound (US) curvilinear probe using a tracked needle as
calibration target. The needle is tracked as a 3D line, and is scanned by the
ultrasound as either a 3D line (3D US) or as a 2D point (2D US). Since the
scale factor that converts US scan units to metric coordinates is unknown, the
calibration is formulated as a similarity registration problem. We present
results with both synthetic and real data and show that the minimum solutions
outperform the correspondent non-minimal linear formulations.
