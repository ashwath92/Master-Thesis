 <dc:description>  Many hardness results in computational social choice make use of the fact
that every directed graph may be induced as the pairwise majority relation of
some preference profile. However, this fact requires a number of voters that is
almost linear in the number of alternatives. It is therefore unclear whether
these results remain intact when the number of voters is bounded, as is, for
example, typically the case in search engine aggregation settings. In this
paper, we provide a systematic study of majority digraphs for a constant number
of voters resulting in analytical, experimental, and complexity-theoretic
insights. First, we characterize the set of digraphs that can be induced by two
and three voters, respectively, and give sufficient conditions for larger
numbers of voters. Second, we present a surprisingly efficient implementation
via SAT solving for computing the minimal number of voters that is required to
induce a given digraph and experimentally evaluate how many voters are required
to induce the majority digraphs of real-world and generated preference
profiles. Finally, we leverage our sufficient conditions to show that the
winner determination problem of various well-known voting rules remains hard
even when there is only a small constant number of voters. In particular, we
show that Kemeny's rule is hard to evaluate for 7 voters, while previous
methods could only establish such a result for constant even numbers of voters.

 <dc:title>Deep LDA-Pruned Nets for Efficient Facial Gender Classification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Many real-time tasks, such as human-computer interaction, require fast and
efficient facial gender classification. Although deep CNN nets have been very
effective for a multitude of classification tasks, their high space and time
demands make them impractical for personal computers and mobile devices without
a powerful GPU. In this paper, we develop a 16-layer, yet lightweight, neural
network which boosts efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our net is
pruned from the VGG-16 model starting from the last convolutional (conv) layer
where we find neuron activations are highly uncorrelated given the gender.
Through Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), we show that this high
decorrelation makes it safe to discard directly last conv layer neurons with
high within-class variance and low between-class variance. Combined with either
Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Bayesian classification, the reduced CNNs are
capable of achieving comparable (or even higher) accuracies on the LFW and
CelebA datasets than the original net with fully connected layers. On LFW, only
four Conv5_3 neurons are able to maintain a comparably high recognition
accuracy, which results in a reduction of total network size by a factor of 70X
with a 11 fold speedup. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art pruning method as
well as two smaller nets in terms of accuracy loss and convolutional layers
pruning rate are also provided.

 <dc:description>  We prove that any non-adaptive algorithm that tests whether an unknown
Boolean function $f: \{0, 1\}^n\to \{0, 1\}$ is a $k$-junta or $\epsilon$-far
from every $k$-junta must make $\widetilde{\Omega}(k^{3/2} / \epsilon)$ many
queries for a wide range of parameters $k$ and $\epsilon$. Our result
dramatically improves previous lower bounds from [BGSMdW13, STW15], and is
essentially optimal given Blais's non-adaptive junta tester from [Blais08],
which makes $\widetilde{O}(k^{3/2})/\epsilon$ queries. Combined with the
adaptive tester of [Blais09] which makes $O(k\log k + k /\epsilon)$ queries,
our result shows that adaptivity enables polynomial savings in query complexity
for junta testing.

 <dc:description>  We formalize and analyze a new problem in formal language theory termed
control improvisation. Given a specification language, the problem is to
produce an improviser, a probabilistic algorithm that randomly generates words
in the language, subject to two additional constraints: the satisfaction of a
quantitative soft constraint, and the exhibition of a specified amount of
randomness. Control improvisation has many applications, including for example
systematically generating random test vectors satisfying format constraints or
preconditions while being similar to a library of seed inputs. Other
applications include robotic surveillance, machine improvisation of music, and
randomized variants of the supervisory control problem. We describe a general
framework for solving the control improvisation problem, and use it to give
efficient algorithms for several practical classes of instances with finite
automaton and context-free grammar specifications. We also provide a detailed
complexity analysis, establishing #P-hardness of the problem in many other
cases. For these intractable cases, we show how symbolic techniques based on
Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers can be used to find approximate solutions.
Finally, we discuss an extension of control improvisation to multiple soft
constraints that is useful in some applications.

 <dc:description>  As it is getting increasingly difficult to achieve gains in the density and
power efficiency of microelectronic computing devices because of lithographic
techniques reaching fundamental physical limits, new approaches are required to
maximize the benefits of distributed sensors, micro-robots or smart materials.
Biologically-inspired devices, such as artificial neural networks, can process
information with a high level of parallelism to efficiently solve difficult
problems, even when implemented using conventional microelectronic
technologies. We describe a mechanical device, which operates in a manner
similar to artificial neural networks, to solve efficiently two difficult
benchmark problems (computing the parity of a bit stream, and classifying
spoken words). The device consists in a network of masses coupled by linear
springs and attached to a substrate by non-linear springs, thus forming a
network of anharmonic oscillators. As the masses can directly couple to forces
applied on the device, this approach combines sensing and computing functions
in a single power-efficient device with compact dimensions.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a spatial-based trajectory planning method for automated
vehicles under actuator, obstacle avoidance, and vehicle dimension constraints.
Starting from a nonlinear kinematic bicycle model, vehicle dynamics are
transformed to a road-aligned coordinate frame with path along the road
centerline replacing time as the dependent variable. Space-varying vehicle
dimension constraints are linearized around a reference path to pose convex
optimization problems. Such constraints do not require to inflate obstacles by
safety-margins and therefore maximize performance in very constrained
environments. A sequential linear programming (SLP) algorithm is motivated. A
linear program (LP) is solved at each SLP-iteration. The relation between LP
formulation and maximum admissible traveling speeds within vehicle tire
friction limits is discussed. The proposed method is evaluated in a roomy and
in a tight maneuvering driving scenario, whereby a comparison to a
semi-analytical clothoid-based path planner is given. Effectiveness is
demonstrated particularly for very constrained environments, requiring to
account for constraints and planning over the entire obstacle constellation
space.

 <dc:title>Good Features to Correlate for Visual Tracking</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gundogdu, Erhan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  During the recent years, correlation filters have shown dominant and
spectacular results for visual object tracking. The types of the features that
are employed in these family of trackers significantly affect the performance
of visual tracking. The ultimate goal is to utilize robust features invariant
to any kind of appearance change of the object, while predicting the object
location as properly as in the case of no appearance change. As the deep
learning based methods has emerged, the study of learning features for specific
tasks has accelerated. For instance, discriminative visual tracking methods
based on deep architectures have been studied with promising performance.
Nevertheless, correlation filter based (CFB) trackers confine themselves to use
the pre-trained networks which are trained for object classification problem.
To this end, in this manuscript the problem of learning deep fully
convolutional features for the CFB visual tracking is formulated. In order to
learn the proposed model, a novel and efficient backpropagation algorithm is
presented based on the loss function of the network. The proposed learning
framework enables the network model to be flexible for a custom design.
Moreover, it alleviates the dependency on the network trained for
classification. Extensive performance analysis shows the efficacy of the
proposed custom design in the CFB tracking framework. By fine-tuning the
convolutional parts of a state-of-the-art network and integrating this model to
a CFB tracker, which is the winner of VOT2016, 18% increase is achieved in
terms of expected average overlap, and tracking failures are decreased by 25%,
while maintaining the superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in OTB-2013
and OTB-2015 tracking datasets.

 <dc:description>  Image clustering is one of the most important computer vision applications,
which has been extensively studied in literature. However, current clustering
methods mostly suffer from lack of efficiency and scalability when dealing with
large-scale and high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a new
clustering model, called DEeP Embedded RegularIzed ClusTering (DEPICT), which
efficiently maps data into a discriminative embedding subspace and precisely
predicts cluster assignments. DEPICT generally consists of a multinomial
logistic regression function stacked on top of a multi-layer convolutional
autoencoder. We define a clustering objective function using relative entropy
(KL divergence) minimization, regularized by a prior for the frequency of
cluster assignments. An alternating strategy is then derived to optimize the
objective by updating parameters and estimating cluster assignments.
Furthermore, we employ the reconstruction loss functions in our autoencoder, as
a data-dependent regularization term, to prevent the deep embedding function
from overfitting. In order to benefit from end-to-end optimization and
eliminate the necessity for layer-wise pretraining, we introduce a joint
learning framework to minimize the unified clustering and reconstruction loss
functions together and train all network layers simultaneously. Experimental
results indicate the superiority and faster running time of DEPICT in
real-world clustering tasks, where no labeled data is available for
hyper-parameter tuning.

 <dc:description>  Rate-Splitting (RS) has recently been shown to provide significant
performance benefits in various multi-user transmission scenarios. In parallel,
the huge degrees-of-freedom provided by the appealing massive Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO) necessitate the employment of inexpensive hardware,
being more prone to hardware imperfections, in order to be a cost-efficient
technology. Hence, in this work, we focus on a realistic massive Multiple-Input
Single-Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC) hampered by the inevitable hardware
impairments. We consider a general experimentally validated model of hardware
impairments, accounting for the presence of \textit{multiplicative distortion}
due to phase noise, \textit{additive distortion noise} and \textit{thermal
noise amplification}. Under both scenarios with perfect and imperfect channel
state information at the transmitter (CSIT), we analyze the potential
robustness of RS to each separate hardware imperfection. We analytically assess
the sum-rate degradation due to hardware imperfections. Interestingly, in the
case of imperfect CSIT, we demonstrate that RS is a robust strategy for
multiuser MIMO in the presence of phase and amplified thermal noise, since its
sum-rate does not saturate at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrary to
conventional techniques. On the other hand, the additive impairments always
lead to a sum-rate saturation at high SNR, even after the application of RS.
However, RS still enhances the performance. Furthermore, as the number of users
increases, the gains provided by RS decrease not only in ideal conditions, but
in practical conditions with RTHIs as well.

 <dc:description>  We consider scenarios in which we wish to perform joint scene understanding,
object tracking, activity recognition, and other tasks in environments in which
multiple people are wearing body-worn cameras while a third-person static
camera also captures the scene. To do this, we need to establish person-level
correspondences across first- and third-person videos, which is challenging
because the camera wearer is not visible from his/her own egocentric video,
preventing the use of direct feature matching. In this paper, we propose a new
semi-Siamese Convolutional Neural Network architecture to address this novel
challenge. We formulate the problem as learning a joint embedding space for
first- and third-person videos that considers both spatial- and motion-domain
cues. A new triplet loss function is designed to minimize the distance between
correct first- and third-person matches while maximizing the distance between
incorrect ones. This end-to-end approach performs significantly better than
several baselines, in part by learning the first- and third-person features
optimized for matching jointly with the distance measure itself.

 <dc:title>ADN: An Information-Centric Networking Architecture for the Internet of

 <dc:creator>Garcia-Luna-Aceves, J. J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Forwarding data by name has been assumed to be a necessary aspect of an
information-centric redesign of the current Internet architecture that makes
content access, dissemination, and storage more efficient. The Named Data
Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) architectures are the
leading examples of such an approach. However, forwarding data by name incurs
storage and communication complexities that are orders of magnitude larger than
solutions based on forwarding data using addresses. Furthermore, the specific
algorithms used in NDN and CCNx have been shown to have a number of
limitations. The Addressable Data Networking (ADN) architecture is introduced
as an alternative to NDN and CCNx. ADN is particularly attractive for
large-scale deployments of the Internet of Things (IoT), because it requires
far less storage and processing in relaying nodes than NDN. ADN allows things
and data to be denoted by names, just like NDN and CCNx do. However, instead of
replacing the waist of the Internet with named-data forwarding, ADN uses an
address-based forwarding plane and introduces an information plane that
seamlessly maps names to addresses without the involvement of end-user
applications. Simulation results illustrate the order of magnitude savings in
complexity that can be attained with ADN compared to NDN.

 <dc:description>  An engineering design process may involve software modules that can executed
concurrently. Concurrent modules can be very easily subject to some
synchronization errors. This paper discusses verification process for such
engineering software. We present a method for verification that requires
several steps. First, the state diagram models are constructed that describe
the design iterations and interactions with the designer. Next, the state
diagram models are transformed into concurrent state machines (CSM). After
that, the CSM models are analyzed in order to verify their correctness. In this
phase, the modifications are performed in necessary. In the last phase the code
is generated. The tools to support our method can be called new concurrent CASE
tools. Using these tools the engineering software can be created that is
verified for correctness in respect to concurrent execution.

 <dc:description>  In spoken languages, speakers divide up the space of phonetic possibilities
into different regions, corresponding to different phonemes. We consider a
simple exemplar model of how this division of phonetic space varies over time
among a population of language users. In the particular model we consider, we
show that, once the system is initialized with a given set of phonemes, that
phonemes do not become extinct: all phonemes will be maintained in the system
for all time. This is in contrast to what is observed in more complex models.
Furthermore, we show that the boundaries between phonemes fluctuate and we
quantitatively study the fluctuations in a simple instance of our model. These
results prepare the ground for more sophisticated models in which some phonemes
go extinct or new phonemes emerge through other processes.

 <dc:description>  We present SwellShark, a framework for building biomedical named entity
recognition (NER) systems quickly and without hand-labeled data. Our approach
views biomedical resources like lexicons as function primitives for
autogenerating weak supervision. We then use a generative model to unify and
denoise this supervision and construct large-scale, probabilistically labeled
datasets for training high-accuracy NER taggers. In three biomedical NER tasks,
SwellShark achieves competitive scores with state-of-the-art supervised
benchmarks using no hand-labeled training data. In a drug name extraction task
using patient medical records, one domain expert using SwellShark achieved
within 5.1% of a crowdsourced annotation approach -- which originally utilized
20 teams over the course of several weeks -- in 24 hours.

 <dc:description>  We study the shared processor scheduling problem with a single shared
processor where a unit time saving (weight) obtained by processing a job on the
shared processor depends on the job. A polynomial-time optimization algorithm
has been given for the problem with equal weights in the literature. This paper
extends that result by showing an $O(n \log n)$ optimization algorithm for a
class of instances in which non-decreasing order of jobs with respect to
processing times provides a non-increasing order with respect to weights ---
this instance generalizes the unweighted case of the problem. This algorithm
also leads to a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm for the general weighted
problem. The complexity of the weighted problem remains open.

 <dc:description>  Training convolutional networks (CNN's) that fit on a single GPU with
minibatch stochastic gradient descent has become effective in practice.
However, there is still no effective method for training large CNN's that do
not fit in the memory of a few GPU cards, or for parallelizing CNN training. In
this work we show that a simple hard mixture of experts model can be
efficiently trained to good effect on large scale hashtag (multilabel)
prediction tasks. Mixture of experts models are not new (Jacobs et. al. 1991,
Collobert et. al. 2003), but in the past, researchers have had to devise
sophisticated methods to deal with data fragmentation. We show empirically that
modern weakly supervised data sets are large enough to support naive
partitioning schemes where each data point is assigned to a single expert.
Because the experts are independent, training them in parallel is easy, and
evaluation is cheap for the size of the model. Furthermore, we show that we can
use a single decoding layer for all the experts, allowing a unified feature
embedding space. We demonstrate that it is feasible (and in fact relatively
painless) to train far larger models than could be practically trained with
standard CNN architectures, and that the extra capacity can be well used on
current datasets.

 <dc:description>  Thanks to the recent developments of Convolutional Neural Networks, the
performance of face verification methods has increased rapidly. In a typical
face verification method, feature normalization is a critical step for boosting
performance. This motivates us to introduce and study the effect of
normalization during training. But we find this is non-trivial, despite
normalization being differentiable. We identify and study four issues related
to normalization through mathematical analysis, which yields understanding and
helps with parameter settings. Based on this analysis we propose two strategies
for training using normalized features. The first is a modification of softmax
loss, which optimizes cosine similarity instead of inner-product. The second is
a reformulation of metric learning by introducing an agent vector for each
class. We show that both strategies, and small variants, consistently improve
performance by between 0.2% to 0.4% on the LFW dataset based on two models.
This is significant because the performance of the two models on LFW dataset is
close to saturation at over 98%. Codes and models are released on

 <dc:title>Robust Multi-view Pedestrian Tracking Using Neural Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a real-time robust multi-view pedestrian detection
and tracking system for video surveillance using neural networks which can be
used in dynamic environments. The proposed system consists of two phases:
multi-view pedestrian detection and tracking. First, pedestrian detection
utilizes background subtraction to segment the foreground blob. An adaptive
background subtraction method where each of the pixel of input image models as
a mixture of Gaussians and uses an on-line approximation to update the model
applies to extract the foreground region. The Gaussian distributions are then
evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a background
process. This method produces a steady, real-time tracker in outdoor
environment that consistently deals with changes of lighting condition, and
long-term scene change. Second, the Tracking is performed at two phases:
pedestrian classification and tracking the individual subject. A sliding window
is applied on foreground binary image to select an input window which is used
for selecting the input image patches from actually input frame. The neural
networks is used for classification with PHOG features. Finally, a Kalman
filter is applied to calculate the subsequent step for tracking that aims at
finding the exact position of pedestrians in an input image. The experimental
result shows that the proposed approach yields promising performance on
multi-view pedestrian detection and tracking on different benchmark datasets.

 <dc:description>  In 2011 the DNA seesaw gate motif was introduced. It is a powerful
feed-forward DNA nanodevice that can perform digital logic computations. The
landmark of that work managed to evaluate moderately large Boolean circuits by
cascading multiple DNA seesaw gates. Although the design is robust in solution
and scalable, it is designed for one time use and is not reusable. This
prevents pursuing important applications such as feedback and sequential
digital circuits. We present a novel design for DNA nanodevices that can
perform digital logic computations and are furthermore renewable. First, we
modified the prior DNA seesaw gate motif into a hairpin. We call the resulting
motif a DNA hairpin-seesaw gate. We show the feed-forward digital computation
reaction imitates the seesaw gate motif. Second, we added a reporting phase
that provides increased scalability to our device. Third, we designed input and
fuel extracting hairpins that when added, initiate a renewing process. This
results in a renewed functional gate, in its original configuration, which is
able to make a new logical computation with new inputs. Finally, we introduced
a renewable two-input Boolean logic OR gate. After calculating the output of a
certain input set, the circuit is restored and a new set of inputs is
introduced to compute the new output. We provide experimental fluorescent data
on three repeated rounds of executions of our hairpin gate motif and its
restoration, indicating gradual loss of response. Finally, we calculated rate
constants of our experimental data by fitting it to a second order reaction
model using maximum likelihood estimation method.

$\mathbb{F}_{p^{2m}}+u\mathbb{F}_{p^{2m}}$. The good parameters of quantum

 <dc:description>  One of the challenges in evaluating multi-object video detection, tracking
and classification systems is having publically available data sets with which
to compare different systems. However, the measures of performance for tracking
and classification are different. Data sets that are suitable for evaluating
tracking systems may not be appropriate for classification. Tracking video data
sets typically only have ground truth track IDs, while classification video
data sets only have ground truth class-label IDs. The former identifies the
same object over multiple frames, while the latter identifies the type of
object in individual frames. This paper describes an advancement of the ground
truth meta-data for the DARPA Neovision2 Tower data set to allow both the
evaluation of tracking and classification. The ground truth data sets presented
in this paper contain unique object IDs across 5 different classes of object
(Car, Bus, Truck, Person, Cyclist) for 24 videos of 871 image frames each. In
addition to the object IDs and class labels, the ground truth data also
contains the original bounding box coordinates together with new bounding boxes
in instances where un-annotated objects were present. The unique IDs are
maintained during occlusions between multiple objects or when objects re-enter
the field of view. This will provide: a solid foundation for evaluating the
performance of multi-object tracking of different types of objects, a
straightforward comparison of tracking system performance using the standard
Multi Object Tracking (MOT) framework, and classification performance using the
Neovision2 metrics. These data have been hosted publically.

 <dc:description>  Increased adaptability of RNN language models leads to improved predictions
that benefit many applications. However, current methods do not take full
advantage of the RNN structure. We show that the most widely-used approach to
adaptation (concatenating the context with the word embedding at the input to
the recurrent layer) is outperformed by a model that has some low-cost
improvements: adaptation of both the hidden and output layers. and a feature
hashing bias term to capture context idiosyncrasies. Experiments on language
modeling and classification tasks using three different corpora demonstrate the
advantages of the proposed techniques.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in 3D fully convolutional networks (FCN) have made it
feasible to produce dense voxel-wise predictions of full volumetric images. In
this work, we show that a multi-class 3D FCN trained on manually labeled CT
scans of seven abdominal structures (artery, vein, liver, spleen, stomach,
gallbladder, and pancreas) can achieve competitive segmentation results, while
avoiding the need for handcrafting features or training organ-specific models.
To this end, we propose a two-stage, coarse-to-fine approach that trains an FCN
model to roughly delineate the organs of interest in the first stage (seeing
$\sim$40% of the voxels within a simple, automatically generated binary mask of
the patient's body). We then use these predictions of the first-stage FCN to
define a candidate region that will be used to train a second FCN. This step
reduces the number of voxels the FCN has to classify to $\sim$10% while
maintaining a recall high of $&gt;$99%. This second-stage FCN can now focus on
more detailed segmentation of the organs. We respectively utilize training and
validation sets consisting of 281 and 50 clinical CT images. Our hierarchical
approach provides an improved Dice score of 7.5 percentage points per organ on
average in our validation set. We furthermore test our models on a completely
unseen data collection acquired at a different hospital that includes 150 CT
scans with three anatomical labels (liver, spleen, and pancreas). In such
challenging organs as the pancreas, our hierarchical approach improves the mean
Dice score from 68.5 to 82.2%, achieving the highest reported average score on

 <dc:description>  Symmetry is an important composition feature by investigating similar sides
inside an image plane. It has a crucial effect to recognize man-made or nature
objects within the universe. Recent symmetry detection approaches used a
smoothing kernel over different voting maps in the polar coordinate system to
detect symmetry peaks, which split the regions of symmetry axis candidates in
inefficient way. We propose a reliable voting representation based on weighted
linear-directional kernel density estimation, to detect multiple symmetries
over challenging real-world and synthetic images. Experimental evaluation on
two public datasets demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed
algorithm to detect global symmetry axes respect to the major image shapes.

 <dc:description>  Neural machine translation (NMT) becomes a new approach to machine
translation and generates much more fluent results compared to statistical
machine translation (SMT).
  However, SMT is usually better than NMT in translation adequacy. It is
therefore a promising direction to combine the advantages of both NMT and SMT.
  In this paper, we propose a neural system combination framework leveraging
multi-source NMT, which takes as input the outputs of NMT and SMT systems and
produces the final translation.
  Extensive experiments on the Chinese-to-English translation task show that
our model archives significant improvement by 5.3 BLEU points over the best
single system output and 3.4 BLEU points over the state-of-the-art traditional
system combination methods.

 <dc:title>Improving Gaze-based Selection using Variable Dwell Time</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Zhaokang</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shi, Bertram E.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In order to avoid the &quot;Midas Touch&quot; problem, gaze-based interfaces for
selection often introduce a dwell time: a fixed amount of time the user must
fixate upon an object before it is selected. Past interfaces have used a
uniform dwell time across all objects. Here, we propose an algorithm for
adjusting the dwell times of different objects based on the inferred
probability that the user wishes to select them. In particular, we introduce a
probabilistic model of gaze behavior and train it on natural gaze trajectories
collected while users surf the web through a gaze-based web browser. Using this
model, we can infer the probability that each hyperlink on the web page is the
one the user intends to select. We assign shorter dwell times to more likely
hyperlinks and longer dwell times to less likely hyperlinks. The resulting
variable dwell time gaze-based browser enables subjects to surf the web faster
and/or more reliably. We use a two-stage hidden Markov model based algorithm to
model the natural eye gaze trajectories. We have evaluated this method
objectively both in simulation and experimentally, and subjectively through
questionnaires. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a
better tradeoff between accuracy and speed. This work demonstrates that natural
eye movements can be used to infer user intent, and that this information can
be used to improve gaze-based selection without increased cognitive load on
users.

 <dc:description>  We present an overview of recently developed data-driven tools for safety
analysis of autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assist systems. The core
algorithms combine model-based, hybrid system reachability analysis with
sensitivity analysis of components with unknown or inaccessible models. We
illustrate the applicability of this approach with a new case study of
emergency braking systems in scenarios with two or three vehicles. This problem
is representative of the most common type of rear-end crashes, which is
relevant for safety analysis of automatic emergency braking (AEB) and forward
collision avoidance systems. We show that our verification tool can effectively
prove the safety of certain scenarios (specified by several parameters like
braking profiles, initial velocities, uncertainties in position and reaction
times), and also compute the severity of accidents for unsafe scenarios.
Through hundreds of verification experiments, we quantified the safety envelope
of the system across relevant parameters. These results show that the approach
is promising for design, debugging and certification. We also show how the
reachability analysis can be combined with statistical information about the
parameters, to assess the risk level of the control system, which in turn is
essential, for example, for determining Automotive Safety Integrity Levels
(ASIL) for the ISO26262 standard.

 <dc:description>  Most of the traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) implements
bottom-up approach (feed-forward) for image classifications. However, many
scientific studies demonstrate that visual perception in primates rely on both
bottom-up and top-down connections. Therefore, in this work, we propose a CNN
network with feedback structure for Solar power plant detection on
middle-resolution satellite images. To express the strength of the top-down
connections, we introduce feedback CNN network (FB-Net) to a baseline CNN model
used for solar power plant classification on multi-spectral satellite data.
Moreover, we introduce a method to improve class activation mapping (CAM) to
our FB-Net, which takes advantage of multi-channel pulse coupled neural network
(m-PCNN) for weakly-supervised localization of the solar power plants from the
features of proposed FB-Net. For the proposed FB-Net CAM with m-PCNN,
experimental results demonstrated promising results on both solar-power plant
image classification and detection task.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of online tracking and classification of
multiple objects in an image sequence. Our proposed solution is to first track
all objects in the scene without relying on object-specific prior knowledge,
which in other systems can take the form of hand-crafted features or user-based
track initialization. We then classify the tracked objects with a fast-learning
image classifier that is based on a shallow convolutional neural network
architecture and demonstrate that object recognition improves when this is
combined with object state information from the tracking algorithm. We argue
that by transferring the use of prior knowledge from the detection and tracking
stages to the classification stage we can design a robust, general purpose
object recognition system with the ability to detect and track a variety of
object types. We describe our biologically inspired implementation, which
adaptively learns the shape and motion of tracked objects, and apply it to the
Neovision2 Tower benchmark data set, which contains multiple object types. An
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach is competitive with
state-of-the-art video object recognition systems that do make use of
object-specific prior knowledge in detection and tracking, while providing
additional practical advantages by virtue of its generality.

 <dc:description>  This work introduces, for the first time, non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) into short-packet communications to achieve low latency in wireless
networks. Specifically, we address the optimization of transmission rates and
power allocation to maximize the effective throughput of the user with a higher
channel gain while guaranteeing the other user achieving a certain level of
effective throughput. To demonstrate the benefits of NOMA, we analyze the
performance of orthogonal multiple access (OMA) as a benchmark. Our examination
shows that NOMA can significantly outperform OMA by achieving a higher
effective throughput with the same latency or incurring a lower latency to
achieve the same effective throughput targets. Surprisingly, we find that the
performance gap between NOMA and OMA becomes more prominent when the effective
throughput targets at the two users become closer to each other. This
demonstrates that NOMA can significantly reduce the latency in the context of
short-packet communications with practical constraints.

entropy, have been applied in many research domains today. In this paper, a
novel generalized relative entropy is constructed to avoid some defects of

more interest due to their power efficiency. We present a new precoding
technique to mitigate the multi-user interference and the quantization
distortions in a downlink multi-user (MU) multiple-input-single-output (MISO)
system with 1-bit quantization at the transmitter. This work is restricted to
PSK modulation schemes. The transmit signal vector is optimized for every
desired received vector taking into account the 1-bit quantization. The
optimization is based on maximizing the safety margin to the decision
thresholds of the PSK modulation. Simulation results show a significant gain in
terms of the uncoded bit-error-ratio (BER) compared to the existing linear
precoding techniques.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Two of the leading approaches for model-free reinforcement learning are
policy gradient methods and $Q$-learning methods. $Q$-learning methods can be
effective and sample-efficient when they work, however, it is not
well-understood why they work, since empirically, the $Q$-values they estimate
are very inaccurate. A partial explanation may be that $Q$-learning methods are
secretly implementing policy gradient updates: we show that there is a precise
equivalence between $Q$-learning and policy gradient methods in the setting of
entropy-regularized reinforcement learning, that &quot;soft&quot; (entropy-regularized)
$Q$-learning is exactly equivalent to a policy gradient method. We also point
out a connection between $Q$-learning methods and natural policy gradient
methods. Experimentally, we explore the entropy-regularized versions of
$Q$-learning and policy gradients, and we find them to perform as well as (or
slightly better than) the standard variants on the Atari benchmark. We also
show that the equivalence holds in practical settings by constructing a
$Q$-learning method that closely matches the learning dynamics of A3C without
using a target network or $\epsilon$-greedy exploration schedule.

 <dc:description>  The panoramic video is widely used to build virtual reality (VR) and is
expected to be one of the next generation Killer-Apps. Transmitting panoramic
VR videos is a challenging task because of two problems: 1) panoramic VR videos
are typically much larger than normal videos but they need to be transmitted
with limited bandwidth in mobile networks. 2) high-resolution and fluent views
should be provided to guarantee a superior user experience and avoid
side-effects such as dizziness and nausea. To address these two problems, we
propose a novel interactive streaming technology, namely Focus-based
Interactive Streaming Framework (FISF). FISF consists of three parts: 1) we use
the classic clustering algorithm DBSCAN to analyze real user data for Video
Focus Detection (VFD); 2) we propose a Focus-based Interactive Streaming
Technology (FIST), including a static version and a dynamic version; 3) we
propose two optimization methods: focus merging and prefetch strategy.
Experimental results show that FISF significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art. The paper is submitted to Sigcomm 2017, VR/AR Network on 31

 <dc:description>  The use of color in QR codes brings extra data capacity, but also inflicts
tremendous challenges on the decoding process due to chromatic distortion,
cross-channel color interference and illumination variation. Particularly, we
further discover a new type of chromatic distortion in high-density color QR
codes, cross-module color interference, caused by the high density which also
makes the geometric distortion correction more challenging. To address these
problems, we propose two approaches, namely, LSVM-CMI and QDA-CMI, which
jointly model these different types of chromatic distortion. Extended from SVM
and QDA, respectively, both LSVM-CMI and QDA-CMI optimize over a particular
objective function to learn a color classifier. Furthermore, a robust geometric
transformation method is proposed to accurately correct the geometric
distortion for high-density color QR codes. We put forth and implement a
framework for high-capacity color QR codes equipped with our methods, called
HiQ. To evaluate the performance of HiQ, we collect a challenging large-scale
color QR code dataset, CUHK-CQRC, which consists of 5390 high-density color QR
code samples. The comparison with the baseline method [2] on CUHK-CQRC shows
that HiQ at least outperforms [2] by 188% in decoding success rate and 60% in
bit error rate. Our implementation of HiQ in iOS and Android also demonstrates
the effectiveness of our framework in real-world applications.

 <dc:description>  Social relations are the foundation of human daily life. Developing
techniques to analyze such relations from visual data bears great potential to
build machines that better understand us and are capable of interacting with us
at a social level. Previous investigations have remained partial due to the
overwhelming diversity and complexity of the topic and consequently have only
focused on a handful of social relations. In this paper, we argue that the
domain-based theory from social psychology is a great starting point to
systematically approach this problem. The theory provides coverage of all
aspects of social relations and equally is concrete and predictive about the
visual attributes and behaviors defining the relations included in each domain.
We provide the first dataset built on this holistic conceptualization of social
life that is composed of a hierarchical label space of social domains and
social relations. We also contribute the first models to recognize such domains
and relations and find superior performance for attribute based features.
Beyond the encouraging performance of the attribute based approach, we also
find interpretable features that are in accordance with the predictions from
social psychology literature. Beyond our findings, we believe that our
contributions more tightly interleave visual recognition and social psychology
theory that has the potential to complement the theoretical work in the area
with empirical and data-driven models of social life.

 <dc:title>A Theory of Nonlinear Signal-Noise Interactions in Wavelength Division
  Multiplexed Coherent Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ghazisaeidi, Amirhossein</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A general theory of nonlinear signal-noise interactions for wavelength
division multiplexed fiber-optic coherent transmission systems is presented.
This theory is based on the regular perturbation treatment of the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation, which governs the wave propagation in the optical fiber,
and is exact up to the first order in the fiber nonlinear coefficient. It takes
into account all cross-channel nonlinear four-wave mixing contributions to the
total variance of nonlinear distortions, dependency on modulation format,
erbium-doped fiber and and backward Raman amplification schemes, heterogeneous
spans, and chromatic dispersion to all orders; moreover, it is computationally
efficient, being 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the available alternative
treatments in the literature. This theory is used to estimate the impact of
signal-noise interaction on uncompensated, as well as on
nonlinearity-compensated systems with ideal multi-channel
digital-backpropagation.

 <dc:description>  We address personalization issues of image captioning, which have not been
discussed yet in previous research. For a query image, we aim to generate a
descriptive sentence, accounting for prior knowledge such as the user's active
vocabularies in previous documents. As applications of personalized image
captioning, we tackle two post automation tasks: hashtag prediction and post
generation, on our newly collected Instagram dataset, consisting of 1.1M posts
from 6.3K users. We propose a novel captioning model named Context Sequence
Memory Network (CSMN). Its unique updates over previous memory network models
include (i) exploiting memory as a repository for multiple types of context
information, (ii) appending previously generated words into memory to capture
long-term information without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem,
and (iii) adopting CNN memory structure to jointly represent nearby ordered
memory slots for better context understanding. With quantitative evaluation and
user studies via Amazon Mechanical Turk, we show the effectiveness of the three
novel features of CSMN and its performance enhancement for personalized image
captioning over state-of-the-art captioning models.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of approximating the partition function of the
ferromagnetic Ising model in graphs and hypergraphs. Our first result is a
deterministic approximation scheme (an FPTAS) for the partition function in
bounded degree graphs that is valid over the entire range of parameters $\beta$
(the interaction) and $\lambda$ (the external field), except for the case
$\vert{\lambda}\vert=1$ (the &quot;zero-field&quot; case). A randomized algorithm (FPRAS)
for all graphs, and all $\beta,\lambda$, has long been known. Unlike most other
deterministic approximation algorithms for problems in statistical physics and
counting, our algorithm does not rely on the &quot;decay of correlations&quot; property.
Rather, we exploit and extend machinery developed recently by Barvinok, and
Patel and Regts, based on the location of the complex zeros of the partition
function, which can be seen as an algorithmic realization of the classical
Lee-Yang approach to phase transitions. Our approach extends to the more
general setting of the Ising model on hypergraphs of bounded degree and edge
size, where no previous algorithms (even randomized) were known for a wide
range of parameters. In order to achieve this extension, we establish a tight
version of the Lee-Yang theorem for the Ising model on hypergraphs, improving a
classical result of Suzuki and Fisher.

 <dc:description>  Bandit structured prediction describes a stochastic optimization framework
where learning is performed from partial feedback. This feedback is received in
the form of a task loss evaluation to a predicted output structure, without
having access to gold standard structures. We advance this framework by lifting
linear bandit learning to neural sequence-to-sequence learning problems using
attention-based recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, we show how to
incorporate control variates into our learning algorithms for variance
reduction and improved generalization. We present an evaluation on a neural
machine translation task that shows improvements of up to 5.89 BLEU points for
domain adaptation from simulated bandit feedback.

 <dc:description>  Graph models are relevant in many fields, such as distributed computing,
intelligent tutoring systems or social network analysis. In many cases, such
models need to take changes in the graph structure into account, i.e. a varying
number of nodes or edges. Predicting such changes within graphs can be expected
to yield important insight with respect to the underlying dynamics, e.g. with
respect to user behaviour. However, predictive techniques in the past have
almost exclusively focused on single edges or nodes. In this contribution, we
attempt to predict the future state of a graph as a whole. We propose to phrase
time series prediction as a regression problem and apply dissimilarity- or
kernel-based regression techniques, such as 1-nearest neighbor, kernel
regression and Gaussian process regression, which can be applied to graphs via
graph kernels. The output of the regression is a point embedded in a
pseudo-Euclidean space, which can be analyzed using subsequent dissimilarity-
or kernel-based processing methods. We discuss strategies to speed up Gaussian
Processes regression from cubic to linear time and evaluate our approach on two
well-established theoretical models of graph evolution as well as two real data
sets from the domain of intelligent tutoring systems. We find that simple
regression methods, such as kernel regression, are sufficient to capture the
dynamics in the theoretical models, but that Gaussian process regression
significantly improves the prediction error for real-world data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a learning-based low-overhead channel estimation
method for coordinated beamforming in ultra-dense networks. We first show
through simulation that the channel state information (CSI) of geographically
separated base stations (BSs) exhibits strong non-linear correlations in terms
of mutual information. This finding enables us to adopt a novel learning-based
approach to remotely infer the quality of different beamforming patterns at a
dense-layer BS based on the CSI of an umbrella control-layer BS. The proposed
scheme can reduce channel acquisition overhead by replacing pilot-aided channel
estimation with the online inference from an artificial neural network, which
is fitted offline. Moreover, we propose to exploit joint learning of multiple
CBSs and involve more candidate beam patterns to obtain better performance.
Simulation results based on stochastic ray-tracing channel models show that the
proposed scheme can reach an accuracy of 99.74% in settings with 20 beamforming
patterns.

 <dc:description>  The nonnegative and positive semidefinite (PSD-) ranks are closely connected
to the nonnegative and positive semidefinite extension complexities of a
polytope, which are the minimal dimensions of linear and SDP programs which
represent this polytope. Though some exponential lower bounds on the
nonnegative and PSD- ranks has recently been proved for the slack matrices of
some particular polytopes, there are still no tight bounds for these
quantities. We explore some existing bounds on the PSD-rank and prove that they
cannot give exponential lower bounds on the extension complexity. Our approach
consists in proving that the existing bounds are upper bounded by the
polynomials of the regular rank of the matrix, which is equal to the dimension
of the polytope (up to an additive constant). As one of the implications, we
also retrieve an upper bound on the mutual information of an arbitrary matrix
of a joint distribution, based on its regular rank.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a class of nonlinear least square error precoders with a general
penalty function for multiuser massive MIMO systems. The generality of the
penalty function allows us to consider several hardware limitations including
transmitters with a predefined constellation and restricted number of active
antennas. The large-system performance is then investigated via the replica
method under the assumption of replica symmetry. It is shown that the least
square precoders exhibit the &quot;marginal decoupling property&quot; meaning that the
marginal distributions of all precoded symbols converge to a deterministic
distribution. As a result, the asymptotic performance of the precoders is
described by an equivalent single-user system. To address some applications of
the results, we further study the asymptotic performance of the precoders when
both the peak-to-average power ratio and number of active transmit antennas are
constrained. Our numerical investigations show that for a desired distortion at
the receiver side, proposed forms of the least square precoders need to employ
around %35\%$ fewer number of active antennas compared to cases with random
transmit antenna selection.

lives? We consider this in the context of resource-allocation problems, we show
that algorithms can guarantee certain types of fairness in a verifiable way.
Our conceptual contribution is a simple approach to fairness in this context,
which only requires that all users trust some public lottery. Our technical
contributions are in ways to address the $k$-center and knapsack-center
problems that arise in this context: we develop a novel dependent-rounding
technique that, via the new ingredients of &quot;slowing down&quot; and additional
randomization, guarantees stronger correlation properties than known before.

 <dc:description>  Boolean networks is a well-established formalism for modelling biological
systems. A vital challenge for analysing a Boolean network is to identify all
the attractors. This becomes more challenging for large asynchronous Boolean
networks, due to the asynchronous updating scheme. Existing methods are
prohibited due to the well-known state-space explosion problem in large Boolean
networks. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing a SCC-based
decomposition method. We prove the correctness of our proposed method and
demonstrate its efficiency with two real-life biological networks.

 <dc:description>  A spatially reconfigurable antenna arrays consists of an antenna array of
finite length and fixed geometry which is displaced within a given area. Using
these reconfigurable components, the performance of MIMO systems is remarkably
improved by effectively positioning the array in its displacement area. This
paper studies the large-system performance of MIMO setups with spatially
reconfigurable antenna arrays when the displacement area is large. Considering
fading channels, the distribution of the input-output mutual information is
derived, and the asymptotic hardening property is demonstrated to hold. As the
size of the displacement area grows large, the mutual information is shown to
converge in distribution to a type-one Gumbel random variable whose mean grows
large proportional to the displacement size, and whose variance tends to zero.
Our numerical investigations depict that the type-one Gumbel approximation
closely tracks the empirical distribution even for a finite displacement size.

 <dc:description>  Precise delineation of organs at risk (OAR) is a crucial task in radiotherapy
treatment planning, which aims at delivering high dose to the tumour while
sparing healthy tissues. In recent years algorithms showed high performance and
the possibility to automate this task for many OAR. However, for some OAR
precise delineation remains challenging. The esophagus with a versatile shape
and poor contrast is among these structures. To tackle these issues we propose
a 3D fully (convolutional neural network (CNN) driven random walk (RW) approach
to automatically segment the esophagus on CT. First, a soft probability map is
generated by the CNN. Then an active contour model (ACM) is fitted on the
probability map to get a first estimation of the center line. The outputs of
the CNN and ACM are then used in addition to CT Hounsfield values to drive the
RW. Evaluation and training was done on 50 CTs with peer reviewed esophagus
contours. Results were assessed regarding spatial overlap and shape
similarities.
  The generated contours showed a mean Dice coefficient of 0.76, an average
symmetric square distance of 1.36 mm and an average Hausdorff distance of 11.68
compared to the reference. These figures translate into a very good agreement
with the reference contours and an increase in accuracy compared to other
methods.
  We show that by employing a CNN accurate estimations of esophagus location
can be obtained and refined by a post processing RW step. One of the main
advantages compared to previous methods is that our network performs
convolutions in a 3D manner, fully exploiting the 3D spatial context and
performing an efficient and precise volume-wise prediction. The whole
segmentation process is fully automatic and yields esophagus delineations in
very good agreement with the used gold standard, showing that it can compete
with previously published methods.

 <dc:description>  Gene regulation is a series of processes that control gene expression and its
extent. The connections among genes and their regulatory molecules, usually
transcription factors, and a descriptive model of such connections, are known
as gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Elucidating GRNs is crucial to understand
the inner workings of the cell and the complexity of gene interactions. To
date, numerous algorithms have been developed to infer gene regulatory
networks. However, as the number of identified genes increases and the
complexity of their interactions is uncovered, networks and their regulatory
mechanisms become cumbersome to test. Furthermore, prodding through
experimental results requires an enormous amount of computation, resulting in
slow data processing. Therefore, new approaches are needed to expeditiously
analyze copious amounts of experimental data resulting from cellular GRNs. To
meet this need, cloud computing is promising as reported in the literature.
Here we propose new MapReduce algorithms for inferring gene regulatory networks
on a Hadoop cluster in a cloud environment. These algorithms employ an
information-theoretic approach to infer GRNs using time-series microarray data.
Experimental results show that our MapReduce program is much faster than an
existing tool while achieving slightly better prediction accuracy than the
existing tool.

 <dc:description>  Various motivations exist to move away from the simple assessment of
knowledge towards the more complex assessment and development of competence.
However, to accommodate such a change, high demands are put on the supporting
e-infrastructure in terms of intelligently collecting and analysing data. In
this paper, we discuss these challenges and how they are being addressed by
LiftUpp, a system that is now used in 70% of UK dental schools, and is finding
wider applications in physiotherapy, medicine and veterinary science. We
describe how data is collected for workplace-based development in dentistry
using a dedicated iPad app, which enables an integrated approach to linking and
assessing work flows, skills and learning outcomes. Furthermore, we detail how
the various forms of collected data can be fused, visualized and integrated
with conventional forms of assessment. This enables curriculum integration,
improved real-time student feedback, support for administration, and informed
instructional planning. Together these facets contribute to better support for
the development of learners' competence in situated learning setting, as well
as an improved experience. Finally, we discuss several directions for future
research on intelligent teaching systems that are afforded by using the design
present within LiftUpp.

 <dc:title>PQTable: Non-exhaustive Fast Search for Product-quantized Codes using

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a product quantization table (PQTable); a fast
search method for product-quantized codes via hash-tables. An identifier of
each database vector is associated with the slot of a hash table by using its
PQ-code as a key. For querying, an input vector is PQ-encoded and hashed, and
the items associated with that code are then retrieved. The proposed PQTable
produces the same results as a linear PQ scan, and is 10^2 to 10^5 times
faster. Although state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by previous
inverted-indexing-based approaches, such methods require manually-designed
parameter setting and significant training; our PQTable is free of these
limitations, and therefore offers a practical and effective solution for
real-world problems. Specifically, when the vectors are highly compressed, our
PQTable achieves one of the fastest search performances on a single CPU to date
with significantly efficient memory usage (0.059 ms per query over 10^9 data
points with just 5.5 GB memory consumption). Finally, we show that our proposed
PQTable can naturally handle the codes of an optimized product quantization
(OPQTable).

 <dc:description>  Modeling attention in neural multi-source sequence-to-sequence learning
remains a relatively unexplored area, despite its usefulness in tasks that
incorporate multiple source languages or modalities. We propose two novel
approaches to combine the outputs of attention mechanisms over each source
sequence, flat and hierarchical. We compare the proposed methods with existing
techniques and present results of systematic evaluation of those methods on the
WMT16 Multimodal Translation and Automatic Post-editing tasks. We show that the
proposed methods achieve competitive results on both tasks.

 <dc:description>  Domain Name System (DNS), one of the important infrastructure in the
Internet, was vulnerable to attacks, for the DNS designer didn't take security
issues into consideration at the beginning. The defects of DNS may lead to
users' failure of access to the websites, what's worse, users might suffer a
huge economic loss.
  In order to correct the DNS wrong resource records, we propose a
Self-Feedback Correction System for DNS (SFCSD), which can find and track a
large number of common websites' domain name and IP address correct
correspondences to provide users with a real-time auto-updated correct (IP,
Domain) binary tuple list. By matching specific strings with SSL, DNS and HTTP
traffic passively, filtering with the CDN CNAME and non-homepage URL feature
strings, verifying with webpage fingerprint algorithm, SFCSD obtains a large
number of highly possibly correct IP addresses to make an active manual
correction in the end. Its self-feedback mechanism can expand search range and
improve performance.
  Experiments show that, SFCSD can achieve 94.3% precision and 93.07% recall
rate with the optimal threshold selection in the test dataset. It has 8Gbps
processing speed stand-alone to find almost 1000 possibly correct (IP, Domain)
per day for the each specific string and to correct almost 200.

 <dc:description>  Location recognition is commonly treated as visual instance retrieval on
&quot;street view&quot; imagery. The dataset items and queries are panoramic views, i.e.
groups of images taken at a single location. This work introduces a novel
panorama-to-panorama matching process, either by aggregating features of
individual images in a group or by explicitly constructing a larger panorama.
In either case, multiple views are used as queries. We reach near perfect
location recognition on a standard benchmark with only four query views.

external stimuli, delay and decay of postsynaptic potentials, modification of
internal weights due to propagation of postsynaptic potentials through the
dendrite, modification of properties of the analog memory for each input due to
a pattern of short-time synaptic potentiation or long-time synaptic
potentiation (LTP), output-spike generation when the sum of all inputs exceeds
a threshold, and refraction. The cell may take one of the three forms:
excitatory, inhibitory, and receptory. The computer simulations showed that,
depending on the phase of input signals, the artificial neuron's output
frequency may demonstrate various chaotic behaviors.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The task of object viewpoint estimation has been a challenge since the early
days of computer vision. To estimate the viewpoint (or pose) of an object,
people have mostly looked at object intrinsic features, such as shape or
appearance. Surprisingly, informative features provided by other, extrinsic
elements in the scene, have so far mostly been ignored. At the same time,
contextual cues have been proven to be of great benefit for related tasks such
as object detection or action recognition. In this paper, we explore how
information from other objects in the scene can be exploited for viewpoint
estimation. In particular, we look at object configurations by following a
relational neighbor-based approach for reasoning about object relations. We
show that, starting from noisy object detections and viewpoint estimates,
exploiting the estimated viewpoint and location of other objects in the scene
can lead to improved object viewpoint predictions. Experiments on the KITTI
dataset demonstrate that object configurations can indeed be used as a
complementary cue to appearance-based viewpoint estimation. Our analysis
reveals that the proposed context-based method can improve object viewpoint
estimation by reducing specific types of viewpoint estimation errors commonly
made by methods that only consider local information. Moreover, considering
contextual information produces superior performance in scenes where a high
number of object instances occur. Finally, our results suggest that, following
a cautious relational neighbor formulation brings improvements over its
aggressive counterpart for the task of object viewpoint estimation.

 <dc:description>  Empirically, neural networks that attempt to learn programs from data have
exhibited poor generalizability. Moreover, it has traditionally been difficult
to reason about the behavior of these models beyond a certain level of input
complexity. In order to address these issues, we propose augmenting neural
architectures with a key abstraction: recursion. As an application, we
implement recursion in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter framework on four
tasks: grade-school addition, bubble sort, topological sort, and quicksort. We
demonstrate superior generalizability and interpretability with small amounts
of training data. Recursion divides the problem into smaller pieces and
drastically reduces the domain of each neural network component, making it
tractable to prove guarantees about the overall system's behavior. Our
experience suggests that in order for neural architectures to robustly learn
program semantics, it is necessary to incorporate a concept like recursion.

 <dc:description>  Humans can ground natural language commands to tasks at both abstract and
fine-grained levels of specificity. For instance, a human forklift operator can
be instructed to perform a high-level action, like &quot;grab a pallet&quot; or a
lowlevel action like &quot;tilt back a little bit.&quot; While robots are also capable of
grounding language commands to tasks, previous methods implicitly assume that
all commands and tasks reside at a single, fixed level of abstraction.
Additionally, those approaches that do not use abstraction experience
inefficient planning and execution times due to the large, intractable
state-action spaces, which closely resemble real world complexity. In this
work, by grounding commands to all the tasks or subtasks available in a
hierarchical planning framework, we arrive at a model capable of interpreting
language at multiple levels of specificity ranging from coarse to more
granular. We show that the accuracy of the grounding procedure is improved when
simultaneously inferring the degree of abstraction in language used to
communicate the task. Leveraging hierarchy also improves efficiency: our
proposed approach enables a robot to respond to a command within one second on
90% of our tasks, while baselines take over twenty seconds on half the tasks.
Finally, we demonstrate that a real, physical robot can ground commands at
multiple levels of abstraction allowing it to efficiently plan different
subtasks within the same planning hierarchy.

 <dc:description>  We propose a summarization approach for scientific articles which takes
advantage of citation-context and the document discourse model. While citations
have been previously used in generating scientific summaries, they lack the
related context from the referenced article and therefore do not accurately
reflect the article's content. Our method overcomes the problem of
inconsistency between the citation summary and the article's content by
providing context for each citation. We also leverage the inherent scientific
article's discourse for producing better summaries. We show that our proposed
method effectively improves over existing summarization approaches (greater
than 30% improvement over the best performing baseline) in terms of
\textsc{Rouge} scores on TAC2014 scientific summarization dataset. While the
dataset we use for evaluation is in the biomedical domain, most of our
approaches are general and therefore adaptable to other domains.

 <dc:title>A hybrid spatial data mining approach based on fuzzy topological

 <dc:description>  Making high-quality decisions in strategic spatial planning is heavily
dependent on extracting knowledge from vast amounts of data. Although many
decision-making problems like developing urban areas require such perception
and reasoning, existing methods in this field usually neglect the deep
knowledge mined from geographic databases and are based on pure statistical
methods. Due to the large volume of data gathered in spatial databases, and the
uncertainty of spatial objects, mining association rules for high-level
knowledge representation is a challenging task. Few algorithms manage
geographical and non-geographical data using topological relations. In this
paper, a novel approach for spatial data mining based on the MOSES evolutionary
framework is presented which improves the classic genetic programming approach.
A hybrid architecture called GGeo is proposed to apply the MOSES mining rules
considering fuzzy topological relations from spatial data. The uncertainty and
fuzziness aspects are addressed using an enriched model of topological
relations by fuzzy region connection calculus. Moreover, to overcome the
problem of time-consuming fuzzy topological relationships calculations, this a
novel data pre-processing method is offered. GGeo analyses and learns from
geographical and non-geographical data and uses topological and distance
parameters, and returns a series of arithmetic-spatial formulas as
classification rules. The proposed approach is resistant to noisy data, and all
its stages run in parallel to increase speed. This approach may be used in
different spatial data classification problems as well as representing an
appropriate method of data analysis and economic policy making.

 <dc:description>  We study several problems related to graph modification problems under
connectivity constraints from the perspective of parameterized complexity: {\sc
(Weighted) Biconnectivity Deletion}, where we are tasked with deleting~$k$
edges while preserving biconnectivity in an undirected graph, {\sc
Vertex-deletion Preserving Strong Connectivity}, where we want to maintain
strong connectivity of a digraph while deleting exactly~$k$ vertices, and {\sc
Path-contraction Preserving Strong Connectivity}, in which the operation of
path contraction on arcs is used instead. The parameterized tractability of
this last problem was posed by Bang-Jensen and Yeo [DAM 2008] as an open
question and we answer it here in the negative: both variants of preserving
strong connectivity are $\sf W[1]$-hard. Preserving biconnectivity, on the
other hand, turns out to be fixed parameter tractable and we provide a
$2^{O(k\log k)} n^{O(1)}$-algorithm that solves {\sc Weighted Biconnectivity
Deletion}. Further, we show that the unweighted case even admits a randomized
polynomial kernel. All our results provide further interesting data points for
the systematic study of connectivity-preservation constraints in the
parameterized setting.

 <dc:description>  With the surge of multi- and manycores, much research has focused on
algorithms for mapping and scheduling on these complex platforms. Large classes
of these algorithms face scalability problems. This is why diverse methods are
commonly used for reducing the search space. While most such approaches
leverage the inherent symmetry of architectures and applications, they do it in
a problem-specific and intuitive way. However, intuitive approaches become
impractical with growing hardware complexity, like Network-on-Chip interconnect
or heterogeneous cores. In this paper, we present a formal framework that can
determine the inherent symmetry of architectures and applications
algorithmically and leverage these for problems in software synthesis. Our
approach is based on the mathematical theory of groups and a generalization
called inverse semigroups. We evaluate our approach in two state-of-the-art
mapping frameworks. Even for the platforms with a handful of cores of today and
moderate-size benchmarks, our approach consistently yields reductions of the
overall execution time of algorithms, accelerating them by a factor up to 10 in
our experiments, or improving the quality of the results.

 <dc:title>Learned D-AMP: Principled Neural Network based Compressive Image
  Recovery</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Compressive image recovery is a challenging problem that requires fast and
accurate algorithms. Recently, neural networks have been applied to this
problem with promising results. By exploiting massively parallel GPU processing
architectures and oodles of training data, they can run orders of magnitude
faster than existing techniques. However, these methods are largely
unprincipled black boxes that are difficult to train and often-times specific
to a single measurement matrix.
  It was recently demonstrated that iterative sparse-signal-recovery algorithms
can be &quot;unrolled&quot; to form interpretable deep networks. Taking inspiration from
this work, we develop a novel neural network architecture that mimics the
behavior of the denoising-based approximate message passing (D-AMP) algorithm.
We call this new network Learned D-AMP (LDAMP).
  The LDAMP network is easy to train, can be applied to a variety of different
measurement matrices, and comes with a state-evolution heuristic that
accurately predicts its performance. Most importantly, it outperforms the
state-of-the-art BM3D-AMP and NLR-CS algorithms in terms of both accuracy and
run time. At high resolutions, and when used with sensing matrices that have
fast implementations, LDAMP runs over $50\times$ faster than BM3D-AMP and
hundreds of times faster than NLR-CS.

 <dc:description>  We study the potential employment of improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) in
full-duplex relaying (FDR) with non-negligible residual self-interference (RSI)
under Nakagami- m fading. IGS is recently shown to outperform traditional
proper Gaussian signaling (PGS) in several interference-limited settings. In
this work, IGS is employed as an attempt to alleviate RSI. We use two
performance metrics, namely, the outage probability and the ergodic rate.
First, we provide upper and lower bounds for the system performance in terms of
the relay transmit power and circularity coefficient, a measure of the signal
impropriety. Then, we numerically optimize the relay signal parameters based
only on the channel statistics to improve the system performance. Based on the
analysis, IGS allows FDR to operate even with high RSI. The results show that
IGS can leverage higher power budgets to enhance the performance, meanwhile it
relieves RSI impact via tuning the signal impropriety. Interestingly,
one-dimensional optimization of the circularity coefficient, with maximum relay
power, offers a similar performance as the joint optimization, which reduces
the optimization complexity. From a throughput standpoint, it is shown that
IGS-FDR can outperform not only PGS-FDR, but also half-duplex relaying
with/without maximum ratio combining over certain regions of the target source
rate.

 <dc:title>Feed-forward approximations to dynamic recurrent network architectures</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Muir, Dylan Richard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Quantitative Biology - Neurons and Cognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural network architectures can have useful computational
properties, with complex temporal dynamics and input-sensitive attractor
states. However, evaluation of recurrent dynamic architectures requires
solution of systems of differential equations, and the number of evaluations
required to determine their response to a given input can vary with the input,
or can be indeterminate altogether in the case of oscillations or instability.
In feed-forward networks, by contrast, only a single pass through the network
is needed to determine the response to a given input. Modern machine-learning
systems are designed to operate efficiently on feed-forward architectures. We
hypothesised that two-layer feedforward architectures with simple,
deterministic dynamics could approximate the responses of single-layer
recurrent network architectures. By identifying the fixed-point responses of a
given recurrent network, we trained two-layer networks to directly approximate
the fixed-point response to a given input. These feed-forward networks then
embodied useful computations, including competitive interactions, information
transformations and noise rejection. Our approach was able to find useful
approximations to recurrent networks, which can then be evaluated in linear and
deterministic time complexity.

 <dc:description>  Markov automata combine non-determinism, probabilistic branching, and
exponentially distributed delays. This compositional variant of continuous-time
Markov decision processes is used in reliability engineering, performance
evaluation and stochastic scheduling. Their verification so far focused on
single objectives such as (timed) reachability, and expected costs. In
practice, often the objectives are mutually dependent and the aim is to reveal
trade-offs. We present algorithms to analyze several objectives simultaneously
and approximate Pareto curves. This includes, e.g., several (timed)
reachability objectives, or various expected cost objectives. We also consider
combinations thereof, such as on-time-within-budget objectives - which policies
guarantee reaching a goal state within a deadline with at least probability $p$
while keeping the allowed average costs below a threshold? We adopt existing
approaches for classical Markov decision processes. The main challenge is to
treat policies exploiting state residence times, even for untimed objectives.
Experimental results show the feasibility and scalability of our approach.

 <dc:description>  This dissertation is motivated by the need, in today's globalist world, for a
precise way to enable governments, organisations and other regulatory bodies to
evaluate the constraints they place on themselves and others. An organisation's
modus operandi is enacting and fulfilling contracts between itself and its
participants. Yet, organisational contracts should respect external laws, such
as those setting out data privacy rights and liberties. Contracts can only be
enacted by following contract law processes, which often require bilateral
agreement and consideration. Governments need to legislate whilst understanding
today's context of national and international governance hierarchy where law
makers shun isolationism and seek to influence one another. Governments should
avoid punishment by respecting constraints from international treaties and
human rights charters. Governments can only enact legislation by following
their own, pre-existing, law making procedures. In other words, institutions,
such as laws and contracts are designed and enacted under constraints.

 <dc:description>  We revisit the mathematical models for wireless network jamming introduced by
Commander et al.: we first point out the strong connections with classical
wireless network design and then we propose a new model based on the explicit
use of signal-to-interference quantities. Moreover, to address the intrinsic
uncertain nature of the jamming problem and tackle the peculiar right-hand-side
(RHS) uncertainty of the problem, we propose an original robust cutting-plane
algorithm drawing inspiration from Multiband Robust Optimization. Finally, we
assess the performance of the proposed cutting plane algorithm by experiments
on realistic network instances.

 <dc:description>  We propose a pure 0-1 formulation for the wireless network design problem,
i.e. the problem of configuring a set of transmitters to provide service
coverage to a set of receivers. In contrast with classical mixed integer
formulations, where power emissions are represented by continuous variables, we
consider only a finite set of powers values. This has two major advantages: it
better fits the usual practice and eliminates the sources of numerical problems
which heavily affect continuous models. A crucial ingredient of our approach is
an effective basic formulation for the single knapsack problem representing the
coverage condition of a receiver. This formulation is based on the GUB cover
inequalities introduced by Wolsey (1990) and its core is an extension of the
exact formulation of the GUB knapsack polytope with two GUB constraints. This
special case corresponds to the very common practical situation where only one
major interferer is present. We assess the effectiveness of our formulation by
comprehensive computational results over realistic instances of two typical
technologies, namely WiMAX and DVB-T.

 <dc:title>Multi-Objective Deep Q-Learning with Subsumption Architecture</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this work we present a method for using Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) in
multi-objective tasks. Deep Q-Networks provide remarkable performance in single
objective tasks learning from high-level visual perception. However, in many
scenarios (e.g in robotics), the agent needs to pursue multiple objectives
simultaneously. We propose an architecture in which separate DQNs are used to
control the agent's behaviour with respect to particular objectives. In this
architecture we use signal suppression, known from the (Brooks) subsumption
architecture, to combine outputs of several DQNs into a single action. Our
architecture enables the decomposition of the agent's behaviour into
controllable and replaceable sub-behaviours learned by distinct modules. To
evaluate our solution we used a game-like simulator in which an agent -
provided with high-level visual input - pursues multiple objectives in a 2D
world. Our solution provides benefits of modularity, while its performance is
comparable to the monolithic approach.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a new online scheduling framework for minimizing
total weighted completion time in a general setting. The framework is inspired
by the work of Hall et al. [Mathematics of Operations Research, Vol
22(3):513-544, 1997] and Garg et al. [Proc. of Foundations of Software
Technology and Theoretical Computer Science, pp. 96-107, 2007], who show how to
convert an offline approximation to an online scheme. Our framework uses two
offline approximation algorithms (one for the simpler problem of scheduling
without release times, and another for the minimum unscheduled weight problem)
to create an online algorithm with provably good competitive ratios.
  We illustrate multiple applications of this method that yield improved
competitive ratios. Our framework gives algorithms with the best or only known
competitive ratios for the concurrent open shop, coflow, and concurrent cluster
models. We also introduce a randomized variant of our framework based on the
ideas of Chakrabarti et al. [Proc. of International Colloquium on Automata,
Languages, and Programming, pp. 646-657, 1996] and use it to achieve improved
competitive ratios for these same problems.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a cost-effective strategy to simulate the behavior of
laminated plates by means of isogeometric 3D solid elements. Exploiting the
high continuity of spline functions and their properties, a proper out-of-plane
stress state is recovered from a coarse displacement solution using a
post-processing step based on the enforcement of equilibrium in strong form.
Appealing results are obtained and the method is shown to be particularly
Peffective on slender composite stacks with a large number of layers.

 <dc:description>  We show that by restricting the degrees of the vertices of a graph to an
arbitrary set \( \Delta \), the threshold point $ \alpha(\Delta) $ of the phase
transition for a random graph with $ n $ vertices and $ m = \alpha(\Delta) n $
edges can be either accelerated (e.g., $ \alpha(\Delta) \approx 0.381 $ for $
\Delta = \{0,1,4,5\} $) or postponed (e.g., $ \alpha(\{ 2^0, 2^1, \cdots, 2^k,
\cdots \}) \approx 0.795 $) compared to a classical Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi random
graph with $ \alpha(\mathbb Z_{\geq 0}) = \tfrac12 $. In particular, we prove
that the probability of graph being nonplanar and the probability of having a
complex component, goes from $ 0 $ to $ 1 $ as $ m $ passes $ \alpha(\Delta) n
$. We investigate these probabilities and also different graph statistics
inside the critical window of transition (diameter, longest path and
circumference of a complex component).

 <dc:description>  Base station cooperation (BSC) has recently arisen as a promising way to
increase the capacity of a wireless network. Implementing BSC adds a new design
dimension to the classical wireless network design problem: how to define the
subset of base stations (clusters) that coordinate to serve a user. Though the
problem of forming clusters has been extensively discussed from a technical
point of view, there is still a lack of effective optimization models for its
representation and algorithms for its solution. In this work, we make a further
step towards filling such gap: 1) we generalize the classical network design
problem by adding cooperation as an additional decision dimension; 2) we
develop a strong formulation for the resulting problem; 3) we define a new
hybrid solution algorithm that combines exact large neighborhood search and ant
colony optimization. Finally, we assess the performance of our new model and
algorithm on a set of realistic instances of a WiMAX network.

 <dc:description>  Charts are an excellent way to convey patterns and trends in data, but they
do not facilitate further modeling of the data or close inspection of
individual data points. We present a fully automated system for extracting the
numerical values of data points from images of scatter plots. We use deep
learning techniques to identify the key components of the chart, and optical
character recognition together with robust regression to map from pixels to the
coordinate system of the chart. We focus on scatter plots with linear scales,
which already have several interesting challenges. Previous work has done fully
automatic extraction for other types of charts, but to our knowledge this is
the first approach that is fully automatic for scatter plots. Our method
performs well, achieving successful data extraction on 89% of the plots in our
test set.

 <dc:description>  Count-based distributional semantic models suffer from sparsity due to
unobserved but plausible co-occurrences in any text collection. This problem is
amplified for models like Anchored Packed Trees (APTs), that take the
grammatical type of a co-occurrence into account. We therefore introduce a
novel form of distributional inference that exploits the rich type structure in
APTs and infers missing data by the same mechanism that is used for semantic
composition.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel face synthesis approach that can generate
an arbitrarily large number of synthetic images of both real and synthetic
identities. Thus a face image dataset can be expanded in terms of the number of
identities represented and the number of images per identity using this
approach, without the identity-labeling and privacy complications that come
from downloading images from the web. To measure the visual fidelity and
uniqueness of the synthetic face images and identities, we conducted face
matching experiments with both human participants and a CNN pre-trained on a
dataset of 2.6M real face images. To evaluate the stability of these synthetic
faces, we trained a CNN model with an augmented dataset containing close to
200,000 synthetic faces. We used a snapshot of this trained CNN to recognize
extremely challenging frontal (real) face images. Experiments showed training
with the augmented faces boosted the face recognition performance of the CNN.

 <dc:title>On Improving Research Methodology Course at Blekinge Institute of

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Research Methodology in Software Engineering and Computer Science (RM) is
a compulsory course that must be studied by graduate students at Blekinge
Institute of Technology (BTH) prior to undertaking their theses work. The
course is focused on teaching research methods and techniques for data
collection and analysis in the fields of Computer Science and Software
Engineering. It is intended that the course should help students in practically
applying appropriate research methods in different courses (in addition to the
RM course) including their Master's theses. However, it is believed that there
exist deficiencies in the course due to which the course implementation
(learning and assessment activities) as well as the performance of different
participants (students, teachers, and evaluators) are affected negatively. In
this article our aim is to investigate potential deficiencies in the RM course
at BTH in order to provide a concrete evidence on the deficiencies faced by
students, evaluators, and teachers in the course. Additionally, we suggest
recommendations for resolving the identified deficiencies. Our findings
gathered through semi-structured interviews with students, teachers, and
evaluators in the course are presented in this article. By identifying a total
of twenty one deficiencies from different perspectives, we found that there
exist critical deficiencies at different levels within the course. Furthermore,
in order to overcome the identified deficiencies, we suggest seven
recommendations that may be implemented at different levels within the course
and the study program. Our suggested recommendations, if implemented, will help
in resolving deficiencies in the course, which may lead to achieving an
improved teaching and learning in the RM course at BTH.

 <dc:description>  In insertion-only streaming, one sees a sequence of indices $a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_m\in [n]$. The stream defines a sequence of $m$ frequency vectors
$x^{(1)},\ldots,x^{(m)}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ with $(x^{(t)})_i = |\{j : j\in[t], a_j
= i\}|$. That is, $x^{(t)}$ is the frequency vector after seeing the first $t$
items in the stream. Much work in the streaming literature focuses on
estimating some function $f(x^{(m)})$. Many applications though require
obtaining estimates at time $t$ of $f(x^{(t)})$, for every $t\in[m]$. Naively
this guarantee is obtained by devising an algorithm with failure probability
$\ll 1/m$, then performing a union bound over all stream updates to guarantee
that all $m$ estimates are simultaneously accurate with good probability. When
$f(x)$ is some $\ell_p$ norm of $x$, recent works have shown that this union
bound is wasteful and better space complexity is possible for the continuous
monitoring problem, with the strongest known results being for $p=2$ [HTY14,
BCIW16, BCINWW17]. In this work, we improve the state of the art for all
$0&lt;p&lt;2$, which we obtain via a novel analysis of Indyk's $p$-stable sketch
[Indyk06].

 <dc:description>  Today, with the continued growth in using information and communication
technologies (ICT) for business purposes, business organizations become
increasingly dependent on their information systems. Thus, they need to protect
them from the different attacks exploiting their vulnerabilities. To do so, the
organization has to use security technologies, which may be proactive or
reactive ones. Each security technology has a relative cost and addresses
specific vulnerabilities. Therefore, the organization has to put in place the
appropriate security technologies set that minimizes the information system s
vulnerabilities with a minimal cost. This bi objective problem will be
considered as a resources allocation problem (RAP) where security technologies
represent the resources to be allocated. However, the set of vulnerabilities
may change, periodically, with the continual appearance of new ones. Therefore,
the security technologies set should be flexible to face these changes, in real
time, and the problem becomes a dynamic one. In this paper, we propose a
harmony search based algorithm to solve the bi objective dynamic resource
allocation decision model. This approach was compared to a genetic algorithm
and provided good results.

 <dc:description>  Network Function Virtualization (NFV) aims to simplify deployment of network
services by running Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on commercial
off-the-shelf servers. Service deployment involves placement of VNFs and
in-sequence routing of traffic flows through VNFs comprising a Service Chain
(SC). The joint VNF placement and traffic routing is usually referred as SC
mapping. In a Wide Area Network (WAN), a situation may arise where several
traffic flows, generated by many distributed node pairs, require the same SC,
one single instance (or occurrence) of that SC might not be enough. SC mapping
with multiple SC instances for the same SC turns out to be a very complex
problem, since the sequential traversal of VNFs has to be maintained while
accounting for traffic flows in various directions. Our study is the first to
deal with SC mapping with multiple SC instances to minimize network resource
consumption. Exact mathematical modeling of this problem results in a quadratic
formulation. We propose a two-phase column-generation-based model and solution
in order to get results over large network topologies within reasonable
computational times. Using such an approach, we observe that an appropriate
choice of only a small set of SC instances can lead to solution very close to
the minimum bandwidth consumption.

 <dc:description>  Data fusion has become an active research topic in recent years. Growing
computational performance has allowed the use of redundant sensors to measure a
single phenomenon. While Bayesian fusion approaches are common in general
applications, the computer vision field has largely relegated this approach.
Most object following algorithms have gone towards pure machine learning fusion
techniques that tend to lack flexibility. Consequently, a more general data
fusion scheme is needed. Within this work, a hierarchical Bayesian fusion
approach is proposed, which outperforms individual trackers by using redundant
measurements. The adaptive framework is achieved by relying on each
measurement's local statistics and a global softened majority voting. The
proposed approach was validated in a simulated application and two robotic
platforms.

 <dc:description>  We tackle the challenge of topic classification of tweets in the context of
analyzing a large collection of curated streams by news outlets and other
organizations to deliver relevant content to users. Our approach is novel in
applying distant supervision based on semi-automatically identifying curated
streams that are topically focused (for example, on politics, entertainment, or
sports). These streams provide a source of labeled data to train topic
classifiers that can then be applied to categorize tweets from more
topically-diffuse streams. Experiments on both noisy labels and human
ground-truth judgments demonstrate that our approach yields good topic
classifiers essentially &quot;for free&quot;, and that topic classifiers trained in this
manner are able to dynamically adjust for topic drift as news on Twitter
evolves.

 <dc:description>  We show that even when face images are unconstrained and arbitrarily paired,
face swapping between them is actually quite simple. To this end, we make the
following contributions. (a) Instead of tailoring systems for face
segmentation, as others previously proposed, we show that a standard fully
convolutional network (FCN) can achieve remarkably fast and accurate
segmentations, provided that it is trained on a rich enough example set. For
this purpose, we describe novel data collection and generation routines which
provide challenging segmented face examples. (b) We use our segmentations to
enable robust face swapping under unprecedented conditions. (c) Unlike previous
work, our swapping is robust enough to allow for extensive quantitative tests.
To this end, we use the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) benchmark and measure
the effect of intra- and inter-subject face swapping on recognition. We show
that our intra-subject swapped faces remain as recognizable as their sources,
testifying to the effectiveness of our method. In line with well known
perceptual studies, we show that better face swapping produces less
recognizable inter-subject results. This is the first time this effect was
quantitatively demonstrated for machine vision systems.

 <dc:description>  We propose Batch-Expansion Training (BET), a framework for running a batch
optimizer on a gradually expanding dataset. As opposed to stochastic
approaches, batches do not need to be resampled i.i.d. at every iteration, thus
making BET more resource efficient in a distributed setting, and when
disk-access is constrained. Moreover, BET can be easily paired with most batch
optimizers, does not require any parameter-tuning, and compares favorably to
existing stochastic and batch methods. We show that when the batch size grows
exponentially with the number of outer iterations, BET achieves optimal
$O(1/\epsilon)$ data-access convergence rate for strongly convex objectives.
Experiments in parallel and distributed settings show that BET performs better
than standard batch and stochastic approaches.

 <dc:description>  Many cluster management systems (CMSs) have been proposed to share a single
cluster with multiple distributed computing systems. However, none of the
existing approaches can handle distributed machine learning (ML) workloads
given the following criteria: high resource utilization, fair resource
allocation and low sharing overhead. To solve this problem, we propose a new
CMS named Dorm, incorporating a dynamically-partitioned cluster management
mechanism and an utilization-fairness optimizer. Specifically, Dorm uses the
container-based virtualization technique to partition a cluster, runs one
application per partition, and can dynamically resize each partition at
application runtime for resource efficiency and fairness. Each application
directly launches its tasks on the assigned partition without petitioning for
resources frequently, so Dorm imposes flat sharing overhead. Extensive
performance evaluations showed that Dorm could simultaneously increase the
resource utilization by a factor of up to 2.32, reduce the fairness loss by a
factor of up to 1.52, and speed up popular distributed ML applications by a
factor of up to 2.72, compared to existing approaches. Dorm's sharing overhead
is less than 5% in most cases.

 <dc:title>Testing Network Structure Using Relations Between Small Subgraph

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of testing for structure in networks using relations
between the observed frequencies of small subgraphs. We consider the statistics
\begin{align*} T_3 &amp; =(\text{edge frequency})^3 - \text{triangle frequency}\\
T_2 &amp; =3(\text{edge frequency})^2(1-\text{edge frequency}) - \text{V-shape
frequency} \end{align*} and prove a central limit theorem for $(T_2, T_3)$
under an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi null model. We then analyze the power of the
associated $\chi^2$ test statistic under a general class of alternative models.
In particular, when the alternative is a $k$-community stochastic block model,
with $k$ unknown, the power of the test approaches one. Moreover, the
signal-to-noise ratio required is strictly weaker than that required for
community detection. We also study the relation with other statistics over
three-node subgraphs, and analyze the error under two natural algorithms for
sampling small subgraphs. Together, our results show how global structural
characteristics of networks can be inferred from local subgraph frequencies,
without requiring the global community structure to be explicitly estimated.

 <dc:description>  PCA is a classical statistical technique whose simplicity and maturity has
seen it find widespread use as an anomaly detection technique. However, it is
limited in this regard by being sensitive to gross perturbations of the input,
and by seeking a linear subspace that captures normal behaviour. The first
issue has been dealt with by robust PCA, a variant of PCA that explicitly
allows for some data points to be arbitrarily corrupted, however, this does not
resolve the second issue, and indeed introduces the new issue that one can no
longer inductively find anomalies on a test set. This paper addresses both
issues in a single model, the robust autoencoder. This method learns a
nonlinear subspace that captures the majority of data points, while allowing
for some data to have arbitrary corruption. The model is simple to train and
leverages recent advances in the optimisation of deep neural networks.
Experiments on a range of real-world datasets highlight the model's
effectiveness.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the fundamental problem of distribution and proactive caching
of computing tasks in fog networks is studied under latency and reliability
constraints. In the proposed scenario, computing can be executed either locally
at the user device or offloaded to an edge cloudlet. Moreover, cloudlets
exploit both their computing and storage capabilities by proactively caching
popular task computation results to minimize computing latency. To this end, a
clustering method to group spatially proximate user devices with mutual task
popularity interests and their serving cloudlets is proposed. Then, cloudlets
can proactively cache the popular tasks' computations of their cluster members
to minimize computing latency. Additionally, the problem of distributing tasks
to cloudlets is formulated as a matching game in which a cost function of
computing delay is minimized under latency and reliability constraints.
Simulation results show that the proposed scheme guarantees reliable
computations with bounded latency and achieves up to 91% decrease in computing
latency as compared to baseline schemes.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by product detection in supermarkets, this paper studies the
problem of object proposal generation in supermarket images and other natural
images. We argue that estimation of object scales in images is helpful for
generating object proposals, especially for supermarket images where object
scales are usually within a small range. Therefore, we propose to estimate
object scales of images before generating object proposals. The proposed method
for predicting object scales is called ScaleNet. To validate the effectiveness
of ScaleNet, we build three supermarket datasets, two of which are real-world
datasets used for testing and the other one is a synthetic dataset used for
training. In short, we extend the previous state-of-the-art object proposal
methods by adding a scale prediction phase. The resulted method outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art on the supermarket datasets by a large margin. We
also show that the approach works for object proposal on other natural images
and it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art object proposal methods on the
MS COCO dataset. The supermarket datasets, the virtual supermarkets, and the
tools for creating more synthetic datasets will be made public.

 <dc:description>  We have developed convolutional neural networks (CNN) for a facial expression
recognition task. The goal is to classify each facial image into one of the
seven facial emotion categories considered in this study. We trained CNN models
with different depth using gray-scale images. We developed our models in Torch
and exploited Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computation in order to expedite
the training process. In addition to the networks performing based on raw pixel
data, we employed a hybrid feature strategy by which we trained a novel CNN
model with the combination of raw pixel data and Histogram of Oriented
Gradients (HOG) features. To reduce the overfitting of the models, we utilized
different techniques including dropout and batch normalization in addition to
L2 regularization. We applied cross validation to determine the optimal
hyper-parameters and evaluated the performance of the developed models by
looking at their training histories. We also present the visualization of
different layers of a network to show what features of a face can be learned by
CNN models.

 <dc:description>  It has long been known that Feedback Vertex Set can be solved in time
$2^{\mathcal{O}(w\log w)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ on graphs of treewidth $w$, but it
was only recently that this running time was improved to
$2^{\mathcal{O}(w)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, that is, to single-exponential
parameterized by treewidth. We investigate which generalizations of Feedback
Vertex Set can be solved in a similar running time. Formally, for a class of
graphs $\mathcal{P}$, the Bounded $\mathcal{P}$-Block Vertex Deletion problem
asks, given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and positive integers $k$ and $d$,
whether $G$ contains a set $S$ of at most $k$ vertices such that each block of
$G-S$ has at most $d$ vertices and is in $\mathcal{P}$. Assuming that
$\mathcal{P}$ is recognizable in polynomial time and satisfies a certain
natural hereditary condition, we give a sharp characterization of when
single-exponential parameterized algorithms are possible for fixed values of
$d$: (1) if $\mathcal{P}$ consists only of chordal graphs, then the problem can
be solved in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(wd^2)} n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, (2) if
$\mathcal{P}$ contains a graph with an induced cycle of length $\ell\ge 4$,
then the problem is not solvable in time $2^{o(w\log w)} n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$
even for fixed $d=\ell$, unless the ETH fails. We also study a similar problem,
called Bounded $\mathcal{P}$-Component Vertex Deletion, where the target graphs
have connected components of small size instead of having blocks of small size,
and we show analogous results. For this problem, we further show that if $d$ is
a part of the input and $\mathcal{P}$ contains all chordal graphs, then it
cannot be solved in time $f(w)n^{o(w)}$ for some function $f$, unless ETH
fails.

 <dc:title>Content-Based Video-Music Retrieval Using Soft Intra-Modal Structure
  Constraint</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Up to now, only limited research has been conducted on cross-modal retrieval
of suitable music for a specified video or vice versa. Moreover, much of the
existing research relies on metadata such as keywords, tags, or associated
description that must be individually produced and attached posterior. This
paper introduces a new content-based, cross-modal retrieval method for video
and music that is implemented through deep neural networks. We train the
network via inter-modal ranking loss such that videos and music with similar
semantics end up close together in the embedding space. However, if only the
inter-modal ranking constraint is used for embedding, modality-specific
characteristics can be lost. To address this problem, we propose a novel soft
intra-modal structure loss that leverages the relative distance relationship
between intra-modal samples before embedding. We also introduce reasonable
quantitative and qualitative experimental protocols to solve the lack of
standard protocols for less-mature video-music related tasks. Finally, we
construct a large-scale 200K video-music pair benchmark. All the datasets and
source code can be found in our online repository
(https://github.com/csehong/VM-NET).

 <dc:title>Multiuser Millimeter Wave MIMO Channel Estimation with Hybrid

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on multiuser MIMO channel estimation and data transmission
at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. The proposed approach relies on the
time-division-duplex (TDD) protocol and is based on two distinct phases. First
of all, the Base Station (BS) sends a suitable probing signal so that all the
Mobile Stations (MSs), using a subspace tracking algorithm, can estimate the
dominant left singular vectors of their BS-to-MS propagation channel. Then,
each MS, using the estimated dominant left singular vectors as pre-coding
beamformers, sends a suitable pilot sequence so that the BS can estimate the
corresponding right dominant channel singular vectors and the corresponding
eigenvalues. The low-complexity projection approximation subspace tracking with
deflation (PASTd) algorithm is used at the MSs for dominant subspace
estimation, while pilot-matched (PM) and zero-forcing (ZF) reception is used at
the BS. The proposed algorithms can be used in conjuction with an analog RF
beamformer and are shown to exhibit very good performance.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes the use of subspace tracking algorithms for performing
MIMO channel estimation at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. Using a
subspace approach, we develop a protocol enabling the estimation of the right
(resp. left) singular vectors at the transmitter (resp. receiver) side; then,
we adapt the projection approximation subspace tracking with deflation (PASTd)
and the orthogonal Oja (OOJA) algorithms to our framework and obtain two
channel estimation algorithms. The hybrid analog/digital nature of the
beamformer is also explicitly taken into account at the algorithm design stage.
Numerical results show that the proposed estimation algorithms are effective,
and that they perform better than two relevant competing alternatives available
in the open literature.

 <dc:description>  Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a variation of traditional supervised
learning problems where data (referred to as bags) are composed of sub-elements
(referred to as instances) and only bag labels are available. MIL has a variety
of applications such as content-based image retrieval, text categorization and
medical diagnosis. Most of the previous work for MIL assume that the training
bags are fully labeled. However, it is often difficult to obtain an enough
number of labeled bags in practical situations, while many unlabeled bags are
available. A learning framework called PU learning (positive and unlabeled
learning) can address this problem. In this paper, we propose a convex PU
learning method to solve an MIL problem. We experimentally show that the
proposed method achieves better performance with significantly lower
computational costs than an existing method for PU-MIL.

 <dc:title>Quantum algorithm for tree size estimation, with applications to

 <dc:description>  We study quantum algorithms on search trees of unknown structure, in a model
where the tree can be discovered by local exploration. That is, we are given
the root of the tree and access to a black box which, given a vertex $v$,
outputs the children of $v$.
  We construct a quantum algorithm which, given such access to a search tree of
depth at most $n$, estimates the size of the tree $T$ within a factor of $1\pm
\delta$ in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nT})$ steps. More generally, the same algorithm can
be used to estimate size of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in a similar model.
  We then show two applications of this result:
  a) We show how to transform a classical backtracking search algorithm which
examines $T$ nodes of a search tree into an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}n^{3/2})$ time
quantum algorithm, improving over an earlier quantum backtracking algorithm of
Montanaro (arXiv:1509.02374).
  b) We give a quantum algorithm for evaluating AND-OR formulas in a model
where the formula can be discovered by local exploration (modeling position
trees in 2-player games). We show that, in this setting, formulas of size $T$
and depth $T^{o(1)}$ can be evaluated in quantum time $O(T^{1/2+o(1)})$. Thus,
the quantum speedup is essentially the same as in the case when the formula is
known in advance.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a novel joint computation and communication cooperation
approach in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, which enables user cooperation
in both computation and communication for improving the MEC performance. In
particular, we consider a basic three-node MEC system that consists of a user
node, a helper node, and an access point (AP) node attached with an MEC server.
We focus on the user's latency-constrained computation over a finite block, and
develop a four-slot protocol for implementing the joint computation and
communication cooperation. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the
computation and communication resource allocation at both the user and the
helper, so as to minimize their total energy consumption subject to the user's
computation latency constraint. We provide the optimal solution to this
problem. Numerical results show that the proposed joint cooperation approach
significantly improves the computation capacity and the energy efficiency at
the user and helper nodes, as compared to other benchmark schemes without such
a joint design.

 <dc:creator>Moosavi, Nafise Sadat</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Lexical features are a major source of information in state-of-the-art
coreference resolvers. Lexical features implicitly model some of the linguistic
phenomena at a fine granularity level. They are especially useful for
representing the context of mentions. In this paper we investigate a drawback
of using many lexical features in state-of-the-art coreference resolvers. We
show that if coreference resolvers mainly rely on lexical features, they can
hardly generalize to unseen domains. Furthermore, we show that the current
coreference resolution evaluation is clearly flawed by only evaluating on a
specific split of a specific dataset in which there is a notable overlap
between the training, development and test sets.

 <dc:title>A general private information retrieval scheme for MDS coded databases

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of private information retrieval gets renewed attentions in
recent years due to its information-theoretic reformulation and applications in
distributed storage systems. PIR capacity is the maximal number of bits
privately retrieved per one bit of downloaded bit. The capacity has been fully
solved for some degenerating cases. For a general case where the database is
both coded and colluded, the exact capacity remains unknown. We build a general
private information retrieval scheme for MDS coded databases with colluding
servers. Our scheme achieves the rate $(1+R+R^2+\cdots+R^{M-1})$, where
$R=1-\frac{{{N-T}\choose K}}{{N\choose K}}$. Compared to existing PIR schemes,
our scheme performs better for a certain range of parameters and is suitable
for any underlying MDS code used in the distributed storage system.

 <dc:description>  We consider a cloud based multiserver system, that may be cloud based,
consisting of a set of replica application servers behind a set of proxy
(indirection) servers which interact directly with clients over the Internet.
We address cloud-side proactive and reactive defenses to combat DDoS attacks
that may target this system. DDoS attacks are endemic with some notable attacks
occurring just this past fall. Volumetric attacks may target proxies while &quot;low
volume&quot; attacks may target replicas. After reviewing existing and proposed
defenses, such as changing proxy IP addresses (a &quot;moving target&quot; technique to
combat the reconnaissance phase of the botnet) and fission of overloaded
servers, we focus on evaluation of defenses based on shuffling client-to-server
assignments that can be both proactive and reactive to a DDoS attack. Our
evaluations are based on a binomial distribution model that well agrees with
simulations and preliminary experiments on a prototype that is also described.

 <dc:description>  Public bike renting is more and more popular in cities to incentivise a
reduction in car journeys and to boost the use of green transportation
alternatives. One of the challenges of this application is to effectively plan
the resources usage. This paper presents some analysis of Dublin bike renting
scheme based on statistics and data mining. It provides available bike patterns
at the most interesting bike stations, that is, the busiest and the quietest
stations. Consistency checking with new data reinforces confidence in the
patterns obtained. Identifying available bike patterns helps to better address
user needs such as organising the rebalancing of the bike numbers between
stations in advance of demand.

 <dc:description>  Matrix completion models are among the most common formulations of
recommender systems. Recent works have showed a boost of performance of these
techniques when introducing the pairwise relationships between users/items in
the form of graphs, and imposing smoothness priors on these graphs. However,
such techniques do not fully exploit the local stationarity structures of
user/item graphs, and the number of parameters to learn is linear w.r.t. the
number of users and items. We propose a novel approach to overcome these
limitations by using geometric deep learning on graphs. Our matrix completion
architecture combines graph convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural
networks to learn meaningful statistical graph-structured patterns and the
non-linear diffusion process that generates the known ratings. This neural
network system requires a constant number of parameters independent of the
matrix size. We apply our method on both synthetic and real datasets, showing
that it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

 <dc:description>  We generalize the deterministic simulation theorem of Raz and McKenzie
[RM99], to any gadget which satisfies certain hitting property. We prove that
inner-product and gap-Hamming satisfy this property, and as a corollary we
obtain deterministic simulation theorem for these gadgets, where the gadget's
input-size is logarithmic in the input-size of the outer function. This answers
an open question posed by G\&quot;{o}\&quot;{o}s, Pitassi and Watson [GPW15]. Our result
also implies the previous results for the Indexing gadget, with better
parameters than was previously known. A preliminary version of the results
obtained in this work appeared in [CKL+17].

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a modular in-pipeline climbing robot with a novel
compliant foldable OmniCrawler mechanism. The circular cross-section of the
OmniCrawler module enables a holonomic motion to facilitate the alignment of
the robot in the direction of bends. Additionally, the crawler mechanism
provides a fair amount of traction, even on slippery surfaces. These advantages
of crawler modules have been further supplemented by incorporating active
compliance in the module itself which helps to negotiate sharp bends in small
diameter pipes. The robot has a series of 3 such compliant foldable modules
interconnected by the links via passive joints. For the desirable pipe diameter
and curvature of the bends, the spring stiffness value for each passive joint
is determined by formulating a constrained optimization problem using the
quasi-static model of the robot. Moreover, a minimum friction coefficient value
between the module-pipe surface which can be vertically climbed by the robot
without slipping is estimated. The numerical simulation results have further
been validated by experiments on real robot prototype.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the adaptive cuckoo filter (ACF), a data structure for
approximate set membership that extends cuckoo filters by reacting to false
positives, removing them for future queries. As an example application, in
packet processing queries may correspond to flow identifiers, so a search for
an element is likely to be followed by repeated searches for that element.
Removing false positives can therefore significantly lower the false positive
rate. The ACF, like the cuckoo filter, uses a cuckoo hash table to store
fingerprints. We allow fingerprint entries to be changed in response to a false
positive in a manner designed to minimize the effect on the performance of the
filter. We show that the ACF is able to significantly reduce the false positive
rate by presenting both a theoretical model for the false positive rate and
simulations using both synthetic data sets and real packet traces.

 <dc:description>  The technological advancement and sophistication in cameras and gadgets
prompt researchers to have focus on image analysis and text understanding. The
deep learning techniques demonstrated well to assess the potential for
classifying text from natural scene images as reported in recent years. There
are variety of deep learning approaches that prospects the detection and
recognition of text, effectively from images. In this work, we presented Arabic
scene text recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) as a deep
learning classifier. As the scene text data is slanted and skewed, thus to deal
with maximum variations, we employ five orientations with respect to single
occurrence of a character. The training is formulated by keeping filter size 3
x 3 and 5 x 5 with stride value as 1 and 2. During text classification phase,
we trained network with distinct learning rates. Our approach reported
encouraging results on recognition of Arabic characters from segmented Arabic
scene images.

 <dc:description>  The dispersion problem has been widely studied in computational geometry and
facility location, and is closely related to the packing problem. The goal is
to locate n points (e.g., facilities or persons) in a k-dimensional polytope,
so that they are far away from each other and from the boundary of the
polytope. In many real-world scenarios however, the points arrive and depart at
different times, and decisions must be made without knowing future events.
Therefore we study, for the first time in the literature, the online dispersion
problem in Euclidean space.
  There are two natural objectives when time is involved: the all-time
worst-case (ATWC) problem tries to maximize the minimum distance that ever
appears at any time; and the cumulative distance (CD) problem tries to maximize
the integral of the minimum distance throughout the whole time interval.
Interestingly, the online problems are highly non-trivial even on a segment.
For cumulative distance, this remains the case even when the problem is
time-dependent but offline, with all the arriving and departure times given in
advance.
  For the online ATWC problem on a segment, we construct a deterministic
polynomial-time algorithm which is (2ln2+epsilon)-competitive, where epsilon&gt;0
can be arbitrarily small and the algorithm's running time is polynomial in
1/epsilon. We show this algorithm is actually optimal. For the same problem in
a square, we provide a 1.591-competitive algorithm and a 1.183 lower-bound.
Furthermore, for arbitrary k-dimensional polytopes with k&gt;=2, we provide a
2/(1-epsilon)-competitive algorithm and a 7/6 lower-bound. Interestingly, for
the offline CD problem in arbitrary k-dimensional polytopes, we provide a
polynomial-time black-box reduction to the online ATWC problem, and the
resulting competitive ratio increases by a factor of at most 2.

 <dc:description>  Healthcare sector is totally different from other industry. It is on high
priority sector and people expect highest level of care and services regardless
of cost. It did not achieve social expectation even though it consume huge
percentage of budget. Mostly the interpretations of medical data is being done
by medical expert. In terms of image interpretation by human expert, it is
quite limited due to its subjectivity, the complexity of the image, extensive
variations exist across different interpreters, and fatigue. After the success
of deep learning in other real world application, it is also providing exciting
solutions with good accuracy for medical imaging and is seen as a key method
for future applications in health secotr. In this chapter, we discussed state
of the art deep learning architecture and its optimization used for medical
image segmentation and classification. In the last section, we have discussed
the challenges deep learning based methods for medical imaging and open

 <dc:description>  Recent initiatives by regulatory agencies to increase spectrum resources
available for broadband access include rules for sharing spectrum with
high-priority incumbents. We study a model in which wireless Service Providers
(SPs) charge for access to their own exclusive-use (licensed) band along with
access to an additional shared band. The total, or delivered price in each band
is the announced price plus a congestion cost, which depends on the load, or
total users normalized by the bandwidth. The shared band is intermittently
available with some probability, due to incumbent activity, and when
unavailable, any traffic carried on that band must be shifted to licensed
bands. The SPs then compete for quantity of users. We show that the value of
the shared band depends on the relative sizes of the SPs: large SPs with more
bandwidth are better able to absorb the variability caused by intermittency
than smaller SPs. However, as the amount of shared spectrum increases, the
large SPs may not make use of it. In that scenario shared spectrum creates more
value than splitting it among the SPs for exclusive use. We also show that
fixing the average amount of available shared bandwidth, increasing the
reliability of the band is preferable to increasing the bandwidth.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we present a novel approach for block-structured adaptive
mesh refinement (AMR) that is suitable for extreme-scale parallelism. All data
structures are designed such that the size of the meta data in each distributed
processor memory remains bounded independent of the processor number. In all
stages of the AMR process, we use only distributed algorithms. No central
resources such as a master process or replicated data are employed, so that an
unlimited scalability can be achieved. For the dynamic load balancing in
particular, we propose to exploit the hierarchical nature of the
block-structured domain partitioning by creating a lightweight, temporary copy
of the core data structure. This copy acts as a local and fully distributed
proxy data structure. It does not contain simulation data, but only provides
topological information about the domain partitioning into blocks. Ultimately,
this approach enables an inexpensive, local, diffusion-based dynamic load
balancing scheme.
  We demonstrate the excellent performance and the full scalability of our new
AMR implementation for two architecturally different petascale supercomputers.
Benchmarks on an IBM Blue Gene/Q system with a mesh containing 3.7 trillion
unknowns distributed to 458,752 processes confirm the applicability for future
extreme-scale parallel machines. The algorithms proposed in this article
operate on blocks that result from the domain partitioning. This concept and
its realization support the storage of arbitrary data. In consequence, the
software framework can be used for different simulation methods, including mesh
based and meshless methods. In this article, we demonstrate fluid simulations
based on the lattice Boltzmann method.

 <dc:description>  Species tree reconstruction from genomic data is increasingly performed using
methods that account for sources of gene tree discordance such as incomplete
lineage sorting. One popular method for reconstructing species trees from
unrooted gene tree topologies is ASTRAL. In this paper, we derive theoretical
sample complexity results for the number of genes required by ASTRAL to
guarantee reconstruction of the correct species tree with high probability. We
also validate those theoretical bounds in a simulation study. Our results
indicate that ASTRAL requires $\mathcal{O}(f^{-2} \log n)$ gene trees to
reconstruct the species tree correctly with high probability where n is the
number of species and f is the length of the shortest branch in the species
tree. Our simulations, which are the first to test ASTRAL explicitly under the
anomaly zone, show trends consistent with the theoretical bounds and also
provide some practical insights on the conditions where ASTRAL works well.

 <dc:description>  We study Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods operating in primary sample
space and their interactions with multiple sampling techniques. We observe that
incorporating the sampling technique into the state of the Markov Chain, as
done in Multiplexed Metropolis Light Transport (MMLT), impedes the ability of
the chain to properly explore the path space, as transitions between sampling
techniques lead to disruptive alterations of path samples. To address this
issue, we reformulate Multiplexed MLT in the Reversible Jump MCMC framework
(RJMCMC) and introduce inverse sampling techniques that turn light paths into
the random numbers that would produce them. This allows us to formulate a novel
perturbation that can locally transition between sampling techniques without
changing the geometry of the path, and we derive the correct acceptance
probability using RJMCMC. We investigate how to generalize this concept to
non-invertible sampling techniques commonly found in practice, and introduce
probabilistic inverses that extend our perturbation to cover most sampling
methods found in light transport simulations. Our theory reconciles the
inverses with RJMCMC yielding an unbiased algorithm, which we call Reversible
Jump MLT (RJMLT). We verify the correctness of our implementation in canonical
and practical scenarios and demonstrate improved temporal coherence, decrease
in structured artifacts, and faster convergence on a wide variety of scenes.

 <dc:description>  Sarcasm is a form of speech in which speakers say the opposite of what they
truly mean in order to convey a strong sentiment. In other words, &quot;Sarcasm is
the giant chasm between what I say, and the person who doesn't get it.&quot;. In
this paper we present the novel task of sarcasm interpretation, defined as the
generation of a non-sarcastic utterance conveying the same message as the
original sarcastic one. We introduce a novel dataset of 3000 sarcastic tweets,
each interpreted by five human judges. Addressing the task as monolingual
machine translation (MT), we experiment with MT algorithms and evaluation
measures. We then present SIGN: an MT based sarcasm interpretation algorithm
that targets sentiment words, a defining element of textual sarcasm. We show
that while the scores of n-gram based automatic measures are similar for all
interpretation models, SIGN's interpretations are scored higher by humans for
adequacy and sentiment polarity. We conclude with a discussion on future
research directions for our new task.

many-to-many problem in which a rider can travel by transferring between
multiple drivers, and a driver can carry multiple riders. We propose a

decomposition algorithm to solve the original ride-matching problem to
optimality by means of solving multiple smaller problems. We conduct extensive
numerical experiments to demonstrate the computational efficiency of the
proposed algorithm and show its practical applicability to reasonably-sized
dynamic ride-matching contexts. Finally, in the interest of even lower solution
times, we propose heuristic solution methods, and investigate the trade-offs
between solution time and accuracy.

 <dc:description>  The problem of ranking a set of items is a fundamental algorithmic task in
today's data-driven world. Ranking algorithms lie at the core of applications
such as search engines, news feeds, and recommendation systems. However, recent
events and studies show that bias exists in the output of such applications.
This results in unfairness or decreased diversity in the presentation of the
content and can exacerbate stereotypes and manipulate perceptions. Motivated by
these concerns, in this paper we introduce a framework for incorporating
fairness in ranking problems. In our model, we are given a collection of items
along with 1) the value of placing an item at a particular position, 2) the
collection of possibly non-disjoint attributes (e.g., gender and ethnicity or
genre and price point depending on the context) of each item and 3) a
collection of fairness constraints that bound the number of items with each
attribute that are allowed to appear in the top positions of the ranking. The
goal is to output a ranking that maximizes value while respecting the fairness
constraints. We present algorithms along with complementary hardness results
which, together, come close to settling the complexity of this constrained
ranking maximization problem.

 <dc:description>  We present new methods for simultaneously estimating camera geometry and time
shift from video sequences from multiple unsynchronized cameras. Algorithms for
simultaneous computation of a fundamental matrix or a homography with unknown
time shift between images are developed. Our methods use minimal correspondence
sets (eight for fundamental matrix and four and a half for homography) and
therefore are suitable for robust estimation using RANSAC. Furthermore, we
present an iterative algorithm that extends the applicability on sequences
which are significantly unsynchronized, finding the correct time shift up to
several seconds. We evaluated the methods on synthetic and wide range of real
world datasets and the results show a broad applicability to the problem of
camera synchronization.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the Robust Multiperiod Network Design Problem, a
generalization of the classical Capacitated Network Design Problem that
additionally considers multiple design periods and provides solutions protected
against traffic uncertainty. Given the intrinsic difficulty of the problem,
which proves challenging even for state-of-the art commercial solvers, we
propose a hybrid primal heuristic based on the combination of ant colony
optimization and an exact large neighborhood search. Computational experiments
on a set of realistic instances from the SNDlib show that our heuristic can
find solutions of extremely good quality with low optimality gap.

 <dc:description>  Classical distribution testing assumes access to i.i.d. samples from the
distribution that is being tested. We initiate the study of Markov chain
testing, assuming access to a single trajectory of a Markov Chain. In
particular, we observe a single trajectory X0,...,Xt,... of an unknown,
symmetric, and finite state Markov Chain M. We do not control the starting
state X0, and we cannot restart the chain. Given our single trajectory, the
goal is to test whether M is identical to a model Markov Chain M0 , or far from
it under an appropriate notion of difference. We propose a measure of
difference between two Markov chains, motivated by the early work of Kazakos
[Kaz78], which captures the scaling behavior of the total variation distance
between trajectories sampled from the Markov chains as the length of these
trajectories grows. We provide efficient testers and information-theoretic
lower bounds for testing identity of symmetric Markov chains under our proposed
measure of difference, which are tight up to logarithmic factors if the hitting
times of the model chain M0 is O(n) in the size of the state space n.

 <dc:description>  Human verbal communication includes affective messages which are conveyed
through use of emotionally colored words. There has been a lot of research in
this direction but the problem of integrating state-of-the-art neural language
models with affective information remains an area ripe for exploration. In this
paper, we propose an extension to an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) language
model for generating conversational text, conditioned on affect categories. Our
proposed model, Affect-LM enables us to customize the degree of emotional
content in generated sentences through an additional design parameter.
Perception studies conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk show that Affect-LM
generates naturally looking emotional sentences without sacrificing grammatical
correctness. Affect-LM also learns affect-discriminative word representations,
and perplexity experiments show that additional affective information in
conversational text can improve language model prediction.

 <dc:description>  Sleep condition is closely related to an individual's health. Poor sleep
conditions such as sleep disorder and sleep deprivation affect one's daily
performance, and may also cause many chronic diseases. Many efforts have been
devoted to monitoring people's sleep conditions. However, traditional
methodologies require sophisticated equipment and consume a significant amount
of time. In this paper, we attempt to develop a novel way to predict
individual's sleep condition via scrutinizing facial cues as doctors would.
Rather than measuring the sleep condition directly, we measure the
sleep-deprived fatigue which indirectly reflects the sleep condition. Our
method can predict a sleep-deprived fatigue rate based on a selfie provided by
a subject. This rate is used to indicate the sleep condition. To gain deeper
insights of human sleep conditions, we collected around 100,000 faces from
selfies posted on Twitter and Instagram, and identified their age, gender, and
race using automatic algorithms. Next, we investigated the sleep condition
distributions with respect to age, gender, and race. Our study suggests among
the age groups, fatigue percentage of the 0-20 youth and adolescent group is
the highest, implying that poor sleep condition is more prevalent in this age
group. For gender, the fatigue percentage of females is higher than that of
males, implying that more females are suffering from sleep issues than males.
Among ethnic groups, the fatigue percentage in Caucasian is the highest
followed by Asian and African American.

 <dc:description>  We present a deep neural architecture that parses sentences into three
semantic dependency graph formalisms. By using efficient, nearly arc-factored
inference and a bidirectional-LSTM composed with a multi-layer perceptron, our
base system is able to significantly improve the state of the art for semantic
dependency parsing, without using hand-engineered features or syntax. We then
explore two multitask learning approaches---one that shares parameters across
formalisms, and one that uses higher-order structures to predict the graphs
jointly. We find that both approaches improve performance across formalisms on
average, achieving a new state of the art. Our code is open-source and
available at https://github.com/Noahs-ARK/NeurboParser.

 <dc:description>  Image semantic segmentation is more and more being of interest for computer
vision and machine learning researchers. Many applications on the rise need
accurate and efficient segmentation mechanisms: autonomous driving, indoor
navigation, and even virtual or augmented reality systems to name a few. This
demand coincides with the rise of deep learning approaches in almost every
field or application target related to computer vision, including semantic
segmentation or scene understanding. This paper provides a review on deep
learning methods for semantic segmentation applied to various application
areas. Firstly, we describe the terminology of this field as well as mandatory
background concepts. Next, the main datasets and challenges are exposed to help
researchers decide which are the ones that best suit their needs and their
targets. Then, existing methods are reviewed, highlighting their contributions
and their significance in the field. Finally, quantitative results are given
for the described methods and the datasets in which they were evaluated,
following up with a discussion of the results. At last, we point out a set of
promising future works and draw our own conclusions about the state of the art
of semantic segmentation using deep learning techniques.

 <dc:description>  Spatial crowdsourcing (SC) is a new platform that engages individuals in
collecting and analyzing environmental, social and other spatiotemporal
information. With SC, requesters outsource their spatiotemporal tasks to a set
of workers, who will perform the tasks by physically traveling to the tasks'
locations. This chapter identifies privacy threats toward both workers and
requesters during the two main phases of spatial crowdsourcing, tasking and
reporting. Tasking is the process of identifying which tasks should be assigned
to which workers. This process is handled by a spatial crowdsourcing server
(SC-server). The latter phase is reporting, in which workers travel to the
tasks' locations, complete the tasks and upload their reports to the SC-server.
The challenge is to enable effective and efficient tasking as well as reporting
in SC without disclosing the actual locations of workers (at least until they
agree to perform a task) and the tasks themselves (at least to workers who are
not assigned to those tasks). This chapter aims to provide an overview of the
state-of-the-art in protecting users' location privacy in spatial
crowdsourcing. We provide a comparative study of a diverse set of solutions in
terms of task publishing modes (push vs. pull), problem focuses (tasking and
reporting), threats (server, requester and worker), and underlying technical
approaches (from pseudonymity, cloaking, and perturbation to exchange-based and
encryption-based techniques). The strengths and drawbacks of the techniques are
highlighted, leading to a discussion of open problems and future work.

functions (VNFs) into a forwarding graph (FG) at the logical layer and the

less-than-carrier-grade reliability of COTS components. This work investigates
the trade-off between end-to-end reliability and computational load per server
via the joint design of VNF chain composition (CC) and FG embedding (FGE) under
the assumption of a bipartite FG that consists of controller and regular VNFs.
Evaluating the reliability criterion within a probabilistic model, analytical
insights are first provided for a simplified disconnected FG. Then, a block
coordinate descent method based on mixed-integer linear programming is proposed
to tackle the joint optimization of CC and FGE. Via simulation results, it is
observed that a joint design of CC and FGE leads to substantial performance
gains compared to separate optimization approaches.

 <dc:description>  Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is a novel platform that engages individuals in
the act of collecting various types of spatial data. This method of data
collection can significantly reduce cost and turnover time, and is particularly
useful in urban environmental sensing, where traditional means fail to provide
fine-grained field data. In this study, we introduce hyperlocal spatial
crowdsourcing, where all workers who are located within the spatiotemporal
vicinity of a task are eligible to perform the task, e.g., reporting the
precipitation level at their area and time. In this setting, there is often a
budget constraint, either for every time period or for the entire campaign, on
the number of workers to activate to perform tasks. The challenge is thus to
maximize the number of assigned tasks under the budget constraint, despite the
dynamic arrivals of workers and tasks. We introduce a taxonomy of several
problem variants, such as budget-per-time-period vs. budget-per-campaign and
binary-utility vs. distance-based-utility. We study the hardness of the task
assignment problem in the offline setting and propose online heuristics which
exploits the spatial and temporal knowledge acquired over time. Our experiments
are conducted with spatial crowdsourcing workloads generated by the SCAWG tool
and extensive results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
solutions.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel factor graph model for argument mining, designed for
settings in which the argumentative relations in a document do not necessarily
form a tree structure. (This is the case in over 20% of the web comments
dataset we release.) Our model jointly learns elementary unit type
classification and argumentative relation prediction. Moreover, our model
supports SVM and RNN parametrizations, can enforce structure constraints (e.g.,
transitivity), and can express dependencies between adjacent relations and
propositions. Our approaches outperform unstructured baselines in both web
comments and argumentative essay datasets.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problems for covering multiple intervals on a
line. Given a set B of m line segments (called &quot;barriers&quot;) on a horizontal line
L and another set S of n horizontal line segments of the same length in the
plane, we want to move all segments of S to L so that their union covers all
barriers and the maximum movement of all segments of S is minimized.
Previously, an O(n^3 log n)-time algorithm was given for the problem but only
for the special case m = 1. In this paper, we propose an O(n^2 log n log log n
+ nm log m)-time algorithm for any m, which improves the previous work even for
m = 1. We then consider a line-constrained version of the problem in which the
segments of S are all initially on the line L. Previously, an O(n log n)-time
algorithm was known for the case m = 1. We present an algorithm of O((n + m)
log(n + m)) time for any m. These problems may have applications in mobile
sensor barrier coverage in wireless sensor networks.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A conformal flattening maps a curved surface to the plane without distorting
angles---such maps have become a fundamental building block for problems in
geometry processing, numerical simulation, and computational design. Yet
existing methods provide little direct control over the shape of the flattened
domain, or else demand expensive nonlinear optimization. Boundary first
flattening (BFF) is a linear method for conformal parameterization which is
faster than traditional linear methods, yet provides control and quality
comparable to sophisticated nonlinear schemes. The key insight is that the
boundary data for many conformal mapping problems can be efficiently
constructed via the Cherrier formula together with a pair of Poincare-Steklov
operators; once the boundary is known, the map can be easily extended over the
rest of the domain. Since computation demands only a single factorization of
the real Laplace matrix, the amortized cost is about 50x less than any
previously published technique for boundary-controlled conformal flattening. As
a result, BFF opens the door to real-time editing or fast optimization of
high-resolution maps, with direct control over boundary length or angle. We
show how this method can be used to construct maps with sharp corners, cone
singularities, minimal area distortion, and uniformization over the unit disk;
we also demonstrate for the first time how a surface can be conformally
flattened directly onto any given target shape.

 <dc:description>  Wireless communications literature is very rich with empirical studies and
measurement campaigns that study the nature of the wireless propagation
channel. However, despite their undoubted usefulness, many of these studies
have omitted a fundamental yet key feature of the physical signal propagation,
that is, wireless propagation asymmetry. This feature does not agree with the
electromagnetic reciprocity theorem, and the many research papers that adopt
wireless channel symmetry, and hence rendering their modeling, unexpectedly,
inaccurate. Besides, asymmetry is unquestionably an important characteristic of
wireless channels, which needs to be accurately characterized for
vehicular/mobile communications, 5G networks, and associated applications such
as indoor/outdoor localization. This paper presents a modest and a preliminary
study that reports potential causes of propagation asymmetry. Measurements
conducted on Khalifa University campus in UAE show that wireless channels are
symmetric in the absence of symmetry impairments. Therefore, care should be
taken when considering some practical wireless propagation scenarios. Key
conclusions and recommendation are summarized. We believe that this study will
be inspiring for the academic community and will trigger further investigations
within wireless propagation assumptions.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent Neural Networks are showing much promise in many sub-areas of
natural language processing, ranging from document classification to machine
translation to automatic question answering. Despite their promise, many
recurrent models have to read the whole text word by word, making it slow to
handle long documents. For example, it is difficult to use a recurrent network
to read a book and answer questions about it. In this paper, we present an
approach of reading text while skipping irrelevant information if needed. The
underlying model is a recurrent network that learns how far to jump after
reading a few words of the input text. We employ a standard policy gradient
method to train the model to make discrete jumping decisions. In our benchmarks
on four different tasks, including number prediction, sentiment analysis, news
article classification and automatic Q\&amp;A, our proposed model, a modified LSTM
with jumping, is up to 6 times faster than the standard sequential LSTM, while
maintaining the same or even better accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Keyphrase provides highly-summative information that can be effectively used
for understanding, organizing and retrieving text content. Though previous
studies have provided many workable solutions for automated keyphrase
extraction, they commonly divided the to-be-summarized content into multiple
text chunks, then ranked and selected the most meaningful ones. These
approaches could neither identify keyphrases that do not appear in the text,
nor capture the real semantic meaning behind the text. We propose a generative
model for keyphrase prediction with an encoder-decoder framework, which can
effectively overcome the above drawbacks. We name it as deep keyphrase
generation since it attempts to capture the deep semantic meaning of the
content with a deep learning method. Empirical analysis on six datasets
demonstrates that our proposed model not only achieves a significant
performance boost on extracting keyphrases that appear in the source text, but
also can generate absent keyphrases based on the semantic meaning of the text.
Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/memray/seq2seq-keyphrase.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of online learning in misspecified linear stochastic
multi-armed bandit problems. Regret guarantees for state-of-the-art linear
bandit algorithms such as Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty Linear bandit
(OFUL) hold under the assumption that the arms expected rewards are perfectly
linear in their features. It is, however, of interest to investigate the impact
of potential misspecification in linear bandit models, where the expected
rewards are perturbed away from the linear subspace determined by the arms
features. Although OFUL has recently been shown to be robust to relatively
small deviations from linearity, we show that any linear bandit algorithm that
enjoys optimal regret performance in the perfectly linear setting (e.g., OFUL)
must suffer linear regret under a sparse additive perturbation of the linear
model. In an attempt to overcome this negative result, we define a natural
class of bandit models characterized by a non-sparse deviation from linearity.
We argue that the OFUL algorithm can fail to achieve sublinear regret even
under models that have non-sparse deviation.We finally develop a novel bandit
algorithm, comprising a hypothesis test for linearity followed by a decision to
use either the OFUL or Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. For perfectly
linear bandit models, the algorithm provably exhibits OFULs favorable regret
performance, while for misspecified models satisfying the non-sparse deviation
property, the algorithm avoids the linear regret phenomenon and falls back on
UCBs sublinear regret scaling. Numerical experiments on synthetic data, and on
recommendation data from the public Yahoo! Learning to Rank Challenge dataset,
empirically support our findings.

 <dc:description>  Though the deep learning is pushing the machine learning to a new stage,
basic theories of machine learning are still limited. The principle of
learning, the role of the a prior knowledge, the role of neuron bias, and the
basis for choosing neural transfer function and cost function, etc., are still
far from clear. In this paper, we present a general theoretical framework for
machine learning. We classify the prior knowledge into common and
problem-dependent parts, and consider that the aim of learning is to maximally
incorporate them. The principle we suggested for maximizing the former is the
design risk minimization principle, while the neural transfer function, the
cost function, as well as pretreatment of samples, are endowed with the role
for maximizing the latter. The role of the neuron bias is explained from a
different angle. We develop a Monte Carlo algorithm to establish the
input-output responses, and we control the input-output sensitivity of a
learning machine by controlling that of individual neurons. Applications of
function approaching and smoothing, pattern recognition and classification, are
provided to illustrate how to train general learning machines based on our
theory and algorithm. Our method may in addition induce new applications, such
as the transductive inference.

 <dc:description>  We propose a self-supervised approach for learning representations and
robotic behaviors entirely from unlabeled videos recorded from multiple
viewpoints, and study how this representation can be used in two robotic
imitation settings: imitating object interactions from videos of humans, and
imitating human poses. Imitation of human behavior requires a
viewpoint-invariant representation that captures the relationships between
end-effectors (hands or robot grippers) and the environment, object attributes,
and body pose. We train our representations using a triplet loss, where
multiple simultaneous viewpoints of the same observation are attracted in the
embedding space, while being repelled from temporal neighbors which are often
visually similar but functionally different. This signal causes our model to
discover attributes that do not change across viewpoint, but do change across
time, while ignoring nuisance variables such as occlusions, motion blur,
lighting and background. We demonstrate that this representation can be used by
a robot to directly mimic human poses without an explicit correspondence, and
that it can be used as a reward function within a reinforcement learning
algorithm. While representations are learned from an unlabeled collection of
task-related videos, robot behaviors such as pouring are learned by watching a
single 3rd-person demonstration by a human. Reward functions obtained by
following the human demonstrations under the learned representation enable
efficient reinforcement learning that is practical for real-world robotic
systems. Video results, open-source code and dataset are available at

 <dc:description>  Recently vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication emerged as a key enabling
technology to ensure traffic safety and other mission-critical applications. In
this paper, a novel proximity and quality-of-service (QoS)-aware resource
allocation for V2V communication is proposed. The proposed approach exploits
the spatial-temporal aspects of vehicles in terms of their physical proximity
and traffic demands, to minimize the total transmission power while considering
queuing latency and reliability. Due to the overhead caused by frequent
information exchange between vehicles and the roadside unit (RSU), the
centralized problem is decoupled into two interrelated subproblems. First, a
novel RSU-assisted virtual clustering mechanism is proposed to group vehicles
in zones based on their physical proximity. Given the vehicles' traffic demands
and their QoS requirements, resource blocks are assigned to each zone. Second,
leveraging techniques from Lyapunov stochastic optimization, a power
minimization solution is proposed for each V2V pair within each zone.
Simulation results for a Manhattan model have shown that the proposed scheme
outperforms the baseline in terms of average queuing latency reduction up to
97% and significant improvement in reliability.

 <dc:description>  A recently proposed exact algorithm for the maximum independent set problem
is analyzed. The typical running time is improved exponentially in some
parameter regions compared to simple binary search. The algorithm also
overcomes the core transition point, where the conventional leaf removal
algorithm fails, and works up to the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) transition
point. This suggests that a leaf removal core itself is not enough for typical
hardness in the random maximum independent set problem, providing further
evidence for RSB being the obstacle for algorithms in general.

 <dc:description>  Investigation of social influence dynamics requires mathematical models that
are &quot;simple&quot; enough to admit rigorous analysis, and yet sufficiently &quot;rich&quot; to
capture salient features of social groups. Thus, the mechanism of iterative
opinion pooling from (DeGroot, 1974), which can explain the generation of
consensus, was elaborated in (Friedkin and Johnsen, 1999) to take into account
individuals' ongoing attachments to their initial opinions, or prejudices. The
&quot;anchorage&quot; of individuals to their prejudices may disable reaching consensus
and cause disagreement in a social influence network. Further elaboration of
this model may be achieved by relaxing its restrictive assumption of a
time-invariant influence network. During opinion dynamics on an issue, arcs of
interpersonal influence may be added or subtracted from the network, and the
influence weights assigned by an individual to his/her neighbors may alter. In
this paper, we establish new important properties of the (Friedkin and Johnsen,
1999) opinion formation model, and also examine its extension to time-varying
social influence networks.

 <dc:title>On Budget-Feasible Mechanism Design for Symmetric Submodular Objectives</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We study a class of procurement auctions with a budget constraint, where an
auctioneer is interested in buying resources or services from a set of agents.
Ideally, the auctioneer would like to select a subset of the resources so as to
maximize his valuation function, without exceeding a given budget. As the
resources are owned by strategic agents however, our overall goal is to design
mechanisms that are truthful, budget-feasible, and obtain a good approximation
to the optimal value. Budget-feasibility creates additional challenges, making
several approaches inapplicable in this setting. Previous results on
budget-feasible mechanisms have considered mostly monotone valuation functions.
In this work, we mainly focus on symmetric submodular valuations, a prominent
class of non-monotone submodular functions that includes cut functions. We
begin first with a purely algorithmic result, obtaining a
$\frac{2e}{e-1}$-approximation for maximizing symmetric submodular functions
under a budget constraint. We view this as a standalone result of independent
interest, as it is the best known factor achieved by a deterministic algorithm.
We then proceed to propose truthful, budget feasible mechanisms (both
deterministic and randomized), paying particular attention on the Budgeted Max
Cut problem. Our results significantly improve the known approximation ratios
for these objectives, while establishing polynomial running time for cases
where only exponential mechanisms were known. At the heart of our approach lies
an appropriate combination of local search algorithms with results for monotone
submodular valuations, applied to the derived local optima.

 <dc:description>  There has been a growing body of study on the relationship between
public/political discourse and its moral-emotional foundations. Most of the
studies, however, have been confined to a single country's context, lacking
cross-cultural perspectives. Taking a comparative perspective, we examined the
emotional and moral structures of political and public discussion observed in
the U.S. and Japan by employing extensive text data that cover these two
countries. Specifically, we conducted dictionary-based sentiment and moral
analyses of floor debate in the U.S. Congress and the Japanese Diet over a long
period of time. The analyses revealed intriguing cross-national patterns in the
moral-emotional framework employed in parliamentary deliberations, which cast
doubt on some of the dominant arguments in the field, including, among others,
J. Haidt's moral foundation hypothesis.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose &quot;Residual Attention Network&quot;, a convolutional neural
network using attention mechanism which can incorporate with state-of-art feed
forward network architecture in an end-to-end training fashion. Our Residual
Attention Network is built by stacking Attention Modules which generate
attention-aware features. The attention-aware features from different modules
change adaptively as layers going deeper. Inside each Attention Module,
bottom-up top-down feedforward structure is used to unfold the feedforward and
feedback attention process into a single feedforward process. Importantly, we
propose attention residual learning to train very deep Residual Attention
Networks which can be easily scaled up to hundreds of layers. Extensive
analyses are conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets to verify the
effectiveness of every module mentioned above. Our Residual Attention Network
achieves state-of-the-art object recognition performance on three benchmark
datasets including CIFAR-10 (3.90% error), CIFAR-100 (20.45% error) and
ImageNet (4.8% single model and single crop, top-5 error). Note that, our
method achieves 0.6% top-1 accuracy improvement with 46% trunk depth and 69%
forward FLOPs comparing to ResNet-200. The experiment also demonstrates that
our network is robust against noisy labels.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Submodular Influence Maximization with Myopic Feedback</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the problem of adaptive influence maximization in
social networks. It has been proved that if the problem satisfies the adaptive
submodularity property, then an adaptive greedy policy is guaranteed to provide
an (1 - 1/e)-approximation of the optimal policy. Nevertheless, so far such a
property has only been verified in the case of the full-adoption feedback
model. As adaptive decision making is time-critical, we consider a more
realistic feedback model, called myopic. In this direction, we introduce an
alternative utility function proving that it is adaptive monotonic and adaptive
submodular. It allows us to demonstrate that our myopic adaptive greedy policy
provides theoretical guarantees as it retains the (1 - 1/e)-approximation
ratio. Furthermore, we show that the adaptive submodularity property does not
hold if we allow the nodes to be deactivated randomly over time. Empirical
analysis on real-world networks reveals the benefits of the myopic adaptive
greedy strategy to the influence maximization problem.

 <dc:description>  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, with a designated
set of $\sigma$ sources $S\subseteq V$. The fault tolerant subgraph for any
graph problem maintains a sparse subgraph $H$ of $G$, such that for any set $F$
of $k$ failures, the solution for the graph problem on $G\setminus F$ is
maintained in $H\setminus F$. We address the problem of maintaining a fault
tolerant subgraph for Breath First Search tree (BFS) of the graph from a single
source $s\in V$ (referred as $k$ FT-BFS) or multiple sources $S\subseteq V$
(referred as $k$ FT-MBFS).
  The problem of $k$ FT-BFS was first studied by Parter and Peleg [ESA13]. They
designed an algorithm to compute FT-BFS subgraph of size $O(n^{3/2})$. Further,
they showed how their algorithm can be easily extended to FT-MBFS requiring
$O(\sigma^{1/2}n^{3/2})$ space. They also presented matching lower bounds for
these results. The result was later extended to solve dual FT-BFS by Parter
[PODC15] requiring $O(n^{5/3})$ space, again with matching lower bounds.
However, their result was limited to only edge failures in undirected graphs
and involved very complex analysis. Moreover, their solution doesn't seems to
be directly extendible for dual FT-MBFS problem.
  We present a similar algorithm to solve dual FT-BFS problem with a much
simpler analysis. Moreover, our algorithm also works for vertex failures and
directed graphs, and can be easily extended to handle dual FT-MBFS problem,
matching the lower bound of $O(\sigma^{1/3}n^{5/3})$ space described by Parter
[PODC15].The key difference in our approach is a much simpler classification of
path interactions which formed the basis of the analysis by Parter [PODC15].
Our dual FT-MBFS structure also seamlessly gives a dual fault tolerant spanner
with additive stretch of +2 having size $O(n^{7/8})$.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the discount pricing in word-of-mouth (WOM) marketing. A
new discount strategy known as the Infection-Based Discount (IBD) strategy is
proposed. The basic idea of the IBD strategy lies in that each customer enjoys
a discount that is linearly proportional to his/her influence in the WOM
network. To evaluate the performance of the IBD strategy, the WOM spreading
process is modeled as a dynamic model known as the DPA model, and the
performance of the IBD strategy is modeled as a function of the basic discount.
Next, the influence of different factors, including the basic discount and the
WOM network, on the dynamics of the DPA model is revealed experimentally.
Finally, the influence of different factors on the performance of the IBD
strategy is uncovered experimentally. On this basis, some promotional measures
are recommended.

 <dc:description>  Recent works have explored deep architectures for learning multimodal speech
representation (e.g. audio and images, articulation and audio) in a supervised
way. Here we investigate the role of combining different speech modalities,
i.e. audio and visual information representing the lips movements, in a weakly
supervised way using Siamese networks and lexical same-different side
information. In particular, we ask whether one modality can benefit from the
other to provide a richer representation for phone recognition in a weakly
supervised setting. We introduce mono-task and multi-task methods for merging
speech and visual modalities for phone recognition. The mono-task learning
consists in applying a Siamese network on the concatenation of the two
modalities, while the multi-task learning receives several different
combinations of modalities at train time. We show that multi-task learning
enhances discriminability for visual and multimodal inputs while minimally
impacting auditory inputs. Furthermore, we present a qualitative analysis of
the obtained phone embeddings, and show that cross-modal visual input can
improve the discriminability of phonological features which are visually
discernable (rounding, open/close, labial place of articulation), resulting in
representations that are closer to abstract linguistic features than those
based on audio only.

 <dc:title>Identify Critical Branches with Cascading Failure Chain Statistics and

 <dc:creator>Luo, Chao</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Yang, Jun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An effective way to suppress the cascading failure risk is the branch
capacity upgrade, whose optimal decision making, however, may incur high
computational burden. A practical way is to find out some critical branches as
the candidates in advance. This paper proposes a simulation data oriented
approach to identify the critical branches with higher importance in cascading
failure propagation. First, a concept of cascading failure chain (CFC) is
introduced and numerous samples of CFC are generated with an AC power flow
based cascading failure simulator. Then, a directed weighted graph is
constructed, whose edges denotes the severities of branch interactions. Third,
the weighted hypertext-induced topic search (HITS) algorithm is used to rate
and rank this graph's vertices,through which the critical branches can be
identified accordingly. Validations on IEEE 118bus and RTS96 systems show that
the proposed approach can identify critical branches whose capacity upgrades
suppress cascading failure risk more greatly. Moreover, it is also shown that
structural importance of a branch does not agree with its importance in
cascading failure, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed approach
compared with structure vulnerabilities based identifying methods.

output layer to be logarithmic in vocabulary size in the best case. In
addition, we also introduce two advanced approaches to improve the robustness
of the proposed model: using error-correcting codes and combining softmax and
binary codes. Experiments on two English-Japanese bidirectional translation
tasks show proposed models achieve BLEU scores that approach the softmax, while
reducing memory usage to the order of less than 1/10 and improving decoding
speed on CPUs by x5 to x10.

for $q\in (0,1)$. It is shown that the algorithm using an $p$-th order Taylor
model for $p$ odd needs in general at most $O(\epsilon^{-(p+1)/p})$ evaluations
of the objective function and its derivatives (at points where they are
defined) to produce an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order critical point. This
result is obtained either with Taylor models at the price of requiring the
feasible set to be 'kernel-centered' (which includes bound constraints and many
other cases of interest), or for non-Lipschitz models, at the price of passing
the difficulty to the computation of the step. Since this complexity bound is
identical in order to that already known for purely Lipschitzian minimization
subject to convex constraints [CartGoulToin2016], the new result shows that
introducing non-Lipschitzian singularities in the objective function may not
affect the worst-case evaluation complexity order. The result also shows that
using the problem's partially separable structure (if present) does not affect
complexity order either. A final (worse) complexity bound is derived for the
case where Taylor models are used with a general convex feasible set.

 <dc:description>  As compared to the traditional advertising, the word-of-mouth (WOM)
communications have striking advantages such as significantly lower cost and
rapid delivery; this is especially the case with the popularity of online
social networks. This paper addresses the issue of maximizing the overall
profit of a WOM marketing campaign. A marketing process with both positive and
negative WOM is modeled as a dynamical model knwn as the SIPNS model, and the
profit maximization problem is modeled as a constrained optimization problem.
The influence of different factors on the dynamics of the SIPNS model is
revealed experimentally. Also, the impact of different factors on the expected
overall profit of a WOM marketing campaign is uncovered experimentally. On this
basis, some promotion strategies are suggested. To our knowledge, this is the
first time a WOM marketing campaign is treated this way.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we provide a method to recover off-the-grid frequencies of a
signal in two-dimensional (2-D) line spectral estimation. Most of the
literature in this field focuses on the case in which the only information is
spectral sparsity in a continuous domain and does not consider prior
information. However, in many applications such as radar and sonar, one has
extra information about the spectrum of the signal of interest. The common way
of accommodating prior information is to use weighted atomic norm minimization.
We present a new semidefinite program using the theory of positive
trigonometric polynomials that incorporate this prior information into 2-D line
spectral estimation. Specifically, we assume prior knowledge of 2-D frequency
subbands in which signal frequency components are located. Our approach
improves the recovery performance compared with the previous work that does not
consider prior information. Through numerical experiments, we find out that the
amount of this improvement depends on prior information we have about the
locations of the true frequencies.

 <dc:title>Second-order Temporal Pooling for Action Recognition</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Most successful deep learning models for action recognition generate
predictions for short video clips, which are later aggregated into a longer
time-frame action descriptor by computing a statistic over these predictions.
Zeroth (max) or first order (average) statistic are commonly used. In this
paper, we explore the benefits of using second-order statistics. Specifically,
we propose a novel end-to-end learnable action pooling scheme, temporal
correlation pooling, that generates an action descriptor for a video sequence
by capturing the similarities between the temporal evolution of per-frame CNN
features across the video. Such a descriptor, while being computationally
cheap, also naturally encodes the co-activations of multiple CNN features,
thereby providing a richer characterization of actions than their first-order
counterparts. We also propose higher-order extensions of this scheme by
computing correlations after embedding the CNN features in a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space. We provide experiments on four standard and fine-grained action
recognition datasets. Our results clearly demonstrate the advantages of
higher-order pooling schemes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

 <dc:title>A New Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme for the Interval Subset

 <dc:description>  The interval subset sum problem (ISSP) is a generalization of the well-known
subset sum problem. Given a set of intervals
$\left\{[a_{i,1},a_{i,2}]\right\}_{i=1}^n$ and a target integer $T,$ the ISSP
is to find a set of integers, at most one from each interval, such that their
sum best approximates the target $T$ but cannot exceed it. In this paper, we
first study the computational complexity of the ISSP. We show that the ISSP is
relatively easy to solve compared to the 0-1 Knapsack problem (KP). We also
identify several subclasses of the ISSP which are polynomial time solvable
(with high probability), albeit the problem is generally NP-hard. Then, we
propose a new fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for solving
the general ISSP problem. The time and space complexities of the proposed
scheme are ${\cal O}\left(n \max\left\{1 / \epsilon,\log n\right\}\right)$ and
${\cal O}\left(n+1/\epsilon\right),$ respectively, where $\epsilon$ is the
relative approximation error. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme
has almost the same time complexity but a significantly lower space complexity
compared to the best known scheme. Both the correctness and efficiency of the
proposed scheme are validated by numerical simulations. In particular, the
proposed scheme successfully solves ISSP instances with $n=100,000$ and
$\epsilon=0.1\%$ within one second.

 <dc:description>  Information delivery using chemical molecules is an integral part of biology
at multiple distance scales and has attracted recent interest in bioengineering
and communication theory. Potential applications include cooperative networks
with a large number of simple devices that could be randomly located (e.g., due
to mobility). This paper presents the first tractable analytical model for the
collective signal strength due to randomly-placed transmitters in a
three-dimensional (3D) large-scale molecular communication system, either with
or without degradation in the propagation environment. Transmitter locations in
an unbounded and homogeneous fluid are modelled as a homogeneous Poisson point
process. By applying stochastic geometry, analytical expressions are derived
for the expected number of molecules absorbed by a fully-absorbing receiver or
observed by a passive receiver. The bit error probability is derived under
ON/OFF keying and either a constant or adaptive decision threshold. Results
reveal that the combined signal strength increases proportionately with the
transmitter density, and the minimum bit error probability can be improved by
introducing molecule degradation. Furthermore, the analysis of the system can
be generalized to other receiver designs and other performance characteristics
in large-scale molecular communication systems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study a new learning paradigm for Neural Machine
Translation (NMT). Instead of maximizing the likelihood of the human
translation as in previous works, we minimize the distinction between human
translation and the translation given by an NMT model. To achieve this goal,
inspired by the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GANs), we
employ an adversarial training architecture and name it as Adversarial-NMT. In
Adversarial-NMT, the training of the NMT model is assisted by an adversary,
which is an elaborately designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal
of the adversary is to differentiate the translation result generated by the
NMT model from that by human. The goal of the NMT model is to produce high
quality translations so as to cheat the adversary. A policy gradient method is
leveraged to co-train the NMT model and the adversary. Experimental results on
English$\rightarrow$French and German$\rightarrow$English translation tasks
show that Adversarial-NMT can achieve significantly better translation quality
than several strong baselines.

 <dc:description>  While Monte Carlo Tree Search and closely related methods have dominated
General Video Game Playing, recent research has demonstrated the promise of
Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms as an interesting alternative. However,
there is little attention paid to population initialization techniques in the
setting of general real-time video games. Therefore, this paper proposes the
use of population seeding to improve the performance of Rolling Horizon
Evolution and presents the results of two methods, One Step Look Ahead and
Monte Carlo Tree Search, tested on 20 games of the General Video Game AI corpus
with multiple evolution parameter values (population size and individual
length). An in-depth analysis is carried out between the results of the seeding
methods and the vanilla Rolling Horizon Evolution. In addition, the paper
presents a comparison to a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm. The results are
promising, with seeding able to boost performance significantly over baseline
evolution and even match the high level of play obtained by the Monte Carlo
Tree Search.

framework for Artificial General Intelligence research in the video-games

agent for General Video Game AI framework. A Deep Q-Network algorithm was
applied and improved to develop an agent capable of learning to play different

different categories and difficulty levels, the results suggest that our

different games using only a single learning algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Finding the optimal encoding strategies can be challenging for communication
using quantum channels, as classical and quantum capacities may be
superadditive. Entanglement assistance can often simplify this task, as the
entanglement-assisted classical capacity for any channel is additive, making
entanglement across channel uses unnecessary. If the entanglement assistance is
limited, the picture is much more unclear. Suppose the classical capacity is
superadditive, then the classical capacity with limited entanglement assistance
could retain superadditivity by continuity arguments. If the classical capacity
is additive, it is unknown if superadditivity can still be developed with
limited entanglement assistance. We show this is possible, by providing an
example. We construct a channel for which, the classical capacity is additive,
but that with limited entanglement assistance can be superadditive. This shows
entanglement plays a weird role in communication and we still understand very
little about it.

 <dc:description>  Our goal is to create a convenient natural language interface for performing
well-specified but complex actions such as analyzing data, manipulating text,
and querying databases. However, existing natural language interfaces for such
tasks are quite primitive compared to the power one wields with a programming
language. To bridge this gap, we start with a core programming language and
allow users to &quot;naturalize&quot; the core language incrementally by defining
alternative, more natural syntax and increasingly complex concepts in terms of
compositions of simpler ones. In a voxel world, we show that a community of
users can simultaneously teach a common system a diverse language and use it to
build hundreds of complex voxel structures. Over the course of three days,
these users went from using only the core language to using the naturalized
language in 85.9\% of the last 10K utterances.

 <dc:description>  Several approaches have recently been proposed for learning decentralized
deep multiagent policies that coordinate via a differentiable communication
channel. While these policies are effective for many tasks, interpretation of
their induced communication strategies has remained a challenge. Here we
propose to interpret agents' messages by translating them. Unlike in typical
machine translation problems, we have no parallel data to learn from. Instead
we develop a translation model based on the insight that agent messages and
natural language strings mean the same thing if they induce the same belief
about the world in a listener. We present theoretical guarantees and empirical
evidence that our approach preserves both the semantics and pragmatics of
messages by ensuring that players communicating through a translation layer do
not suffer a substantial loss in reward relative to players with a common
language.

 <dc:title>Coherent multiple-antenna block-fading channels at finite blocklength</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Collins, Austin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Polyanskiy, Yury</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider a channel model that is often used to describe the
mobile wireless scenario: multiple-antenna additive white Gaussian noise
channels subject to random (fading) gain with full channel state information at
the receiver. Dynamics of the fading process are approximated by a
piecewise-constant process (frequency non-selective isotropic block fading).
This work addresses the finite blocklength fundamental limits of this channel
model. Specifically, we give a formula for the channel dispersion -- a quantity
governing the delay required to achieve capacity. Multiplicative nature of the
fading disturbance leads to a number of interesting technical difficulties that
required us to enhance traditional methods for finding channel dispersion.
Alas, one difficulty remains: the converse (impossibility) part of our result
holds under an extra constraint on the growth of the peak-power with
blocklength.
  Our results demonstrate, for example, that while capacities of $n_t\times
n_r$ and $n_r \times n_t$ antenna configurations coincide (under fixed received
power), the coding delay can be quite sensitive to this switch. For example, at
the received SNR of $20$ dB the $16\times 100$ system achieves capacity with
codes of length (delay) which is only $60\%$ of the length required for the
$100\times 16$ system. Another interesting implication is that for the MISO
channel, the dispersion-optimal coding schemes require employing orthogonal
designs such as Alamouti's scheme -- a surprising observation considering the
fact that Alamouti's scheme was designed for reducing demodulation errors, not
improving coding rate.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in 3D vision have demonstrated the strengths of photometric
bundle adjustment. By directly minimizing reprojected pixel errors, instead of
geometric reprojection errors, such methods can achieve sub-pixel alignment
accuracy in both high and low textured regions. Typically, these problems are
solved using a forwards compositional Lucas-Kanade formulation parameterized by
6-DoF rigid camera poses and a depth per point in the structure. For large
problems the most CPU-intensive component of the pipeline is the creation and
factorization of the Hessian matrix at each iteration. For many warps, the
inverse compositional formulation can offer significant speed-ups since the
Hessian need only be inverted once. In this paper, we show that an ordinary
inverse compositional formulation does not work for warps of this type of
parameterization due to ill-conditioning of its partial derivatives. However,
we show that it is possible to overcome this limitation by introducing the
concept of a proxy template image. We show an order of magnitude improvement in
speed, with little effect on quality, going from forwards to inverse
compositional in our own photometric bundle adjustment method designed for
object-centric structure from motion. This means less processing time for large
systems or denser reconstructions under the same real-time constraints. We
additionally show that this theory can be readily applied to existing methods
by integrating it with the recently released Direct Sparse Odometry SLAM
algorithm.

 <dc:title>The Art Gallery Problem is $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We prove that the art gallery problem is equivalent under polynomial time
reductions to deciding whether a system of polynomial equations over the real
numbers has a solution. The art gallery problem is a classical problem in
computational geometry. Given a simple polygon $P$ and an integer $k$, the goal
is to decide if there exists a set $G$ of $k$ guards within $P$ such that every
point $p\in P$ is seen by at least one guard $g\in G$. Each guard corresponds
to a point in the polygon $P$, and we say that a guard $g$ sees a point $p$ if
the line segment $pg$ is contained in $P$.
  The art gallery problem has stimulated extensive research in geometry and in
algorithms. However, the complexity status of the art gallery problem has not
been resolved. It has long been known that the problem is $\text{NP}$-hard, but
no one has been able to show that it lies in $\text{NP}$. Recently, the
computational geometry community became more aware of the complexity class
$\exists \mathbb{R}$. The class $\exists \mathbb{R}$ consists of problems that
can be reduced in polynomial time to the problem of deciding whether a system
of polynomial equations with integer coefficients and any number of real
variables has a solution. It can be easily seen that $\text{NP}\subseteq
\exists \mathbb{R}$. We prove that the art gallery problem is $\exists
\mathbb{R}$-complete, implying that (1) any system of polynomial equations over
the real numbers can be encoded as an instance of the art gallery problem, and
(2) the art gallery problem is not in the complexity class $\text{NP}$ unless
$\text{NP}=\exists \mathbb{R}$. As a corollary of our construction, we prove
that for any real algebraic number $\alpha$ there is an instance of the art
gallery problem where one of the coordinates of the guards equals $\alpha$ in
any guard set of minimum cardinality. That rules out many geometric approaches
to the problem.

 <dc:description>  We demonstrate that a continuous relaxation of the argmax operation can be
used to create a differentiable approximation to greedy decoding for
sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. By incorporating this approximation into
the scheduled sampling training procedure (Bengio et al., 2015)--a well-known
technique for correcting exposure bias--we introduce a new training objective
that is continuous and differentiable everywhere and that can provide
informative gradients near points where previous decoding decisions change
their value. In addition, by using a related approximation, we demonstrate a
similar approach to sampled-based training. Finally, we show that our approach
outperforms cross-entropy training and scheduled sampling procedures in two
sequence prediction tasks: named entity recognition and machine translation.

 <dc:description>  Recently, there has been a lot of interest in automatically generating
descriptions for an image. Most existing language-model based approaches for
this task learn to generate an image description word by word in its original
word order. However, for humans, it is more natural to locate the objects and
their relationships first, and then elaborate on each object, describing
notable attributes. We present a coarse-to-fine method that decomposes the
original image description into a skeleton sentence and its attributes, and
generates the skeleton sentence and attribute phrases separately. By this
decomposition, our method can generate more accurate and novel descriptions
than the previous state-of-the-art. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and a
larger scale Stock3M datasets show that our algorithm yields consistent
improvements across different evaluation metrics, especially on the SPICE
metric, which has much higher correlation with human ratings than the
conventional metrics. Furthermore, our algorithm can generate descriptions with
varied length, benefiting from the separate control of the skeleton and
attributes. This enables image description generation that better accommodates
user preferences.

 <dc:description>  ROOT provides an flexible format used throughout the HEP community. The
number of use cases - from an archival data format to end-stage analysis - has
required a number of tradeoffs to be exposed to the user. For example, a high
&quot;compression level&quot; in the traditional DEFLATE algorithm will result in a
smaller file (saving disk space) at the cost of slower decompression (costing
CPU time when read). At the scale of the LHC experiment, poor design choices
can result in terabytes of wasted space or wasted CPU time. We explore and
attempt to quantify some of these tradeoffs. Specifically, we explore: the use
of alternate compressing algorithms to optimize for read performance; an
alternate method of compressing individual events to allow efficient random
access; and a new approach to whole-file compression. Quantitative results are
given, as well as guidance on how to make compression decisions for different
use cases.

 <dc:title>Efficiently Computing Real Roots of Sparse Polynomials</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Symbolic Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.2.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose an efficient algorithm to compute the real roots of a sparse
polynomial $f\in\mathbb{R}[x]$ having $k$ non-zero real-valued coefficients. It
is assumed that arbitrarily good approximations of the non-zero coefficients
are given by means of a coefficient oracle. For a given positive integer $L$,
our algorithm returns disjoint disks
$\Delta_{1},\ldots,\Delta_{s}\subset\mathbb{C}$, with $s&lt;2k$, centered at the
real axis and of radius less than $2^{-L}$ together with positive integers
$\mu_{1},\ldots,\mu_{s}$ such that each disk $\Delta_{i}$ contains exactly
$\mu_{i}$ roots of $f$ counted with multiplicity. In addition, it is ensured
that each real root of $f$ is contained in one of the disks. If $f$ has only
simple real roots, our algorithm can also be used to isolate all real roots.
  The bit complexity of our algorithm is polynomial in $k$ and $\log n$, and
near-linear in $L$ and $\tau$, where $2^{-\tau}$ and $2^{\tau}$ constitute
lower and upper bounds on the absolute values of the non-zero coefficients of
$f$, and $n$ is the degree of $f$. For root isolation, the bit complexity is
polynomial in $k$ and $\log n$, and near-linear in $\tau$ and
$\log\sigma^{-1}$, where $\sigma$ denotes the separation of the real roots.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of online Min-cost Perfect Matching with Delays
(MPMD) introduced by Emek et al. (STOC 2016). In this problem, an even number
of requests appear in a metric space at different times and the goal of an
online algorithm is to match them in pairs. In contrast to traditional online
matching problems, in MPMD all requests appear online and an algorithm can
match any pair of requests, but such decision may be delayed (e.g., to find a
better match). The cost is the sum of matching distances and the introduced
delays.
  We present the first deterministic online algorithm for this problem. Its
competitive ratio is $O(m^{\log_2 5.5})$ $ = O(m^{2.46})$, where $2 m$ is the
number of requests. This is polynomial in the number of metric space points if
all requests are given at different points. In particular, the bound does not
depend on other parameters of the metric, such as its aspect ratio. Unlike
previous (randomized) solutions for the MPMD problem, our algorithm does not
need to know the metric space in advance.

 <dc:description>  The paper presents a novel method for designing an optimal controller for
discrete-time switched linear systems. The problem is formulated as one of
computing the discrete mode sequence and the continuous input sequence that
jointly minimize a quadratic performance index. State-of-art methods for
solving such a control problem suffer in general from a high computational
requirement due to the fact that an exponential number of switching sequences
must be explored. The method of this paper addresses the challenge of the
switching law design by introducing auxiliary continuous input variables and
then solving a non-smooth block-sparsity inducing optimization problem.

 <dc:description>  Fixed-vocabulary language models fail to account for one of the most
characteristic statistical facts of natural language: the frequent creation and
reuse of new word types. Although character-level language models offer a
partial solution in that they can create word types not attested in the
training corpus, they do not capture the &quot;bursty&quot; distribution of such words.
In this paper, we augment a hierarchical LSTM language model that generates
sequences of word tokens character by character with a caching mechanism that
learns to reuse previously generated words. To validate our model we construct
a new open-vocabulary language modeling corpus (the Multilingual Wikipedia
Corpus, MWC) from comparable Wikipedia articles in 7 typologically diverse
languages and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model across this range of
languages.

 <dc:description>  Desynchronization is one of the primitive services for complex networks
because it arranges nodes to take turns accessing a shared resource. TDMA is a
practical application of desynchronization because it allows node to share a
common medium. In this paper, we propose a novel desynchronization algorithm
using artificial force field called Multi-hop Desynchronization With an
ARtificial Force field or M-DWARF and use it to solve TDMA problems in wireless
sensor networks (WSNs). M-DWARF solves hidden terminal problems in multi-hop
networks by using relative time relaying and improves resource utilization by
employing force absorption. M-DWARF is suitable for use in WSNs because of its
low complexity and autonomous operations. We implement M-DWARF using TinyOS and
experiment it on both TelosB motes and TOSSIM. From our investigation, M-DWARF
is the only desynchronization algorithm that achieves fast convergence with
high stability, while maintaining channel utilization fairness. Moreover, we
are the first to provide a stability analysis using dynamical systems and to
prove that M-DWARF is stable at equilibrium. (This paper is the first part of

 <dc:description>  Session types offer a type-based discipline for enforcing communication
protocols in distributed programming. We have previously formalized simple
session types in the setting of multi-threaded $\lambda$-calculus with linear
types. In this work, we build upon our earlier work by presenting a form of
dependent session types (of DML-style). The type system we formulate provides
linearity and duality guarantees with no need for any runtime checks or special
encodings. Our formulation of dependent session types is the first of its kind,
and it is particularly suitable for practical implementation. As an example, we
describe one implementation written in ATS that compiles to an Erlang/Elixir
back-end.

simulation. We validate its functionalities on TelosB motes and compare its
performance with EXT-DESYNC, and LIGHTWEIGHT on TOSSIM. On simulation, we test
the algorithms on several multihop topologies and discuss both the average and
problematic cases. In addition, we investigate the impacts of period length (T)
and compare channel utilization fairness among the desynchronization
algorithms. Finally, we propose a method to reduce desynchronization overhead.

 <dc:title>New Two-Stage Automorphism Group Decoders for Cyclic Codes in the
  Erasure Channel</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kim, Chanki</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>No, Jong-Seon</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, error correcting codes in the erasure channel have drawn great
attention for various applications such as distributed storage systems and
wireless sensor networks, but many of their decoding algorithms are not
practical because they have higher decoding complexity and longer delay. Thus,
the automorphism group decoder (AGD) for cyclic codes in the erasure channel
was introduced, which has good erasure decoding performance with low decoding
complexity. In this paper, we propose new two-stage AGDs (TS-AGDs) for cyclic
codes in the erasure channel by modifying the parity check matrix and
introducing the preprocessing stage to the AGD scheme. The proposed TS-AGD has
been analyzed for the perfect codes, BCH codes, and maximum distance separable
(MDS) codes. Through numerical analysis, it is shown that the proposed decoding
algorithm has good erasure decoding performance with lower decoding complexity
and delay than the conventional AGD. For some cyclic codes, it is shown that
the proposed TS-AGD achieves the perfect decoding in the erasure channel, that
is, the same decoding performance as the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder. For
MDS codes, TS-AGDs with the expanded parity check matrix and the submatrix
inversion are also proposed and analyzed.

desynchronization algorithms at equilibrium. We start by illustrating the
equilibrium of a dynamic systems and formalizing force components and time
phases. Then, we use Linear Approximation to obtain Jaconian (J) matrixes which
are used to find the eigenvalues. Next, we employ the Hirst and Macey theorem
and Gershgorins theorem to find the bounds of those eigenvalues. Finally, if
the number of nodes (n) is within such bounds, the systems are stable at
equilibrium. (This paper is the last part of the series Stable

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of constructing good space-time codes for broadcasting
$K$ independent messages over a MIMO network to $L$ users, where each user
demands all the messages and already has a subset of messages as side
information. As a first attempt, we consider the $2\times 2$ case and propose
golden-coded index coding by partitioning the golden codes into $K$ subcodes,
one for each message. The proposed scheme is shown to have the property that
for any side information configuration, the minimum determinant of the code
increases exponentially with the amount of information contained in the side
information.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  WiFi MAC architecture supports aggregation at two layers. The MAC service
data units (MSDUs) can be aggregated to form AMSDUs. Each AMSDU serves as a
single MAC protocol data unit (MPDU). Another layer of aggregation is
introduced when MPDUs can be packed together to deliver an aggregated MPDU
(AMPDU). In this brief tutorial we discuss (1) why aggregation is useful at
all, (2) why two layers of aggregation are required, (3) trade-offs for
aggregating at different layers.

 <dc:description>  The inherent noise in the observed (e.g., scanned) binary document image
degrades the image quality and harms the compression ratio through breaking the
pattern repentance and adding entropy to the document images. In this paper, we
design a cost function in Bayesian framework with dictionary learning.
Minimizing our cost function produces a restored image which has better quality
than that of the observed noisy image, and a dictionary for representing and
encoding the image. After the restoration, we use this dictionary (from the
same cost function) to encode the restored image following the
symbol-dictionary framework by JBIG2 standard with the lossless mode.
Experimental results with a variety of document images demonstrate that our
method improves the image quality compared with the observed image, and
simultaneously improves the compression ratio. For the test images with
synthetic noise, our method reduces the number of flipped pixels by 48.2% and
improves the compression ratio by 36.36% as compared with the best encoding
methods. For the test images with real noise, our method visually improves the
image quality, and outperforms the cutting-edge method by 28.27% in terms of
the compression ratio.

 <dc:description>  Patch-based sparse representation modeling has shown great potential in image
compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction. However, this model usually suffers
from some limits, such as dictionary learning with great computational
complexity, neglecting the relationship among similar patches. In this paper, a
group-based sparse representation method with non-convex regularization
(GSR-NCR) for image CS reconstruction is proposed. In GSR-NCR, the local
sparsity and nonlocal self-similarity of images is simultaneously considered in
a unified framework. Different from the previous methods based on
sparsity-promoting convex regularization, we extend the non-convex weighted Lp
(0 &lt; p &lt; 1) penalty function on group sparse coefficients of the data matrix,
rather than conventional L1-based regularization. To reduce the computational
complexity, instead of learning the dictionary with a high computational
complexity from natural images, we learn the principle component analysis (PCA)
based dictionary for each group. Moreover, to make the proposed scheme
tractable and robust, we have developed an efficient iterative
shrinkage/thresholding algorithm to solve the non-convex optimization problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many
state-of-the-art techniques for image CS reconstruction.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigate several computational problems related to the stochastic
convex hull (SCH). Given a stochastic dataset consisting of $n$ points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ each of which has an existence probability, a SCH refers to the
convex hull of a realization of the dataset, i.e., a random sample including
each point with its existence probability. We are interested in computing
certain expected statistics of a SCH, including diameter, width, and
combinatorial complexity. For diameter, we establish the first deterministic
1.633-approximation algorithm with a time complexity polynomial in both $n$ and
$d$. For width, two approximation algorithms are provided: a deterministic
$O(1)$-approximation running in $O(n^{d+1} \log n)$ time, and a fully
polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS). For combinatorial
complexity, we propose an exact $O(n^d)$-time algorithm. Our solutions exploit
many geometric insights in Euclidean space, some of which might be of
independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication technologies have recently emerged as
an attractive solution to meet the exponentially increasing demand on mobile
data traffic. Moreover, ultra dense networks (UDNs) combined with mmWave
technology are expected to increase both energy efficiency and spectral
efficiency. In this paper, user association and power allocation in mmWave
based UDNs is considered with attention to load balance constraints, energy
harvesting by base stations, user quality of service requirements, energy
efficiency, and cross-tier interference limits. The joint user association and
power optimization problem is modeled as a mixed-integer programming problem,
which is then transformed into a convex optimization problem by relaxing the
user association indicator and solved by Lagrangian dual decomposition. An
iterative gradient user association and power allocation algorithm is proposed
and shown to converge rapidly to an optimal point. The complexity of the
proposed algorithm is analyzed and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme
compared with existing methods is verified by simulations.

 <dc:description>  The fifth-generation (5G) networks are expected to be able to satisfy users'
different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Network slicing is a promising
technology for 5G networks to provide services tailored for users' specific QoS
demands. Driven by the increased massive wireless data traffic from different
application scenarios, efficient resource allocation schemes should be
exploited to improve the flexibility of network resource allocation and
capacity of 5G networks based on network slicing. Due to the diversity of 5G
application scenarios, new mobility management schemes are greatly needed to
guarantee seamless handover in network slicing based 5G systems. In this
article, we introduce a logical architecture for network slicing based 5G
systems, and present a scheme for managing mobility between different access
networks, as well as a joint power and subchannel allocation scheme in
spectrum-sharing two-tier systems based on network slicing, where both the
co-tier interference and cross-tier interference are taken into account.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation scheme can
flexibly allocate network resources between different slices in 5G systems.
Finally, several open issues and challenges in network slicing based 5G
networks are discussed, including network reconstruction, network slicing
management and cooperation with other 5G technologies.

segmentation. However, both training and working procedures of the current
neural models are computationally inefficient. This paper presents a greedy

performing segmentation much faster and even more accurate than
state-of-the-art neural models on Chinese benchmark datasets.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an efficient vehicle trajectory prediction
framework based on recurrent neural network. Basically, the characteristic of
the vehicle's trajectory is different from that of regular moving objects since
it is affected by various latent factors including road structure, traffic
rules, and driver's intention. Previous state of the art approaches use
sophisticated vehicle behavior model describing these factors and derive the
complex trajectory prediction algorithm, which requires a system designer to
conduct intensive model optimization for practical use. Our approach is
data-driven and simple to use in that it learns complex behavior of the
vehicles from the massive amount of trajectory data through deep neural network
model. The proposed trajectory prediction method employs the recurrent neural
network called long short-term memory (LSTM) to analyze the temporal behavior
and predict the future coordinate of the surrounding vehicles. The proposed
scheme feeds the sequence of vehicles' coordinates obtained from sensor
measurements to the LSTM and produces the probabilistic information on the
future location of the vehicles over occupancy grid map. The experiments
conducted using the data collected from highway driving show that the proposed
method can produce reasonably good estimate of future trajectory.

 <dc:description>  Global constraints and reranking have not been used in cognates detection
research to date. We propose methods for using global constraints by performing
rescoring of the score matrices produced by state of the art cognates detection
systems. Using global constraints to perform rescoring is complementary to
state of the art methods for performing cognates detection and results in
significant performance improvements beyond current state of the art
performance on publicly available datasets with different language pairs and
various conditions such as different levels of baseline state of the art
performance and different data size conditions, including with more realistic
large data size conditions than have been evaluated with in the past.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural network (RNN) are being extensively used over feed-forward
neural networks (FFNN) because of their inherent capability to capture temporal
relationships that exist in the sequential data such as speech. This aspect of
RNN is advantageous especially when there is no a priori knowledge about the
temporal correlations within the data. However, RNNs require large amount of
data to learn these temporal correlations, limiting their advantage in low
resource scenarios. It is not immediately clear (a) how a priori temporal
knowledge can be used in a FFNN architecture (b) how a FFNN performs when
provided with this knowledge about temporal correlations (assuming available)
during training. The objective of this paper is to explore k-FFNN, namely a
FFNN architecture that can incorporate the a priori knowledge of the temporal
relationships within the data sequence during training and compare k-FFNN
performance with RNN in a low resource scenario. We evaluate the performance of
k-FFNN and RNN by extensive experimentation on MediaEval 2016 audio data
(&quot;Emotional Impact of Movies&quot; task). Experimental results show that the
performance of k-FFNN is comparable to RNN, and in some scenarios k-FFNN
performs better than RNN when temporal knowledge is injected into FFNN
architecture. The main contributions of this paper are (a) fusing a priori
knowledge into FFNN architecture to construct a k-FFNN and (b) analyzing the
performance of k-FFNN with respect to RNN for different size of training data.

 <dc:title>Non-Convex Weighted Lp Nuclear Norm based ADMM Framework for Image
  Restoration</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Since the matrix formed by nonlocal similar patches in a natural image is of
low rank, the nuclear norm minimization (NNM) has been widely used in various
image processing studies. Nonetheless, nuclear norm based convex surrogate of
the rank function usually over-shrinks the rank components and makes different
components equally, and thus may produce a result far from the optimum. To
alleviate the above-mentioned limitations of the nuclear norm, in this paper we
propose a new method for image restoration via the non-convex weighted Lp
nuclear norm minimization (NCW-NNM), which is able to more accurately enforce
the image structural sparsity and self-similarity simultaneously. To make the
proposed model tractable and robust, the alternative direction multiplier
method (ADMM) is adopted to solve the associated non-convex minimization
problem. Experimental results on various types of image restoration problems,
including image deblurring, image inpainting and image compressive sensing (CS)
recovery, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many current
state-of-the-art methods in both the objective and the perceptual qualities.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that the entropy $H(X)$ of a finite random variable is
always greater or equal to the entropy $H(f(X))$ of a function $f$ of $X$, with
equality if and only if $f$ is one-to-one. In this paper, we give tights bounds
on $H(f(X))$ when the function $f$ is not one-to-one, and we illustrate a few
scenarios where this matters. As an intermediate step towards our main result,
we prove a lower bound on the entropy of a probability distribution, when only
a bound on the ratio between the maximum and the minimum probability is known.
Our lower bound improves previous results in the literature, and it could find
applications outside the present scenario.

 <dc:title>A Dual Sparse Decomposition Method for Image Denoising</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This article addresses the image denoising problem in the situations of
strong noise. We propose a dual sparse decomposition method. This method makes
a sub-dictionary decomposition on the over-complete dictionary in the sparse
decomposition. The sub-dictionary decomposition makes use of a novel criterion
based on the occurrence frequency of atoms of the over-complete dictionary over
the data set. The experimental results demonstrate that the
dual-sparse-decomposition method surpasses state-of-art denoising performance
in terms of both peak-signal-to-noise ratio and
structural-similarity-index-metric, and also at subjective visual quality.

 <dc:title>Rerouting flows when links fail</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We introduce and investigate reroutable flows, a robust version of network
flows in which link failures can be mitigated by rerouting the affected flow.
Given a capacitated network, a path flow is reroutable if after failure of an
arbitrary arc, we can reroute the interrupted flow from the tail of that arc to
the sink, without modifying the flow that is not affected by the failure.
Similar types of restoration, which are often termed &quot;local&quot;, were previously
investigated in the context of network design, such as min-cost capacity
planning. In this paper, our interest is in computing maximum flows under this
robustness assumption. An important new feature of our model, distinguishing it
from existing max robust flow models, is that no flow can get lost in the
network.
  We also study a tightening of reroutable flows, called strictly reroutable
flows, making more restrictive assumptions on the capacities available for
rerouting. For both variants, we devise a reroutable-flow equivalent of an
s-t-cut and show that the corresponding max flow/min cut gap is bounded by 2.
It turns out that a strictly reroutable flow of maximum value can be found
using a compact LP formulation, whereas the problem of finding a maximum
reroutable flow is NP-hard, even when all capacities are in {1, 2}. However,
the tightening can be used to get a 2-approximation for reroutable flows. This
ratio is tight in general networks, but we show that in the case of unit
capacities, every reroutable flow can be transformed into a strictly reroutable
flow of same value. While it is NP-hard to compute a maximal integral flow even
for unit capacities, we devise a surprisingly simple combinatorial algorithm
that finds a half-integral strictly reroutable flow of value 1, or certifies
that no such solutions exits. Finally, we also give a hardness result for the
case of multiple arc failures.

 <dc:title>Diffusion geometry unravels the emergence of functional clusters in
  collective phenomena</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Collective phenomena emerge from the interaction of natural or artificial
units with a complex organization. The interplay between structural patterns
and dynamics might induce functional clusters that, in general, are different
from topological ones. In biological systems, like the human brain, the overall
functionality is often favored by the interplay between connectivity and
synchronization dynamics, with functional clusters that do not coincide with
anatomical modules in most cases. In social, socio-technical and engineering
systems, the quest for consensus favors the emergence of clusters.
  Despite the unquestionable evidence for mesoscale organization of many
complex systems and the heterogeneity of their inter-connectivity, a way to
predict and identify the emergence of functional modules in collective
phenomena continues to elude us. Here, we propose an approach based on random
walk dynamics to define the diffusion distance between any pair of units in a
networked system. Such a metric allows to exploit the underlying diffusion
geometry to provide a unifying framework for the intimate relationship between
metastable synchronization, consensus and random search dynamics in complex
networks, pinpointing the functional mesoscale organization of synthetic and
biological systems.

 <dc:description>  Agent modelling involves considering how other agents will behave, in order
to influence your own actions. In this paper, we explore the use of agent
modelling in the hidden-information, collaborative card game Hanabi. We
implement a number of rule-based agents, both from the literature and of our
own devising, in addition to an Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search
(IS-MCTS) agent. We observe poor results from IS-MCTS, so construct a new,
predictor version that uses a model of the agents with which it is paired. We
observe a significant improvement in game-playing strength from this agent in
comparison to IS-MCTS, resulting from its consideration of what the other
agents in a game would do. In addition, we create a flawed rule-based agent to
highlight the predictor's capabilities with such an agent.

 <dc:description>  Time-varying, smooth trajectory estimation is of great interest to the vision
community for accurate and well behaving 3D systems. In this paper, we propose
a novel principal component local regression filter acting directly on the
Riemannian manifold of unit dual quaternions $\mathbb{D} \mathbb{H}_1$. We use
a numerically stable Lie algebra of the dual quaternions together with $\exp$
and $\log$ operators to locally linearize the 6D pose space. Unlike state of
the art path smoothing methods which either operate on $SO\left(3\right)$ of
rotation matrices or the hypersphere $\mathbb{H}_1$ of quaternions, we treat
the orientation and translation jointly on the dual quaternion quadric in the
7-dimensional real projective space $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^7$. We provide an
outlier-robust IRLS algorithm for generic pose filtering exploiting this
manifold structure. Besides our theoretical analysis, our experiments on
synthetic and real data show the practical advantages of the manifold aware
filtering on pose tracking and smoothing.

 <dc:description>  We propose a selective encoding model to extend the sequence-to-sequence
framework for abstractive sentence summarization. It consists of a sentence
encoder, a selective gate network, and an attention equipped decoder. The
sentence encoder and decoder are built with recurrent neural networks. The
selective gate network constructs a second level sentence representation by
controlling the information flow from encoder to decoder. The second level
representation is tailored for sentence summarization task, which leads to
better performance. We evaluate our model on the English Gigaword, DUC 2004 and
MSR abstractive sentence summarization datasets. The experimental results show
that the proposed selective encoding model outperforms the state-of-the-art
baseline models.

Algorithms and their potential at matching Tree Search level of play or even
outperforming these methods. Online or Rolling Horizon Evolution is one of the
options available to evolve sequences of actions for planning in General Video
Game Playing, but no research has been done up to date that explores the
capabilities of the vanilla version of this algorithm in multiple games. This
study aims to critically analyse the different configurations regarding
population size and individual length in a set of 20 games from the General
Video Game AI corpus. Distinctions are made between deterministic and
stochastic games, and the implications of using superior time budgets are
studied. Results show that there is scope for the use of these techniques,
which in some configurations outperform Monte Carlo Tree Search, and also
suggest that further research in these methods could boost their performance.

 <dc:title>Exploiting Multi-layer Graph Factorization for Multi-attributed Graph
  Matching</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Park, Han-Mu</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multi-attributed graph matching is a problem of finding correspondences
between two sets of data while considering their complex properties described
in multiple attributes. However, the information of multiple attributes is
likely to be oversimplified during a process that makes an integrated
attribute, and this degrades the matching accuracy. For that reason, a
multi-layer graph structure-based algorithm has been proposed recently. It can
effectively avoid the problem by separating attributes into multiple layers.
Nonetheless, there are several remaining issues such as a scalability problem
caused by the huge matrix to describe the multi-layer structure and a
back-projection problem caused by the continuous relaxation of the quadratic
assignment problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-attributed graph
matching algorithm based on the multi-layer graph factorization. We reformulate
the problem to be solved with several small matrices that are obtained by
factorizing the multi-layer structure. Then, we solve the problem using a
convex-concave relaxation procedure for the multi-layer structure. The proposed
algorithm exhibits better performance than state-of-the-art algorithms based on
the single-layer structure.

 <dc:description>  This paper treats the privacy-preserving publication of social graphs in the
presence of active adversaries, that is, adversaries with the ability to
introduce sybil nodes in the graph prior to publication and leverage them to
create unique fingerprints for a set of victim nodes and re-identify them after
publication. Stemming from the notion of $(k,\ell)$-anonymity, we introduce
$(k,\ell)$-anonymous transformations, characterising graph perturbation methods
that ensure protection from active adversaries levaraging up to $\ell$ sybil
nodes. Additionally, we introduce a new privacy property: $(k,\ell)$-adjacency
anonymity, which relaxes the assumption made by $(k,\ell)$-anonymity that
adversaries can control all distances between sybil nodes and the rest of the
nodes in the graph. The new privacy property is in turn the basis for a new
type of graph perturbation: $(k,\ell)$-adjacency anonymous transformations. We
propose algorithms for obtaining $(k,1)$-adjacency anonymous transformations
for arbitrary values of $k$, as well as $(2,\ell)$-adjacency anonymous
transformations for small values of $\ell$.

 <dc:description>  Communications using frequency bands in the millimeter-wave range can play a
key role in future generations of mobile networks. By allowing large bandwidth
allocations, high carrier frequencies will provide high data rates to support
the ever-growing capacity demand. The prevailing challenge at high frequencies
is the mitigation of large path loss and link blockage effects. Highly
directional beams are expected to overcome this challenge. In this paper, we
propose a stochastic model for characterizing beam coverage probability. The
model takes into account both line-of-sight and first-order non-line-of-sight
reflections. We model the scattering environment as a stochastic process and we
derive an analytical expression of the coverage probability for any given beam.
The results derived are validated numerically and compared with simulations to
assess the accuracy of the model.

 <dc:description>  Sparsity-regularized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging framework has
shown its remarkable performance to generate a feature enhanced high resolution
image, in which a sparsity-inducing regularizer is involved by exploiting the
sparsity priors of some visual features in the underlying image. However, since
the simple prior of low level features are insufficient to describe different
semantic contents in the image, this type of regularizer will be incapable of
distinguishing between the target of interest and unconcerned background
clutters. As a consequence, the features belonging to the target and clutters
are simultaneously affected in the generated image without concerning their
underlying semantic labels. To address this problem, we propose a novel
semantic information guided framework for target oriented SAR image formation,
which aims at enhancing the interested target scatters while suppressing the
background clutters. Firstly, we develop a new semantics-specific regularizer
for image formation by exploiting the statistical properties of different
semantic categories in a target scene SAR image. In order to infer the semantic
label for each pixel in an unsupervised way, we moreover induce a novel
high-level prior-driven regularizer and some semantic causal rules from the
prior knowledge. Finally, our regularized framework for image formation is
further derived as a simple iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$ minimization
problem which can be conveniently solved by many off-the-shelf solvers.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
framework for SAR image formation in terms of target enhancement and clutters
suppression, compared with the state of the arts. Additionally, the proposed
framework opens a new direction of devoting some machine learning strategies to
image formation, which can benefit the subsequent decision making tasks.

 <dc:description>  Person re-identification in large-scale multi-camera networks is a
challenging task because of the spatio-temporal uncertainty and high complexity
due to large numbers of cameras and people. To handle these difficulties,
additional information such as camera network topology should be provided,
which is also difficult to automatically estimate. In this paper, we propose a
unified framework which jointly solves both person re-id and camera network
topology inference problems. The proposed framework takes general multi-camera
network environments into account. To effectively show the superiority of the
proposed framework, we also provide a new person re-id dataset with full
annotations, named SLP, captured in the synchronized multi-camera network.
Experimental results show that the proposed methods are promising for both
person re-id and camera topology inference tasks.

 <dc:title>A Transient Queueing Analysis under Time-varying Arrival and Service

 <dc:description>  Understanding the detailed queueing behavior of a networking session is
critical in enabling low-latency services over the Internet. Especially when
the packet arrival and service rates at the queue of a link vary over time and
moreover when the session is short-lived, analyzing the corresponding queue
behavior as a function of time, which involves a transient analysis, becomes
extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose and develop a new analytical
framework that anatomizes the transient queue behavior under time-varying
arrival and service rates even under unstable conditions. Our framework is
capable of answering key questions in designing low-latency services such as
the time-dependent probability distribution of the queue length; the
instantaneous or time-averaged violation probability that the queue length
exceeds a certain threshold; and the fraction of time during an interval $[0,
t]$ at which the queue length exceeds a certain threshold. We validate our
framework by comparing its prediction results over time with the statistical
simulation results and confirm that our analysis is accurate enough. Our
extensive demonstrations on the efficacy of the analytical framework in
designing low-latency services reveal that its prediction ability for the
transient queue behavior in diverse time-varying packet arrival and service
patterns can be of a high practical value.

 <dc:description>  Parsing sentences to linguistically-expressive semantic representations is a
key goal of Natural Language Processing. Yet statistical parsing has focused
almost exclusively on bilexical dependencies or domain-specific logical forms.
We propose a neural encoder-decoder transition-based parser which is the first
full-coverage semantic graph parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS). The
model architecture uses stack-based embedding features, predicting graphs
jointly with unlexicalized predicates and their token alignments. Our parser is
more accurate than attention-based baselines on MRS, and on an additional
Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) benchmark, and GPU batch processing makes
it an order of magnitude faster than a high-precision grammar-based parser.
Further, the 86.69% Smatch score of our MRS parser is higher than the
upper-bound on AMR parsing, making MRS an attractive choice as a semantic
representation.

 <dc:description>  Software architectures usually are comprised of different views for capturing
static, runtime, and deployment aspects. What is currently missing, however,
are formal validation and verification techniques of multi-view architecture in
very early phases of the software development lifecycle. The main contribution
of this paper therefore is the construction of a single formal model (in
Promela) for certain stylized, and widely used, multi-view architectures by
suitably interpreting and fusing sub-models from different UML diagrams.
Possible counter-examples produced by model checking are fed back as test
scenarios for debugging the multi-view architectural model. We have implemented
this algorithm as a plug-in for the Enterprise Architect development tool, and
successfully used SPIN model checking for debugging some industrial
architectural multi-view models by identifying a number of undesirable corner
cases.

 <dc:description>  A memristive device is a novel passive device, which is essentially a
resistor with memory. This device can be utilized for novel technical
applications like neuromorphic computation. In this paper, we focus on
anticipation - a capability of a system to decide how to react in an
environment by predicting future states. Especially, we have designed an
elementary memristive circuit for the anticipation of digital patterns, where
this circuit is based on the capability of an amoeba to anticipate periodically
occurring unipolar pulses. The resulting circuit has been verified by digital
simulations and has been realized in hardware as well. For the practical
realization, we have used an Ag-doped TiO2-x-based memristive device, which has
been fabricated in planar capacitor structures on a silicon wafer. The
functionality of the circuit is shown by simulations and measurements. Finally,
the anticipation of information is demonstrated by using images, where the
robustness of this anticipatory circuit against noise and faulty intermediate
information is visualized.

 <dc:description>  Visual question answering (QA) has attracted a lot of attention lately, seen
essentially as a form of (visual) Turing test that artificial intelligence
should strive to achieve. In this paper, we study a crucial component of this
task: how can we design good datasets for the task? We focus on the design of
multiple-choice based datasets where the learner has to select the right answer
from a set of candidate ones including the target (i.e. the correct one) and
the decoys (i.e. the incorrect ones). Through careful analysis of the results
attained by state-of-the-art learning models and human annotators on existing
datasets, we show the design of the decoy answers has a significant impact on
how and what the learning models learn from the datasets. In particular, the
resulting learner can ignore the visual information, the question, or the both
while still doing well on the task. Inspired by this, we propose automatic
procedures to remedy such design deficiencies. We apply the procedures to
re-construct decoy answers for two popular visual QA datasets as well as to
create a new visual QA dataset from the Visual Genome project, resulting in the
largest dataset for this task. Extensive empirical studies show that the design
deficiencies have been alleviated in the remedied datasets and the performance
on them is likely a more faithful indicator of the difference among learning
models. The datasets are released and publicly available via
http://www.teds.usc.edu/website_vqa/.

 <dc:description>  With a plethora of available classification performance measures, choosing
the right metric for the right task requires careful thought. To make this
decision in an informed manner, one should study and compare general properties
of candidate measures. However, analysing measures with respect to complete
ranges of their domain values is a difficult and challenging task. In this
study, we attempt to support such analyses with a specialized visualization
technique, which operates in a barycentric coordinate system using a 3D
tetrahedron. Additionally, we adapt this technique to the context of imbalanced
data and put forward a set of properties which should be taken into account
when selecting a classification performance measure. As a result, we compare 22
popular measures and show important differences in their behaviour. Moreover,
for parametric measures such as the F$_{\beta}$ and IBA$_\alpha$(G-mean), we
analytically derive parameter thresholds that change measure properties.
Finally, we provide an online visualization tool that can aid the analysis of
complete domain ranges of performance measures.

 <dc:title>Joint Spectrum Reservation and On-demand Request for Mobile Virtual

 <dc:description>  With wireless network virtualization, Mobile Virtual Network Operators
(MVNOs) can develop new services on a low-cost platform by leasing virtual
resources from mobile network owners. In this paper, we investigate a two-stage
spectrum leasing framework, where an MVNO acquires radio spectrum through both
advance reservation and on-demand request. To maximize its surplus, the MVNO
jointly optimizes the amount of spectrum to lease in the two stages by taking
into account the traffic distribution, random user locations, wireless channel
statistics, Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, and the prices differences.
Meanwhile, the acquired spectrum resources are dynamically allocated to the
MVNO's mobile subscribers (users) according to fast channel fadings in order to
maximize the utilization of the resources. The MVNO's surplus maximization
problem is naturally formulated as a tri-level nested optimization problem that
consists of Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), on-demand request, and advance
reservation subproblems. To solve the problem efficiently, we rigorously
analyze the structure of the optimal solution in the DRA problem, and the
optimal value is used to find the optimal leasing decisions in the two stages.
In particular, we derive closed-form expressions of the optimal advance
reservation and on-demand requests when the proportional fair utility function
is adopted. We further extend the analysis to general utility functions and
derive a Stochastic Gradient Decent (SGD) algorithm to find the optimal leasing
decisions. Simulation results show that the two-stage spectrum leasing strategy
can take advantage of both the price discount of advance reservation and the
flexibility of on-demand request to deal with traffic variations.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a compositional approach to abstraction and safety
synthesis for a general class of discrete time nonlinear systems. Our approach
makes it possible to define a symbolic abstraction by composing a set of
symbolic subsystems that are overlapping in the sense that they can share some
common state variables. We develop compositional safety synthesis techniques
using such overlapping symbolic subsystems. Comparisons, in terms of
conservativeness and of computational complexity, between abstractions and
controllers obtained from different system decompositions are provided.
Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach for symbolic control
synthesis enables a significant complexity reduction with respect to the
centralized approach, while reducing the conservatism with respect to
compositional approaches using non-overlapping subsystems.

 <dc:description>  A large amount of recent research has focused on tasks that combine language
and vision, resulting in a proliferation of datasets and methods. One such task
is action recognition, whose applications include image annotation, scene
under- standing and image retrieval. In this survey, we categorize the existing
ap- proaches based on how they conceptualize this problem and provide a
detailed review of existing datasets, highlighting their di- versity as well as
advantages and disad- vantages. We focus on recently devel- oped datasets which
link visual informa- tion with linguistic resources and provide a fine-grained
syntactic and semantic anal- ysis of actions in images.

 <dc:description>  We study a symmetric collaborative dialogue setting in which two agents, each
with private knowledge, must strategically communicate to achieve a common
goal. The open-ended dialogue state in this setting poses new challenges for
existing dialogue systems. We collected a dataset of 11K human-human dialogues,
which exhibits interesting lexical, semantic, and strategic elements. To model
both structured knowledge and unstructured language, we propose a neural model
with dynamic knowledge graph embeddings that evolve as the dialogue progresses.
Automatic and human evaluations show that our model is both more effective at
achieving the goal and more human-like than baseline neural and rule-based
models.

 <dc:title>Beeping a Maximal Independent Set Fast</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Holzer, Stephan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lynch, Nancy</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We adapt a recent algorithm by Ghaffari [SODA'16] for computing a Maximal
Independent Set in the LOCAL model, so that it works in the significantly
weaker BEEP model. For networks with maximum degree $\Delta$, our algorithm
terminates locally within time $O((\log \Delta + \log (1/\epsilon)) \cdot
\log(1/\epsilon))$, with probability at least $1 - \epsilon$. The key idea of
the modification is to replace explicit messages about transmission
probabilities with estimates based on the number of received messages.
  After the successful introduction (and implicit use) of local analysis, e.g.,
by Barenboim et al. [JACM'16], Chung et al. [PODC'14], Ghaffari [SODA'16], and
Halldorsson et al. [PODC'15], we study this concept in the BEEP model for the
first time.
  By doing so, we improve over local bounds that are implicitly derived from
previous work (that uses traditional global analysis) on computing a Maximal
Independent Set in the \beep model for a large range of values of the parameter
$\Delta$. At the same time, we show that our algorithm in the \beep model only
needs to pay a $\log(1/\epsilon)$ factor in the runtime compared to the best
known MIS algorithm in the much more powerful \local model. We demonstrate that
this overhead is negligible, as communication via beeps can be implemented
using significantly less resources than communication in the LOCAL model. In
particular, when looking at implementing these models, one round of the \local
model needs at least $O(\Delta)$ time units, while one round in the BEEP model
needs $O(\log\Delta)$ time units, an improvement that diminishes the loss of a
$\log(1/\epsilon)$ factor in most settings.

 <dc:title>Lexically Constrained Decoding for Sequence Generation Using Grid Beam

 <dc:creator>Hokamp, Chris</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Qun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present Grid Beam Search (GBS), an algorithm which extends beam search to
allow the inclusion of pre-specified lexical constraints. The algorithm can be
used with any model that generates a sequence $ \mathbf{\hat{y}} =
\{y_{0}\ldots y_{T}\} $, by maximizing $ p(\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{x}) =
\prod\limits_{t}p(y_{t} | \mathbf{x}; \{y_{0} \ldots y_{t-1}\}) $. Lexical
constraints take the form of phrases or words that must be present in the
output sequence. This is a very general way to incorporate additional knowledge
into a model's output without requiring any modification of the model
parameters or training data. We demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of
Lexically Constrained Decoding by conducting experiments on Neural
Interactive-Predictive Translation, as well as Domain Adaptation for Neural
Machine Translation. Experiments show that GBS can provide large improvements
in translation quality in interactive scenarios, and that, even without any
user input, GBS can be used to achieve significant gains in performance in
domain adaptation scenarios.

 <dc:description>  With the increasing demands of applications in virtual reality such as 3D
films, virtual Human-Machine Interactions and virtual agents, the analysis of
3D human face analysis is considered to be more and more important as a
fundamental step for those virtual reality tasks. Due to information provided
by an additional dimension, 3D facial reconstruction enables aforementioned
tasks to be achieved with higher accuracy than those based on 2D facial
analysis. The denser the 3D facial model is, the more information it could
provide. However, most existing dense 3D facial reconstruction methods require
complicated processing and high system cost. To this end, this paper presents a
novel method that simplifies the process of dense 3D facial reconstruction by
employing only one frame of depth data obtained with an off-the-shelf RGB-D
sensor. The experiments showed competitive results with real world data.

 <dc:description>  Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) utilizes an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to
overcome the limitations of Visual Odometry (VO). However, the VIO for vehicles
in large-scale outdoor environments still has some difficulties in estimating
forward motion with distant features. To solve these difficulties, we propose a
robust VIO method based on the analysis of feature confidence in forward motion
estimation using an IMU. We first formulate the VIO problem by using effective
trifocal tensor geometry. Then, we infer the feature confidence by using the
motion information obtained from an IMU and incorporate the confidence into the
Bayesian estimation framework. Experimental results on the public KITTI dataset
show that the proposed VIO outperforms the baseline VIO, and it also
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed feature confidence analysis and
confidence-incorporated egomotion estimation framework.

 <dc:description>  Translation has played an important role in trade, law, commerce, politics,
and literature for thousands of years. Translators have always tried to be
invisible; ideal translations should look as if they were written originally in
the target language. We show that traces of the source language remain in the
translation product to the extent that it is possible to uncover the history of
the source language by looking only at the translation. Specifically, we
automatically reconstruct phylogenetic language trees from monolingual texts
(translated from several source languages). The signal of the source language
is so powerful that it is retained even after two phases of translation. This
strongly indicates that source language interference is the most dominant
characteristic of translated texts, overshadowing the more subtle signals of
universal properties of translation.

 <dc:description>  We present here a new model and algorithm which performs an efficient Natural
gradient descent for Multilayer Perceptrons. Natural gradient descent was
originally proposed from a point of view of information geometry, and it
performs the steepest descent updates on manifolds in a Riemannian space. In
particular, we extend an approach taken by the &quot;Whitened neural networks&quot;
model. We make the whitening process not only in feed-forward direction as in
the original model, but also in the back-propagation phase. Its efficacy is
shown by an application of this &quot;Bidirectional whitened neural networks&quot; model
to a handwritten character recognition data (MNIST data).

 <dc:description>  This paper positively solves an open problem if it is possible to provide a
Hilbert system to Epistemic Logic of Friendship (EFL) by Seligman, Girard and
Liu. To find a Hilbert system, we first introduce a sound, complete and
cut-free tree (or nested) sequent calculus for EFL, which is an integrated
combination of Seligman's sequent calculus for basic hybrid logic and a tree
sequent calculus for modal logic. Then we translate a tree sequent into an
ordinary formula to specify a Hilbert system of EFL and finally show that our
Hilbert system is sound and complete for the intended two-dimensional
semantics.

 <dc:description>  -Multipath communications at the Internet scale have been a myth for a long
time, with no actual protocol being deployed so that multiple paths could be
taken by a same connection on the way towards an Internet destination.
Recently, the Multipath Transport Control Protocol (MPTCP) extension was
standardized and is undergoing a quick adoption in many use-cases, from mobile
to fixed access networks, from data-centers to core networks. Among its major
benefits -- i.e., reliability thanks to backup path rerouting; throughput
increase thanks to link aggregation; and confidentiality thanks to harder
capacity to intercept a full connection -- the latter has attracted lower
attention. How interesting would it be using MPTCP to exploit multiple
Internet-scale paths hence decreasing the probability of man-in-the-middle
(MITM) attacks is a question to which we try to answer. By analyzing the
Autonomous System (AS) level graph, we identify which countries and regions
show a higher level of robustness against MITM AS-level attacks, for example
due to core cable tapping or route hijacking practices.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a new model of spatial random multiple access systems with a
non-standard departure policy: all arriving messages are distributed uniformly
on a finite sphere in the space, and when a successful transmission of a single
message occurs, the transmitted message leaves the system together with all its
neighbours within a ball of a given radius centred at the message's location.
We consider three classes of protocols: centralised protocols and decentralised
protocols with either ternary or binary feedback; and analyse their stability.
Further, we discuss some asymptotic properties of stable protocols.

learning to predict surrounding words for every word in the dataset. This
language modeling objective incentivises the system to learn general-purpose
patterns of semantic and syntactic composition, which are also useful for
improving accuracy on different sequence labeling tasks. The architecture was
evaluated on a range of datasets, covering the tasks of error detection in
learner texts, named entity recognition, chunking and POS-tagging. The novel
language modeling objective provided consistent performance improvements on
every benchmark, without requiring any additional annotated or unannotated
data.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new graph-based approach that induces synsets using
synonymy dictionaries and word embeddings. First, we build a weighted graph of
synonyms extracted from commonly available resources, such as Wiktionary.
Second, we apply word sense induction to deal with ambiguous words. Finally, we
cluster the disambiguated version of the ambiguous input graph into synsets.
Our meta-clustering approach lets us use an efficient hard clustering algorithm
to perform a fuzzy clustering of the graph. Despite its simplicity, our
approach shows excellent results, outperforming five competitive
state-of-the-art methods in terms of F-score on three gold standard datasets
for English and Russian derived from large-scale manually constructed lexical
resources.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of autonomous multi-agent cooperative target
search in an unknown environment using a decentralized framework under a
no-communication scenario. The targets are considered as static targets and the
agents are considered to be homogeneous. The no-communication scenario
translates as the agents do not exchange either the information about the
environment or their actions among themselves. We propose an integrated
decision and control theoretic solution for a search problem which generates
feasible agent trajectories. In particular, a perception based algorithm is
proposed which allows an agent to estimate the probable strategies of other
agents' and to choose a decision based on such estimation. The algorithm shows
robustness with respect to the estimation accuracy to a certain degree. The
performance of the algorithm is compared with random strategies and numerical
simulation shows considerable advantages.

 <dc:description>  Three dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) have been
established as a powerful tool to simultaneously learn features from both
spatial and temporal dimensions, which is suitable to be applied to video-based
action recognition. In this work, we propose not to directly use the
activations of fully-connected layers of a 3D CNN as the video feature, but to
use selective convolutional layer activations to form a discriminative
descriptor for video. It pools the feature on the convolutional layers under
the guidance of body joint positions. Two schemes of mapping body joints into
convolutional feature maps for pooling are discussed. The body joint positions
can be obtained from any off-the-shelf skeleton estimation algorithm. The
helpfulness of the body joint guided feature pooling with inaccurate skeleton
estimation is systematically evaluated. To make it end-to-end and do not rely
on any sophisticated body joint detection algorithm, we further propose a
two-stream bilinear model which can learn the guidance from the body joints and
capture the spatio-temporal features simultaneously. In this model, the body
joint guided feature pooling is conveniently formulated as a bilinear product
operation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of body joint guided pooling which achieves promising
performance.

 <dc:description>  In the paper, we make an investigation of robust beamforming for secure
directional modulation in the multi-user multiple-input and multiple output
(MU-MIMO) systems in the presence of direction angle measurement errors. When
statistical knowledge of direction angle measurement errors is unavailable, a
novel robust beamforming scheme of combining main-lobe-integration (MLI) and
leakage is proposed to simultaneously transmit multiple different independent
parallel confidential message streams to the associated multiple distinct
desired users. The proposed scheme includes two steps: designing the
beamforming vectors of the useful confidential messages and constructing
artificial noise (AN) projection matrix. Here, in its first step, the
beamforming vectors for the useful confidential messages of desired user k are
given by minimizing the useful signal power leakage from main-lobe of desired
user k to the sum of main-lobes of the remaining desired directions plus
main-lobes of all eavesdropper directions. In its second step, the AN
projection matrix is constructed by simultaneously maximizing the AN power
leakage to all eavesdropper directions such that all eavesdroppers are
disrupted seriously, where AN is viewed by the transmitter as a useful signal
for eavedroppers. Due to independent beamforming vectors for different desired
users, a more secure transmission is achieved. Compared with conventional
non-robust methods, the proposed method can provide a significant improvement
in bit error rate along the desired directions and secrecy-sum-rate towards
multiple desired users without needing statistical property or distribution of
angle measurement errors.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Rolling Shutter (RS) cameras have become popularized because of low-cost
imaging capability. However, the RS cameras suffer from undesirable artifacts
when the camera or the subject is moving, or illumination condition changes.
For that reason, Monocular Visual Odometry (MVO) with RS cameras produces
inaccurate ego-motion estimates. Previous works solve this RS distortion
problem with motion prediction from images and/or inertial sensors. However,
the MVO still has trouble in handling the RS distortion when the camera motion
changes abruptly (e.g. vibration of mobile cameras causes extremely fast motion
instantaneously). To address the problem, we propose the novel MVO algorithm in
consideration of the geometric characteristics of RS cameras. The key idea of
the proposed algorithm is the new RS essential matrix which incorporates the
instantaneous angular and linear velocities at each frame. Our algorithm
produces accurate and robust ego-motion estimates in an online manner, and is
applicable to various mobile applications with RS cameras. The superiority of
the proposed algorithm is validated through quantitative and qualitative
comparison on both synthetic and real dataset.

 <dc:description>  Dynamic Networks are a popular way of modeling and studying the behavior of
evolving systems. However, their analysis constitutes a relatively recent
subfield of Network Science, and the number of available tools is consequently
much smaller than for static networks. In this work, we propose a method
specifically designed to take advantage of the longitudinal nature of dynamic
networks. It characterizes each individual node by studying the evolution of
its direct neighborhood, based on the assumption that the way this neighborhood
changes reflects the role and position of the node in the whole network. For
this purpose, we define the concept of \textit{neighborhood event}, which
corresponds to the various transformations such groups of nodes can undergo,
and describe an algorithm for detecting such events. We demonstrate the
interest of our method on three real-world networks: DBLP, LastFM and Enron. We
apply frequent pattern mining to extract meaningful information from temporal
sequences of neighborhood events. This results in the identification of
behavioral trends emerging in the whole network, as well as the individual
characterization of specific nodes. We also perform a cluster analysis, which
reveals that, in all three networks, one can distinguish two types of nodes
exhibiting different behaviors: a very small group of active nodes, whose
neighborhood undergo diverse and frequent events, and a very large group of
stable nodes.

 <dc:description>  Weighted labelled transition systems (WLTSs) are an established meta-model
aiming to provide general results and tools for a wide range of systems such as
non-deterministic, stochastic, and probabilistic systems. In order to encompass
processes combining several quantitative aspects, extensions of the WLTS
framework have been further proposed, state-to-function transition systems
(FuTSs) and uniform labelled transition systems (ULTraSs) being two prominent
examples. In this paper we show that this hierarchy of meta-models collapses
when studied under the lens of bisimulation-coherent encodings. Taking
advantage of these reductions, we derive a fully abstract Hennessy-Milner-style
logic for FuTSs, i.e., which characterizes quantitative bisimilarity, from a
fully-abstract logic for WLTSs.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic Constraint Programming (SCP) is an extension of Constraint
Programming (CP) used for modelling and solving problems involving constraints
and uncertainty. SCP inherits excellent modelling abilities and filtering
algorithms from CP, but so far it has not been applied to large problems.
Reinforcement Learning (RL) extends Dynamic Programming to large stochastic
problems, but is problem-specific and has no generic solvers. We propose a
hybrid combining the scalability of RL with the modelling and constraint
filtering methods of CP. We implement a prototype in a CP system and
demonstrate its usefulness on SCP problems.

 <dc:description>  Various methods have been proposed for creating and maintaining lists of
potentially filtered URLs to allow for measurement of ongoing internet
censorship around the world. Whilst testing a known resource for evidence of
filtering can be relatively simple, given appropriate vantage points,
discovering previously unknown filtered web resources remains an open
challenge.
  We present a new framework for automating the process of discovering filtered
resources through the use of adaptive queries to well-known search engines. Our
system applies information retrieval algorithms to isolate characteristic
linguistic patterns in known filtered web pages; these are then used as the
basis for web search queries. The results of these queries are then checked for
evidence of filtering, and newly discovered filtered resources are fed back
into the system to detect further filtered content.
  Our implementation of this framework, applied to China as a case study, shows
that this approach is demonstrably effective at detecting significant numbers
of previously unknown filtered web pages, making a significant contribution to
the ongoing detection of internet filtering as it develops.
  Our tool is currently deployed and has been used to discover 1355 domains
that are poisoned within China as of Feb 2017 - 30 times more than are
contained in the most widely-used public filter list. Of these, 759 are outside
of the Alexa Top 1000 domains list, demonstrating the capability of this
framework to find more obscure filtered content. Further, our initial analysis
of filtered URLs, and the search terms that were used to discover them, gives
further insight into the nature of the content currently being blocked in
China.

 <dc:description>  Efficiency of single-objective optimization can be improved by introducing
some auxiliary objectives. Ideally, auxiliary objectives should be helpful.
However, in practice, objectives may be efficient on some optimization stages
but obstructive on others. In this paper we propose a modification of the EA+RL
method which dynamically selects optimized objectives using reinforcement
learning. The proposed modification prevents from losing the best found
solution. We analysed the proposed modification and compared it with the EA+RL
method and Random Local Search on XdivK, Generalized OneMax and LeadingOnes
problems. The proposed modification outperforms the EA+RL method on all problem
instances. It also outperforms the single objective approach on the most
problem instances. We also provide detailed analysis of how different
components of the considered algorithms influence efficiency of optimization.
In addition, we present theoretical analysis of the proposed modification on
the XdivK problem.

 <dc:description>  Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) communications are considered for the
fifth-generation (5G) small-cell networks as a tool to improve the high data
rates and the cell-edge throughput. The average achievable rates of the
small-cell base stations (SBS) cooperation strategies with distance and
received signal power constraints are respectively derived for the fractal
small-cell networks based on the anisotropic path loss model. Simulation
results are presented to show that the average achievable rate with the
received signal power constraint is larger than the rate with a distance
constraint considering the same number of cooperative SBSs. The average
achievable rate with distance constraint decreases with the increase of the
intensity of SBSs when the anisotropic path loss model is considered. What's
more, the network energy efficiency of fractal smallcell networks adopting the
SBS cooperation strategy with the received signal power constraint is analyzed.
The network energy efficiency decreases with the increase of the intensity of
SBSs which indicates a challenge on the deployment design for fractal
small-cell networks.

 <dc:description>  Concurrent Kleene Algebra (CKA) is a mathematical formalism to study programs
that exhibit concurrent behaviour. As with previous extensions of Kleene
Algebra, characterizing the free model is crucial in order to develop the
foundations of the theory and potential applications. For CKA, this has been an
open question for a few years and this paper makes an important step towards an
answer. We present a new automaton model and a Kleene-like theorem that relates
a relaxed version of CKA to series-parallel pomset languages, which are a
natural candidate for the free model. There are two substantial differences
with previous work: from expressions to automata, we use Brzozowski
derivatives, which enable a direct construction of the automaton; from automata
to expressions, we provide a syntactic characterization of the automata that
denote valid CKA behaviours.

 <dc:title>Synchronization with Guaranteed Clock Continuity using Pulse-Coupled
  Oscillators</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Clock synchronization is a widely discussed topic in the engineering
literature. Ensuring that individual clocks are closely aligned is important in
network systems, since the correct timing of various events in a network is
usually necessary for proper system implementation. However, many existing
clock synchronization algorithms update clock values abruptly, resulting in
discontinuous clocks which have been shown to lead to undesirable behavior. In
this paper, we propose using the pulse-coupled oscillator model to guarantee
clock continuity, demonstrating two general methods for achieving continuous
phase evolution in any pulse-coupled oscillator network. We provide rigorous
mathematical proof that the pulse-coupled oscillator algorithm is able to
converge to the synchronized state when the phase continuity methods are
applied. We provide simulation results supporting these proofs. We further
investigate the convergence behavior of other pulse-coupled oscillator
synchronization algorithms using the proposed methods.

 <dc:description>  Argument mining has become a popular research area in NLP. It typically
includes the identification of argumentative components, e.g. claims, as the
central component of an argument. We perform a qualitative analysis across six
different datasets and show that these appear to conceptualize claims quite
differently. To learn about the consequences of such different
conceptualizations of claim for practical applications, we carried out
extensive experiments using state-of-the-art feature-rich and deep learning
systems, to identify claims in a cross-domain fashion. While the divergent
perception of claims in different datasets is indeed harmful to cross-domain
classification, we show that there are shared properties on the lexical level
as well as system configurations that can help to overcome these gaps.

 <dc:description>  Computational prediction of membrane protein (MP) structures is very
challenging partially due to lack of sufficient solved structures for homology
modeling. Recently direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA) sheds some light
on protein contact prediction and accordingly, contact-assisted folding, but
DCA is effective only on some very large-sized families since it uses
information only in a single protein family. This paper presents a deep
transfer learning method that can significantly improve MP contact prediction
by learning contact patterns and complex sequence-contact relationship from
thousands of non-membrane proteins (non-MPs). Tested on 510 non-redundant MPs,
our deep model (learned from only non-MPs) has top L/10 long-range contact
prediction accuracy 0.69, better than our deep model trained by only MPs (0.63)
and much better than a representative DCA method CCMpred (0.47) and the CASP11
winner MetaPSICOV (0.55). The accuracy of our deep model can be further
improved to 0.72 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs. When only contacts
in transmembrane regions are evaluated, our method has top L/10 long-range
accuracy 0.62, 0.57, and 0.53 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, by
non-MPs only, and by MPs only, respectively, still much better than MetaPSICOV
(0.45) and CCMpred (0.40). All these results suggest that sequence-structure
relationship learned by our deep model from non-MPs generalizes well to MP
contact prediction. Improved contact prediction also leads to better
contact-assisted folding. Using only top predicted contacts as restraints, our
deep learning method can fold 160 and 200 of 510 MPs with TMscore&gt;0.6 when
trained by non-MPs only and by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, respectively, while
CCMpred and MetaPSICOV can do so for only 56 and 77 MPs, respectively. Our
contact-assisted folding also greatly outperforms homology modeling.

 <dc:title>The Structure of One Weight Linear and Cyclic Codes Over Z2^r x

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Inspired by the Z2Z4-additive codes, linear codes over Z2^r x(Z2+uZ2)^s have
been introduced by Aydogdu et al. more recently. Although these family of codes
are similar to each other, linear codes over Z2^r x(Z2+uZ2)^s have some
advantages compared to Z2Z4-additive codes. A code is called constant
weight(one weight) if all the codewords have the same weight. It is well known
that constant weight or one weight codes have many important applications. In
this paper, we study the structure of one weight Z2Z2[u]-linear and cyclic
codes. We classify these type of one weight codes and also give some
illustrative examples.

 <dc:description>  Research on vehicular networking (V2X) security has produced a range of
security mechanisms and protocols tailored for this domain, addressing both
security and privacy. Typically, the security analysis of these proposals has
largely been informal. However, formal analysis can be used to expose flaws and
ultimately provide a higher level of assurance in the protocols.
  This paper focusses on the formal analysis of a particular element of
security mechanisms for V2X found in many proposals: the revocation of
malicious or misbehaving vehicles from the V2X system by invalidating their
credentials. This revocation needs to be performed in an unlinkable way for
vehicle privacy even in the context of vehicles regularly changing their
pseudonyms. The REWIRE scheme by Forster et al. and its subschemes BASIC and
RTOKEN aim to solve this challenge by means of cryptographic solutions and
trusted hardware.
  Formal analysis using the TAMARIN prover identifies two flaws with some of
the functional correctness and authentication properties in these schemes. We
then propose Obscure Token (OTOKEN), an extension of REWIRE to enable
revocation in a privacy preserving manner. Our approach addresses the
functional and authentication properties by introducing an additional key-pair,
which offers a stronger and verifiable guarantee of successful revocation of
vehicles without resolving the long-term identity. Moreover OTOKEN is the first
V2X revocation protocol to be co-designed with a formal model.

 <dc:description>  With the emerging of the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication systems,
millimeter wave transmissions are believed to be a promising solution for
vehicular networks, especially in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications. In
millimeter wave V2V communications, different vehicular networking services
have different quality requirements for V2V multi-hop links. To evaluate the
quality of different V2V wireless links, a new link quality indicator is
proposed in this paper considering requirements of the real-time and the
reliability in V2V multi-hop links. Moreover, different weight factors are
configured to reflect the different requirements of different types of services
on real-time and reliability in the new quality indicator. Based on the
proposed link quality indicator, the relationship between V2V link quality and
one-hop communication distance under different vehicle densities is analyzed in
this paper. Simulation results indicate that the link quality is improved with
the increasing of vehicle density and there exists an optimal one-hop
communication distance for the link quality when the vehicle density is fixed.

Determining rumour veracity and support for rumours (SemEval 2017 Task 8,
Subtask A). Subtask A addresses the challenge of rumour stance classification,
which involves identifying the attitude of Twitter users towards the
truthfulness of the rumour they are discussing. Stance classification is
considered to be an important step towards rumour verification, therefore
performing well in this task is expected to be useful in debunking false
rumours. In this work we classify a set of Twitter posts discussing rumours
into either supporting, denying, questioning or commenting on the underlying
rumours. We propose a LSTM-based sequential model that, through modelling the
conversational structure of tweets, which achieves an accuracy of 0.784 on the
RumourEval test set outperforming all other systems in Subtask A.

 <dc:description>  The scalable calculation of matrix determinants has been a bottleneck to the
widespread application of many machine learning methods such as determinantal
point processes, Gaussian processes, generalised Markov random fields, graph
models and many others. In this work, we estimate log determinants under the
framework of maximum entropy, given information in the form of moment
constraints from stochastic trace estimation. The estimates demonstrate a
significant improvement on state-of-the-art alternative methods, as shown on a
wide variety of UFL sparse matrices. By taking the example of a general Markov
random field, we also demonstrate how this approach can significantly
accelerate inference in large-scale learning methods involving the log
determinant.

 <dc:description>  When tracking user-specific online activities, each user's preference is
revealed in the form of choices and comparisons. For example, a user's purchase
history tracks her choices, i.e. which item was chosen among a subset of
offerings. A user's comparisons are observed either explicitly as in movie
ratings or implicitly as in viewing times of news articles. Given such
individualized ordinal data, we address the problem of collaboratively learning
representations of the users and the items. The learned features can be used to
predict a user's preference of an unseen item to be used in recommendation
systems. This also allows one to compute similarities among users and items to
be used for categorization and search. Motivated by the empirical successes of
the MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model in marketing and transportation, and also
more recent successes in word embedding and crowdsourced image embedding, we
pose this problem as learning the MNL model parameters that best explains the
data. We propose a convex optimization for learning the MNL model, and show
that it is minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor by comparing its
performance to a fundamental lower bound. This characterizes the minimax sample
complexity of the problem, and proves that the proposed estimator cannot be
improved upon other than by a logarithmic factor. Further, the analysis
identifies how the accuracy depends on the topology of sampling via the
spectrum of the sampling graph. This provides a guideline for designing surveys
when one can choose which items are to be compared. This is accompanies by
numerical simulations on synthetic and real datasets confirming our theoretical
predictions.

 <dc:description>  Distributed actor languages are an effective means of constructing scalable
reliable systems, and the Erlang programming language has a well-established
and influential model. While Erlang model conceptually provides reliable
scalability, it has some inherent scalability limits and these force developers
to depart from the model at scale. This article establishes the scalability
limits of Erlang systems, and reports the work to improve the language
scalability.
  We systematically study the scalability limits of Erlang and address the
issues at the virtual machine (VM), language, and tool levels. More
specifically: (1) We have evolved the Erlang VM so that it can work effectively
in large scale single-host multicore and NUMA architectures. We have made
important architectural improvements to the Erlang/OTP. (2) We have designed
and implemented Scalable Distributed (SD) Erlang libraries to address
language-level scalability issues, and provided and validated a set of
semantics for the new language constructs. (3) To make large Erlang systems
easier to deploy, monitor, and debug we have developed and made open source
releases of five complementary tools, some specific to SD Erlang.
  Throughout the article we use two case studies to investigate the
capabilities of our new technologies and tools: a distributed hash table based
Orbit calculation and Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO). Chaos Monkey experiments
show that two versions of ACO survive random process failure and hence that SD
Erlang preserves the Erlang reliability model. Even for programs with no global
recovery data to maintain, SD Erlang partitions the network to reduce network
traffic and hence improves performance of the Orbit and ACO benchmarks above 80
hosts. ACO measurements show that maintaining global recovery data dramatically
limits scalability; however scalability is recovered by partitioning the
recovery data.

 <dc:title>Post-Quantum Cryptography: S381 Cyclic Subgroup of High Order</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hecht, Pedro</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>94A60</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Currently there is an active Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) solutions
search, which attempts to find cryptographic protocols resistant to attacks by
means of for instance Shor polynomial time algorithm for numerical field
problems like integer factorization (IFP) or the discrete logarithm (DLP). The
use of non-commutative or non-associative structures are, among others, valid
choices for these kinds of protocols. In our case, we focus on a permutation
subgroup of high order and belonging to the symmetric group S381. Using
adequate one-way functions (OWF), we derived a Diffie-Hellman key exchange and
an ElGamal ciphering procedure that only relies on combinatorial operations.
Both OWF pose hard search problems which are assumed as not belonging to BQP
time-complexity class. Obvious advantages of present protocols are their
conceptual simplicity, fast throughput implementations, high cryptanalytic
security and no need for arithmetic operations and therefore extended precision
libraries. Such features make them suitable for low performance and low power
consumption platforms like smart cards, USB-keys and cellphones.

 <dc:title>Automatic Liver Lesion Segmentation Using A Deep Convolutional Neural

 <dc:description>  Liver lesion segmentation is an important step for liver cancer diagnosis,
treatment planning and treatment evaluation. LiTS (Liver Tumor Segmentation
Challenge) provides a common testbed for comparing different automatic liver
lesion segmentation methods. We participate in this challenge by developing a
deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) method. The particular DCNN model
works in 2.5D in that it takes a stack of adjacent slices as input and produces
the segmentation map corresponding to the center slice. The model has 32 layers
in total and makes use of both long range concatenation connections of U-Net
[1] and short-range residual connections from ResNet [2]. The model was trained
using the 130 LiTS training datasets and achieved an average Dice score of 0.67
when evaluated on the 70 test CT scans, which ranked first for the LiTS
challenge at the time of the ISBI 2017 conference.

 <dc:title>Supervised Adversarial Networks for Image Saliency Detection</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pan, Hengyue</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Jiang, Hui</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the past few years, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) became a
prevalent research topic. By defining two convolutional neural networks
(G-Network and D-Network) and introducing an adversarial procedure between them
during the training process, GAN has ability to generate good quality images
that look like natural images from a random vector. Besides image generation,
GAN may have potential to deal with wide range of real world problems. In this
paper, we follow the basic idea of GAN and propose a novel model for image
saliency detection, which is called Supervised Adversarial Networks (SAN).
Specifically, SAN also trains two models simultaneously: the G-Network takes
natural images as inputs and generates corresponding saliency maps (synthetic
saliency maps), and the D-Network is trained to determine whether one sample is
a synthetic saliency map or ground-truth saliency map. However, different from
GAN, the proposed method uses fully supervised learning to learn both G-Network
and D-Network by applying class labels of the training set. Moreover, a novel
kind of layer call conv-comparison layer is introduced into the D-Network to
further improve the saliency performance by forcing the high-level feature of
synthetic saliency maps and ground-truthes as similar as possible. Experimental
results on Pascal VOC 2012 database show that the SAN model can generate high
quality saliency maps for many complicate natural images.

 <dc:title>Fast PET reconstruction using Multi-scale Fully Convolutional Neural
  Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jiao, Jieqing</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ourselin, Sebastien</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Reconstruction of PET images is an ill-posed inverse problem and often
requires iterative algorithms to achieve good image quality for reliable
clinical use in practice, at huge computational costs. In this paper, we
consider the PET reconstruction a dense prediction problem where the large
scale contextual information is essential, and propose a novel architecture of
multi-scale fully convolutional neural networks (msfCNN) for fast PET image
reconstruction. The proposed msfCNN gains large receptive fields with both
memory and computational efficiency, by using a downscaling-upscaling structure
and dilated convolutions. Instead of pooling and deconvolution, we propose to
use the periodic shuffling operation from sub-pixel convolution and its inverse
to scale the size of feature maps without losing resolution. Residual
connections were added to improve training. We trained the proposed msfCNN
model with simulated data, and applied it to clinical PET data acquired on a
Siemens mMR scanner. The results from real oncological and neurodegenerative
cases show that the proposed msfCNN-based reconstruction outperforms the
iterative approaches in terms of computational time while achieving comparable
image quality for quantification. The proposed msfCNN model can be applied to
other dense prediction tasks, and fast msfCNN-based PET reconstruction could
facilitate the potential use of molecular imaging in interventional/surgical
procedures, where cancer surgery can particularly benefit.

 <dc:description>  Disjoint-Set forests, consisting of Union-Find trees, are data structures
having a widespread practical application due to their efficiency. Despite them
being well-known, no exact structural characterization of these trees is known
(such a characterization exists for Union trees which are constructed without
using path compression) for the case assuming union-by-rank strategy for
merging. In this paper we provide such a characterization by means of a simple
push operation and show that the decision problem whether a given tree (along
with the rank info of its nodes) is a Union-Find tree is NP-complete,
complementing our earlier similar result for the union-by-size strategy.

 <dc:description>  Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) is a learning methodology where a peer-leader
co-ordinate a small-group of students to collaboratively solve technical
problems. PLTL have been adopted for various science, engineering, technology
and maths courses in several US universities. This paper proposed and evaluated
a speech system for behavioral analysis of PLTL groups. It could help in
identifying the best practices for PLTL. The CRSS-PLTL corpus was used for
evaluation of developed algorithms. In this paper, we developed a robust speech
activity detection (SAD) by fusing the outputs of a DNN-based pitch extractor
and an unsupervised SAD based on voicing measures. Robust speaker diarization
system consisted of bottleneck features (from stacked autoencoder) and informed
HMM-based joint segmentation and clustering system. Behavioral characteristics
such as participation, dominance, emphasis, curiosity and engagement were
extracted by acoustic analyses of speech segments belonging to all students. We
proposed a novel method for detecting question inflection and performed equal
error rate analysis on PLTL corpus. In addition, a robust approach for
detecting emphasized speech regions was also proposed. Further, we performed
exploratory data analysis for understanding the distortion present in CRSS-PLTL
corpus as it was collected in naturalistic scenario. The ground-truth Likert
scale ratings were used for capturing the team dynamics in terms of student's
responses to a variety of evaluation questions. Results suggested the
applicability of proposed system for behavioral analysis of small-group
conversations such as PLTL, work-place meetings etc.. Keywords- Behavioral

 <dc:description>  We give algorithms with running time $2^{O({\sqrt{k}\log{k}})} \cdot
n^{O(1)}$ for the following problems. Given an $n$-vertex unit disk graph $G$
and an integer $k$, decide whether $G$ contains (1) a path on exactly/at least
$k$ vertices, (2) a cycle on exactly $k$ vertices, (3) a cycle on at least $k$
vertices, (4) a feedback vertex set of size at most $k$, and (5) a set of $k$
pairwise vertex-disjoint cycles. For the first three problems, no
subexponential time parameterized algorithms were previously known. For the
remaining two problems, our algorithms significantly outperform the previously
best known parameterized algorithms that run in time $2^{O(k^{0.75}\log{k})}
\cdot n^{O(1)}$. Our algorithms are based on a new kind of tree decompositions
of unit disk graphs where the separators can have size up to $k^{O(1)}$ and
there exists a solution that crosses every separator at most $O(\sqrt{k})$
times. The running times of our algorithms are optimal up to the $\log{k}$
factor in the exponent, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis.

 <dc:description>  For a fixed collection of graphs ${\cal F}$, the ${\cal F}$-M-DELETION
problem consists in, given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, decide whether there
exists $S \subseteq V(G)$ with $|S| \leq k$ such that $G \setminus S$ does not
contain any of the graphs in ${\cal F}$ as a minor. We are interested in the
parameterized complexity of ${\cal F}$-M-DELETION when the parameter is the
treewidth of $G$, denoted by $tw$. Our objective is to determine, for a fixed
${\cal F}$, the smallest function $f_{{\cal F}}$ such that ${\cal
F}$-M-DELETION can be solved in time $f_{{\cal F}}(tw) \cdot n^{O(1)}$ on
$n$-vertex graphs. Using and enhancing the machinery of boundaried graphs and
small sets of representatives introduced by Bodlaender et al. [J ACM, 2016], we
prove that when all the graphs in ${\cal F}$ are connected and at least one of
them is planar, then $f_{{\cal F}}(w) = 2^{O (w \cdot\log w)}$. When ${\cal F}$
is a singleton containing a clique, a cycle, or a path on $i$ vertices, we
prove the following asymptotically tight bounds:
  $\bullet$ $f_{\{K_4\}}(w) = 2^{\Theta (w \cdot \log w)}$.
  $\bullet$ $f_{\{C_i\}}(w) = 2^{\Theta (w)}$ for every $i \leq 4$, and
$f_{\{C_i\}}(w) = 2^{\Theta (w \cdot\log w)}$ for every $i \geq 5$.
  $\bullet$ $f_{\{P_i\}}(w) = 2^{\Theta (w)}$ for every $i \leq 4$, and
$f_{\{P_i\}}(w) = 2^{\Theta (w \cdot \log w)}$ for every $i \geq 6$.
  The lower bounds hold unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, and the
superexponential ones are inspired by a reduction of Marcin Pilipczuk [Discrete
Appl Math, 2016]. The single-exponential algorithms use, in particular, the
rank-based approach introduced by Bodlaender et al. [Inform Comput, 2015]. We
also consider the version of the problem where the graphs in ${\cal F}$ are
forbidden as topological minors, and prove that essentially the same set of
results holds.

 <dc:title>Analytical and simplified models for dynamic analysis of sort skew
  ridges under moving loads</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nguyen, K.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Skew bridges are common in highways and railway lines when non perpendicular
crossings are encountered. The structural effect of skewness is an additional
torsion on the bridge deck which may have a considerable effect, making its
analysis and design more complex. In this paper, an analytical model following
3D beam theory is firstly derived in order to evaluate the dynamic response of
skew bridges under moving loads. Following, a simplified 2D model is also
considered which includes only vertical beam bending. The natural frequencies,
eigenmodes and orthogonality relationships are determined from the boundary
conditions. The dynamic response is determined in time domain by using the
&quot;exact'&quot; integration. Both models are validated through some numerical examples
by comparing with the results obtained by 3D FE models. A parametric study is
performed with the simplified model in order to identify parameters that
significantly influence the vertical dynamic response of the skew bridge under
traffic loads. The results show that the grade of skewness has an important
influence on the vertical displacement, but hardly on the vertical acceleration
of the bridge. The torsional stiffness really has effect on the vertical
displacement when the skew angle is large. The span length reduces the skewness
effect on the dynamic behavior of the skew bridge.

 <dc:description>  In conversational speech, the acoustic signal provides cues that help
listeners disambiguate difficult parses. For automatically parsing a spoken
utterance, we introduce a model that integrates transcribed text and
acoustic-prosodic features using a convolutional neural network over energy and
pitch trajectories coupled with an attention-based recurrent neural network
that accepts text and word-based prosodic features. We find that different
types of acoustic-prosodic features are individually helpful, and together
improve parse F1 scores significantly over a strong text-only baseline. For
this study with known sentence boundaries, error analysis shows that the main
benefit of acoustic-prosodic features is in sentences with disfluencies and
that attachment errors are most improved.

 <dc:description>  The accuracy of object detectors and trackers is most commonly evaluated by
the Intersection over Union (IoU) criterion. To date, most approaches are
restricted to axis-aligned or oriented boxes and, as a consequence, many
datasets are only labeled with boxes. Nevertheless, axis-aligned or oriented
boxes cannot accurately capture an object's shape. To address this, a number of
densely segmented datasets has started to emerge in both the object detection
and the object tracking communities. However, evaluating the accuracy of object
detectors and trackers that are restricted to boxes on densely segmented data
is not straightforward. To close this gap, we introduce the relative
Intersection over Union (rIoU) accuracy measure. The measure normalizes the IoU
with the optimal box for the segmentation to generate an accuracy measure that
ranges between 0 and 1 and allows a more precise measurement of accuracies.
Furthermore, it enables an efficient and easy way to understand scenes and the
strengths and weaknesses of an object detection or tracking approach. We
display how the new measure can be efficiently calculated and present an
easy-to-use evaluation framework. The framework is tested on the DAVIS and the
VOT2016 segmentations and has been made available to the community.

 <dc:title>A Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition and Human-Computer Interaction
  System</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Xu, Pei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this project, we design a real-time human-computer interaction system
based on hand gesture. The whole system consists of three components: hand
detection, gesture recognition and human-computer interaction (HCI) based on
recognition; and realizes the robust control of mouse and keyboard events with
a higher accuracy of gesture recognition. Specifically, we use the
convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize gestures and makes it
attainable to identify relatively complex gestures using only one cheap
monocular camera. We introduce the Kalman filter to estimate the hand position
based on which the mouse cursor control is realized in a stable and smooth way.
During the HCI stage, we develop a simple strategy to avoid the false
recognition caused by noises - mostly transient, false gestures, and thus to
improve the reliability of interaction. The developed system is highly
extendable and can be used in human-robotic or other human-machine interaction
scenarios with more complex command formats rather than just mouse and keyboard
events.

 <dc:description>  Energy disaggregation or Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) addresses the
issue of extracting device-level energy consumption information by monitoring
the aggregated signal at one single measurement point without installing meters
on each individual device. Energy disaggregation can be formulated as a source
separation problem where the aggregated signal is expressed as linear
combination of basis vectors in a matrix factorization framework. In this
paper, an approach based on Sum-to-k constrained Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (S2K-NMF) is proposed. By imposing the sum-to-k constraint and
the non-negative constraint, S2K-NMF is able to effectively extract
perceptually meaningful sources from complex mixtures. The strength of the
proposed algorithm is demonstrated through two sets of experiments: Energy
disaggregation in a residential smart home, and HVAC components energy
monitoring in an industrial building testbed maintained at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (ORNL). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance of S2K-NMF as compared to state-of-the-art
decomposition-based disaggregation algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We initiate the study of computational entropy in the quantum setting. We
investigate to what extent the classical notions of computational entropy
generalize to the quantum setting, and whether quantum analogues of classical
theorems hold. Our main results are as follows. (1) The classical Leakage Chain
Rule for pseudoentropy can be extended to the case that the leakage information
is quantum (while the source remains classical). Specifically, if the source
has pseudoentropy at least $k$, then it has pseudoentropy at least $k-\ell$
conditioned on an $\ell$-qubit leakage. (2) As an application of the Leakage
Chain Rule, we construct the first quantum leakage-resilient stream-cipher in
the bounded-quantum-storage model, assuming the existence of a quantum-secure
pseudorandom generator. (3) We show that the general form of the classical
Dense Model Theorem (interpreted as the equivalence between two definitions of
pseudo-relative-min-entropy) does not extend to quantum states. Along the way,
we develop quantum analogues of some classical techniques (e.g. the Leakage
Simulation Lemma, which is proven by a Non-uniform Min-Max Theorem or
Boosting). On the other hand, we also identify some classical techniques (e.g.
Gap Amplification) that do not work in the quantum setting. Moreover, we
introduce a variety of notions that combine quantum information and quantum
complexity, and this raises several directions for future work.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: 59 pages. This version: 1. the leakage chain rule for min-entropy is
  removed. 2. the nonuniform quantum min-max is proved by MMWU method rather
  than epsilon-net. 3. The model of quantum leakage-resilient stream cipher is
  detailed. 4. Some bugs in the proof of the leakage simulation lemma by
  boosting are fixed and also a bug in the quantum min-max theorem by
  KL-projection</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the basic problem of recognizing moving objects in
video images using SP Theory of Intelligence. The concept of SP Theory of
Intelligence which is a framework of artificial intelligence, was first
introduced by Gerard J Wolff, where S stands for Simplicity and P stands for
Power. Using the concept of multiple alignment, we detect and recognize object
of our interest in video frames with multilevel hierarchical parts and
subparts, based on polythetic categories. We track the recognized objects using
the species based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). First, we extract the
multiple alignment of our object of interest from training images. In order to
recognize accurately and handle occlusion, we use the polythetic concepts on
raw data line to omit the redundant noise via searching for best alignment
representing the features from the extracted alignments. We recognize the
domain of interest from the video scenes in form of wide variety of multiple
alignments to handle scene variability. Unsupervised learning is done in the SP
model following the DONSVIC principle and natural structures are discovered via
information compression and pattern analysis. After successful recognition of
objects, we use species based PSO algorithm as the alignments of our object of
interest is analogues to observation likelihood and fitness ability of species.
Subsequently, we analyze the competition and repulsion among species with
annealed Gaussian based PSO. We have tested our algorithms on David, Walking2,
FaceOcc1, Jogging and Dudek, obtaining very satisfactory and competitive
results.

 <dc:description>  Symbolic regression is an important but challenging research topic in data
mining. It can detect the underlying mathematical models. Genetic programming
(GP) is one of the most popular methods for symbolic regression. However, its
convergence speed might be too slow for large scale problems with a large
number of variables. This drawback has become a bottleneck in practical
applications. In this paper, a new non-evolutionary real-time algorithm for
symbolic regression, Elite Bases Regression (EBR), is proposed. EBR generates a
set of candidate basis functions coded with parse-matrix in specific mapping
rules. Meanwhile, a certain number of elite bases are preserved and updated
iteratively according to the correlation coefficients with respect to the
target model. The regression model is then spanned by the elite bases. A
comparative study between EBR and a recent proposed machine learning method for
symbolic regression, Fast Function eXtraction (FFX), are conducted. Numerical
results indicate that EBR can solve symbolic regression problems more
effectively.

 <dc:description>  Monotonic surfaces spanning finite regions of $Z^d$ arise in many contexts,
including DNA-based self-assembly, card-shuffling and lozenge tilings. One
method that has been used to uniformly generate these surfaces is a Markov
chain that iteratively adds or removes a single cube below the surface during a
step. We consider a biased version of the chain, where we are more likely to
add a cube than to remove it, thereby favoring surfaces that are &quot;higher&quot; or
have more cubes below it. We prove that the chain is rapidly mixing for any
uniform bias in $Z^2$ and for bias $\lambda &gt; d$ in $Z^d$ when $d&gt;2$. In $Z^2$
we match the optimal mixing time achieved by Benjamini et al. in the context of
biased card shuffling, but using much simpler arguments. The proofs use a
geometric distance function and a variant of path coupling in order to handle
distances that can be exponentially large. We also provide the first results in
the case of fluctuating bias, where the bias can vary depending on the location
of the tile. We show that the chain continues to be rapidly mixing if the
biases are close to uniform, but that the chain can converge exponentially
slowly in the general setting.

 <dc:description>  We present an optical flow estimation approach that operates on the full
four-dimensional cost volume. This direct approach shares the structural
benefits of leading stereo matching pipelines, which are known to yield high
accuracy. To this day, such approaches have been considered impractical due to
the size of the cost volume. We show that the full four-dimensional cost volume
can be constructed in a fraction of a second due to its regularity. We then
exploit this regularity further by adapting semi-global matching to the
four-dimensional setting. This yields a pipeline that achieves significantly
higher accuracy than state-of-the-art optical flow methods while being faster
than most. Our approach outperforms all published general-purpose optical flow
methods on both Sintel and KITTI 2015 benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a trie-structured Bayesian model for unsupervised
morphological segmentation. We adopt prior information from different sources
in the model. We use neural word embeddings to discover words that are
morphologically derived from each other and thereby that are semantically
similar. We use letter successor variety counts obtained from tries that are
built by neural word embeddings. Our results show that using different
information sources such as neural word embeddings and letter successor variety
as prior information improves morphological segmentation in a Bayesian model.
Our model outperforms other unsupervised morphological segmentation models on
Turkish and gives promising results on English and German for scarce resources.

 <dc:description>  To understand the visual world, a machine must not only recognize individual
object instances but also how they interact. Humans are often at the center of
such interactions and detecting human-object interactions is an important
practical and scientific problem. In this paper, we address the task of
detecting &lt;human, verb, object&gt; triplets in challenging everyday photos. We
propose a novel model that is driven by a human-centric approach. Our
hypothesis is that the appearance of a person -- their pose, clothing, action
-- is a powerful cue for localizing the objects they are interacting with. To
exploit this cue, our model learns to predict an action-specific density over
target object locations based on the appearance of a detected person. Our model
also jointly learns to detect people and objects, and by fusing these
predictions it efficiently infers interaction triplets in a clean, jointly
trained end-to-end system we call InteractNet. We validate our approach on the
recently introduced Verbs in COCO (V-COCO) and HICO-DET datasets, where we show
quantitatively compelling results.

 <dc:description>  Simulation environments for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be very
useful for prototyping user interfaces and training personnel that will operate
UAVs in the real world. The realistic operation of such simulations will only
enhance the value of such training. In this paper, we present the integration
of a model-based waypoint navigation controller into the Reno Rescue Simulator
for the purposes of providing a more realistic user interface in simulated
environments. We also present potential uses for such simulations, even for
real-world operation of UAVs.

 <dc:title>Metropolis-Hastings Algorithms for Estimating Betweenness Centrality in

 <dc:description>  Betweenness centrality is an important index widely used in different domains
such as social networks, traffic networks and the world wide web. However, even
for mid-size networks that have only a few hundreds thousands vertices, it is
computationally expensive to compute exact betweenness scores. Therefore in
recent years, several approximate algorithms have been developed. In this
paper, first given a network $G$ and a vertex $r \in V(G)$, we propose a
Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm that samples from the space $V(G)$ and
estimates betweenness score of $r$. The stationary distribution of our MCMC
sampler is the optimal sampling proposed for betweenness centrality estimation.
We show that our MCMC sampler provides an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-approximation,
where the number of required samples depends on the position of $r$ in $G$ and
in many cases, it is a constant. Then, given a network $G$ and a set $R \subset
V(G)$, we present a Metropolis-Hastings MCMC sampler that samples from the
joint space $R$ and $V(G)$ and estimates relative betweenness scores of the
vertices in $R$. We show that for any pair $r_i, r_j \in R$, the ratio of the
expected values of the estimated relative betweenness scores of $r_i$ and $r_j$
respect to each other is equal to the ratio of their betweenness scores. We
also show that our joint-space MCMC sampler provides an
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-approximation of the relative betweenness score of $r_i$
respect to $r_j$, where the number of required samples depends on the position
of $r_j$ in $G$ and in many cases, it is a constant.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel optimization framework for learning a low-rank matrix
which is also constrained to lie in a linear subspace. Exploiting the duality
theory, we present a factorization that decouples the low-rank and structural
constraints onto separate factors. The optimization problem is formulated on
the Riemannian spectrahedron manifold, where the Riemannian framework allows to
develop computationally efficient conjugate gradient and trust-region
algorithms. Our approach easily accommodates popular non-smooth loss functions,
e.g., L1-loss, and our algorithms are scalable to large-scale problem
instances. The numerical comparisons show that our algorithms outperform
state-of-the-art in standard, robust, and non-negative matrix completion,
Hankel matrix learning, and multi-task feature learning problems on various
benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Efficient Nearest Neighbor (NN) search in high-dimensional spaces is a
foundation of many multimedia retrieval systems. Because it offers low
responses times, Product Quantization (PQ) is a popular solution. PQ compresses
high-dimensional vectors into short codes using several sub-quantizers, which
enables in-RAM storage of large databases. This allows fast answers to NN
queries, without accessing the SSD or HDD. The key feature of PQ is that it can
compute distances between short codes and high-dimensional vectors using
cache-resident lookup tables. The efficiency of this technique, named
Asymmetric Distance Computation (ADC), remains limited because it performs many
cache accesses.
  In this paper, we introduce Quick ADC, a novel technique that achieves a 3 to
6 times speedup over ADC by exploiting Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
units available in current CPUs. Efficiently exploiting SIMD requires
algorithmic changes to the ADC procedure. Namely, Quick ADC relies on two key
modifications of ADC: (i) the use 4-bit sub-quantizers instead of the standard
8-bit sub-quantizers and (ii) the quantization of floating-point distances.
This allows Quick ADC to exceed the performance of state-of-the-art systems,
e.g., it achieves a Recall@100 of 0.94 in 3.4 ms on 1 billion SIFT descriptors
(128-bit codes).

 <dc:description>  The notions of entanglement and nonlocality are among the most striking
ingredients found in quantum information theory. One tool to better understand
these notions is the model of nonlocal games; a mathematical framework that
abstractly models a physical system. The simplest instance of a nonlocal game
involves two players, Alice and Bob, who are not allowed to communicate with
each other once the game has started and who play cooperatively against an
adversary referred to as the referee. The focus of this thesis is a class of
games called extended nonlocal games, of which nonlocal games are a subset. In
an extended nonlocal game, the players initially share a tripartite state with
the referee. In such games, the winning conditions for Alice and Bob may depend
on outcomes of measurements made by the referee, on its part of the shared
quantum state, in addition to Alice and Bob's answers to the questions sent by
the referee. We build up the framework for extended nonlocal games and study
their properties and how they relate to nonlocal games.

 <dc:description>  In one-way quantum computation (1WQC) model, an initial highly entangled
state called a graph state is used to perform universal quantum computations by
a sequence of adaptive single-qubit measurements and post-measurement Pauli-X
and Pauli-Z corrections. The needed computations are organized as measurement
patterns, or simply patterns, in the 1WQC model. The entanglement operations in
a pattern can be shown by a graph which together with the set of its input and
output qubits is called the geometry of the pattern. Since a one-way quantum
computation pattern is based on quantum measurements, which are fundamentally
nondeterministic evolutions, there must be conditions over geometries to
guarantee determinism. Causal flow is a sufficient and generalized flow (gflow)
is a necessary and sufficient condition over geometries to identify a
dependency structure for the measurement sequences in order to achieve
determinism. Previously, three optimization methods have been proposed to
simplify 1WQC patterns which are called standardization, signal shifting and
Pauli simplification. These optimizations can be performed using measurement
calculus formalism by rewriting rules. However, maintaining and searching these
rules in the library can be complicated with respect to implementation.
Moreover, serial execution of these rules is time consuming due to executing
many ineffective commutation rules. To overcome this problem, in this paper, a
new scheme is proposed to perform optimization techniques on patterns with flow
or gflow only based on their geometries instead of using rewriting rules.
Furthermore, the proposed scheme obtains the maximally delayed gflow order for
geometries with flow. It is shown that the time complexity of the proposed
approach is improved over the previous ones.

 <dc:description>  A fundamental question in language learning concerns the role of a speaker's
first language in second language acquisition. We present a novel methodology
for studying this question: analysis of eye-movement patterns in second
language reading of free-form text. Using this methodology, we demonstrate for
the first time that the native language of English learners can be predicted
from their gaze fixations when reading English. We provide analysis of
classifier uncertainty and learned features, which indicates that differences
in English reading are likely to be rooted in linguistic divergences across
native languages. The presented framework complements production studies and
offers new ground for advancing research on multilingualism.

 <dc:description>  The threat to safety of aging bridges has been recognized as a critical
concern to the general public due to the poor condition of many bridges in the
U.S. Currently, the bridge inspection is conducted manually, and it is not
efficient to identify bridge condition deterioration in order to facilitate
implementation of appropriate maintenance or rehabilitation procedures. In this
paper, we report a new development of the autonomous mobile robotic system for
bridge deck inspection and evaluation. The robot is integrated with several
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) sensors and a navigation control algorithm to
allow it to accurately and autonomously maneuver on the bridge deck to collect
visual images and conduct NDE measurements. The developed robotic system can
reduce the cost and time of the bridge deck data collection and inspection. For
efficient bridge deck monitoring, the crack detection algorithm to build the
deck crack map is presented in detail. The impact-echo (IE), ultrasonic surface
waves (USW) and electrical resistivity (ER) data collected by the robot are
analyzed to generate the delamination, concrete elastic modulus, corrosion maps
of the bridge deck, respectively. The presented robotic system has been
successfully deployed to inspect numerous bridges in more than ten different
states in the U.S.

 <dc:title>Towards Instance Segmentation with Object Priority: Prominent Object
  Detection and Recognition</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This manuscript introduces the problem of prominent object detection and
recognition inspired by the fact that human seems to priorities perception of
scene elements. The problem deals with finding the most important region of
interest, segmenting the relevant item/object in that area, and assigning it an
object class label. In other words, we are solving the three problems of
saliency modeling, saliency detection, and object recognition under one
umbrella. The motivation behind such a problem formulation is (1) the benefits
to the knowledge representation-based vision pipelines, and (2) the potential
improvements in emulating bio-inspired vision systems by solving these three
problems together. We are foreseeing extending this problem formulation to
fully semantically segmented scenes with instance object priority for
high-level inferences in various applications including assistive vision. Along
with a new problem definition, we also propose a method to achieve such a task.
The proposed model predicts the most important area in the image, segments the
associated objects, and labels them. The proposed problem and method are
evaluated against human fixations, annotated segmentation masks, and object
class categories. We define a chance level for each of the evaluation criterion
to compare the proposed algorithm with. Despite the good performance of the
proposed baseline, the overall evaluations indicate that the problem of
prominent object detection and recognition is a challenging task that is still
worth investigating further.

 <dc:description>  We present a new class of service for location based social networks, called
the Flexible Group Spatial Keyword Query, which enables a group of users to
collectively find a point of interest (POI) that optimizes an aggregate cost
function combining both spatial distances and keyword similarities. In
addition, our query service allows users to consider the tradeoffs between
obtaining a sub-optimal solution for the entire group and obtaining an
optimimized solution but only for a subgroup.
  We propose algorithms to process three variants of the query: (i) the group
nearest neighbor with keywords query, which finds a POI that optimizes the
aggregate cost function for the whole group of size n, (ii) the subgroup
nearest neighbor with keywords query, which finds the optimal subgroup and a
POI that optimizes the aggregate cost function for a given subgroup size m (m
&lt;= n), and (iii) the multiple subgroup nearest neighbor with keywords query,
which finds optimal subgroups and corresponding POIs for each of the subgroup
sizes in the range [m, n]. We design query processing algorithms based on
branch-and-bound and best-first paradigms. Finally, we provide theoretical
bounds and conduct extensive experiments with two real datasets which verify
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

 <dc:title>Strictly Balancing Matrices in Polynomial Time Using Osborne's Iteration</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Osborne's iteration is a method for balancing $n\times n$ matrices which is
widely used in linear algebra packages, as balancing preserves eigenvalues and
stabilizes their numeral computation. The iteration can be implemented in any
norm over $\mathbb{R}^n$, but it is normally used in the $L_2$ norm. The choice
of norm not only affects the desired balance condition, but also defines the
iterated balancing step itself.
  In this paper we focus on Osborne's iteration in any $L_p$ norm, where $p &lt;
\infty$. We design a specific implementation of Osborne's iteration in any
$L_p$ norm that converges to a strictly $\epsilon$-balanced matrix in
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2}n^{9} K)$ iterations, where $K$ measures, roughly, the
{\em number of bits} required to represent the entries of the input matrix.
  This is the first result that proves that Osborne's iteration in the $L_2$
norm (or any $L_p$ norm, $p &lt; \infty$) strictly balances matrices in polynomial
time. This is a substantial improvement over our recent result (in SODA 2017)
that showed weak balancing in $L_p$ norms. Previously, Schulman and Sinclair
(STOC 2015) showed strong balancing of Osborne's iteration in the $L_\infty$
norm. Their result does not imply any bounds on strict balancing in other
norms.

 <dc:description>  To answer the question in machine comprehension (MC) task, the models need to
establish the interaction between the question and the context. To tackle the
problem that the single-pass model cannot reflect on and correct its answer, we
present Ruminating Reader. Ruminating Reader adds a second pass of attention
and a novel information fusion component to the Bi-Directional Attention Flow
model (BiDAF). We propose novel layer structures that construct an query-aware
context vector representation and fuse encoding representation with
intermediate representation on top of BiDAF model. We show that a multi-hop
attention mechanism can be applied to a bi-directional attention structure. In
experiments on SQuAD, we find that the Reader outperforms the BiDAF baseline by
a substantial margin, and matches or surpasses the performance of all other
published systems.

 <dc:title>Recognizing Descriptive Wikipedia Categories for Historical Figures</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Wikipedia is a useful knowledge source that benefits many applications in
language processing and knowledge representation. An important feature of
Wikipedia is that of categories. Wikipedia pages are assigned different
categories according to their contents as human-annotated labels which can be
used in information retrieval, ad hoc search improvements, entity ranking and
tag recommendations. However, important pages are usually assigned too many
categories, which makes it difficult to recognize the most important ones that
give the best descriptions.
  In this paper, we propose an approach to recognize the most descriptive
Wikipedia categories. We observe that historical figures in a precise category
presumably are mutually similar and such categorical coherence could be
evaluated via texts or Wikipedia links of corresponding members in the
category. We rank descriptive level of Wikipedia categories according to their
coherence and our ranking yield an overall agreement of 88.27% compared with
human wisdom.

 <dc:description>  Neural machine translation represents an exciting leap forward in translation
quality. But what longstanding weaknesses does it resolve, and which remain? We
address these questions with a challenge set approach to translation evaluation
and error analysis. A challenge set consists of a small set of sentences, each
hand-designed to probe a system's capacity to bridge a particular structural
divergence between languages. To exemplify this approach, we present an
English-French challenge set, and use it to analyze phrase-based and neural
systems. The resulting analysis provides not only a more fine-grained picture
of the strengths of neural systems, but also insight into which linguistic
phenomena remain out of reach.

 <dc:description>  Self-paced learning and hard example mining re-weight training instances to
improve learning accuracy. This paper presents two improved alternatives based
on lightweight estimates of sample uncertainty in stochastic gradient descent
(SGD): the variance in predicted probability of the correct class across
iterations of mini-batch SGD, and the proximity of the correct class
probability to the decision threshold. Extensive experimental results on six
datasets show that our methods reliably improve accuracy in various network
architectures, including additional gains on top of other popular training
techniques, such as residual learning, momentum, ADAM, batch normalization,
dropout, and distillation.

 <dc:description>  To bridge the gap between humans and machines in image understanding and
describing, we need further insight into how people describe a perceived scene.
In this paper, we study the agreement between bottom-up saliency-based visual
attention and object referrals in scene description constructs. We investigate
the properties of human-written descriptions and machine-generated ones. We
then propose a saliency-boosted image captioning model in order to investigate
benefits from low-level cues in language models. We learn that (1) humans
mention more salient objects earlier than less salient ones in their
descriptions, (2) the better a captioning model performs, the better attention
agreement it has with human descriptions, (3) the proposed saliency-boosted
model, compared to its baseline form, does not improve significantly on the MS
COCO database, indicating explicit bottom-up boosting does not help when the
task is well learnt and tuned on a data, (4) a better generalization is,
however, observed for the saliency-boosted model on unseen data.

 <dc:description>  With introduction of new technologies in the operating room like the da Vinci
Surgical System, training surgeons to use them effectively and efficiently is
crucial in the delivery of better patient care. Coaching by an expert surgeon
is effective in teaching relevant technical skills, but current methods to
deliver effective coaching are limited and not scalable. We present a virtual
reality simulation-based framework for automated virtual coaching in surgical
education. We implement our framework within the da Vinci Skills Simulator. We
provide three coaching modes ranging from a hands-on teacher (continuous
guidance) to a handsoff guide (assistance upon request). We present six
teaching cues targeted at critical learning elements of a needle passing task,
which are shown to the user based on the coaching mode. These cues are
graphical overlays which guide the user, inform them about sub-par performance,
and show relevant video demonstrations. We evaluated our framework in a pilot
randomized controlled trial with 16 subjects in each arm. In a post-study
questionnaire, participants reported high comprehension of feedback, and
perceived improvement in performance. After three practice repetitions of the
task, the control arm (independent learning) showed better motion efficiency
whereas the experimental arm (received real-time coaching) had better
performance of learning elements (as per the ACS Resident Skills Curriculum).
We observed statistically higher improvement in the experimental group based on
one of the metrics (related to needle grasp orientation). In conclusion, we
developed an automated coach that provides real-time cues for surgical training
and demonstrated its feasibility.

day language written by writers with different backgrounds covering various
areas of topics.The paper proposes simple machine learning algorithms and
simple to generate features to solve hard problems. Relying on the scale of the
data available from large sources of knowledge like Wikipedia. We believe such
sources of data are crucial to generate robust solutions for the web with high
accuracy and easy to deploy in practice. The paper achieves 74\% accuracy
classifying native versus non native speakers writing styles.
  Moreover, the paper shows some interesting observations on the similarity
between different languages measured by the similarity of their users English
writing styles. This technique could be used to show some well known facts
about languages as in grouping them into families, which our experiments
support.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study polynomial norms, i.e. norms that are the
$d^{\text{th}}$ root of a degree-$d$ homogeneous polynomial $f$. We first show
that a necessary and sufficient condition for $f^{1/d}$ to be a norm is for $f$
to be strictly convex, or equivalently, convex and positive definite. Though
not all norms come from $d^{\text{th}}$ roots of polynomials, we prove that any
norm can be approximated arbitrarily well by a polynomial norm. We then
investigate the computational problem of testing whether a form gives a
polynomial norm. We show that this problem is strongly NP-hard already when the
degree of the form is 4, but can always be answered by testing feasibility of a
semidefinite program (of possibly large size). We further study the problem of
optimizing over the set of polynomial norms using semidefinite programming. To
do this, we introduce the notion of r-sos-convexity and extend a result of
Reznick on sum of squares representation of positive definite forms to positive
definite biforms. We conclude with some applications of polynomial norms to
statistics and dynamical systems.

measuring the cosine similarity between word pairs under each algorithm and by
applying each algorithm in the downstream task of hashtag prediction on a

as a streaming replacement for word2vec. Finally, we discuss potential failure

 <dc:description>  Data stream learning has been largely studied for extracting knowledge
structures from continuous and rapid data records. In the semantic Web, data is
interpreted in ontologies and its ordered sequence is represented as an
ontology stream. Our work exploits the semantics of such streams to tackle the
problem of concept drift i.e., unexpected changes in data distribution, causing
most of models to be less accurate as time passes. To this end we revisited (i)
semantic inference in the context of supervised stream learning, and (ii)
models with semantic embeddings. The experiments show accurate prediction with
data from Dublin and Beijing.

 <dc:description>  String Kernel (SK) techniques, especially those using gapped $k$-mers as
features (gk), have obtained great success in classifying sequences like DNA,
protein, and text. However, the state-of-the-art gk-SK runs extremely slow when
we increase the dictionary size ($\Sigma$) or allow more mismatches ($M$). This
is because current gk-SK uses a trie-based algorithm to calculate co-occurrence
of mismatched substrings resulting in a time cost proportional to
$O(\Sigma^{M})$. We propose a \textbf{fast} algorithm for calculating
\underline{Ga}pped $k$-mer \underline{K}ernel using \underline{Co}unting
(GaKCo). GaKCo uses associative arrays to calculate the co-occurrence of
substrings using cumulative counting. This algorithm is fast, scalable to
larger $\Sigma$ and $M$, and naturally parallelizable. We provide a rigorous
asymptotic analysis that compares GaKCo with the state-of-the-art gk-SK.
Theoretically, the time cost of GaKCo is independent of the $\Sigma^{M}$ term
that slows down the trie-based approach. Experimentally, we observe that GaKCo
achieves the same accuracy as the state-of-the-art and outperforms its speed by
factors of 2, 100, and 4, on classifying sequences of DNA (5 datasets), protein
(12 datasets), and character-based English text (2 datasets), respectively.
  GaKCo is shared as an open source tool at

 <dc:title>To Agile, or not to Agile: A Comparison of Software Development

 <dc:description>  Since the Agile Manifesto, many organizations have explored agile development
methods to replace traditional waterfall development. Interestingly, waterfall
remains the most widely used practice, suggesting that there is something
missing from the many &quot;flavors&quot; of agile methodologies. We explore seven of the
most common practices to explore this, and evaluate each against a series of
criteria centered around product quality and adherence to agile practices. We
find that no methodology entirely replaces waterfall and summarize the
strengths and weaknesses of each. From this, we conclude that agile methods
are, as a whole, unable to cope with the realities of technical debt and large
scale systems. Ultimately, no one methodology fits all projects.

 <dc:title>Active Target Tracking with Self-Triggered Communications in Multi-Robot

 <dc:creator>Zhou, Lifeng</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tokekar, Pratap</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of reducing the amount of communication in decentralized
target tracking. We focus on the scenario where a team of robots are allowed to
move on the boundary of the environment. Their goal is to seek a formation so
as to best track a target moving in the interior of the environment. The robots
are capable of measuring distances to the target. Decentralized control
strategies have been proposed in the past that guarantee that the robots
asymptotically converge to the optimal formation. However, existing methods
require that the robots exchange information with their neighbors at all time
steps. Instead, we focus on decentralized strategies to reduce the amount of
communication among robots.
  We propose a self-triggered communication strategy that decides when a
particular robot should seek up-to-date information from its neighbors and when
it is safe to operate with possibly outdated information. We prove that this
strategy converges asymptotically to a desired formation when the target is
stationary. For the case of a mobile target, we propose an extension whereby
each robot decides its optimal partner to share its measurements with using
observability as a criterion. We evaluate all the approaches (constant
communication and self-triggered communication with centralized and
decentralized sensor fusion) through simulations.

 <dc:title>A New Theoretical Framework for Curiosity for Learning in Social

 <dc:description>  Curiosity is a vital metacognitive skill in educational contexts. Yet, little
is known about how social factors influence curiosity in group work. We argue
that curiosity is evoked not only through individual, but also interpersonal
activities, and present what we believe to be the first theoretical framework
that articulates an integrated socio-cognitive account of curiosity based on
literature spanning psychology, learning sciences and group dynamics, along
with empirical observation of small-group science activity in an informal
learning environment. We make a bipartite distinction between individual and
interpersonal functions that contribute to curiosity, and multimodal behaviors
that fulfill these functions. We validate the proposed framework by leveraging
a longitudinal latent variable modeling approach. Findings confirm positive
predictive relationship of the latent variables of individual and interpersonal
functions on curiosity, with the interpersonal functions exercising a
comparatively stronger influence. Prominent behavioral realizations of these
functions are also discovered in a data-driven way. This framework is a step
towards designing learning technologies that can recognize and evoke curiosity
during learning in social contexts.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Exponential Linear Units (ELUs) are a useful rectifier for constructing deep
learning architectures, as they may speed up and otherwise improve learning by
virtue of not have vanishing gradients and by having mean activations near
zero. However, the ELU activation as parametrized in [1] is not continuously
differentiable with respect to its input when the shape parameter alpha is not
equal to 1. We present an alternative parametrization which is C1 continuous
for all values of alpha, making the rectifier easier to reason about and making
alpha easier to tune. This alternative parametrization has several other useful
properties that the original parametrization of ELU does not: 1) its derivative
with respect to x is bounded, 2) it contains both the linear transfer function
and ReLU as special cases, and 3) it is scale-similar with respect to alpha.

 <dc:description>  Using predictive models to identify patterns that can act as biomarkers for
different neuropathoglogical conditions is becoming highly prevalent. In this
paper, we consider the problem of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
classification. While non-invasive imaging measurements, such as the rest state
fMRI, are typically used in this problem, it can be beneficial to incorporate a
wide variety of non-imaging features, including personal and socio-cultural
traits, into predictive modeling. We propose to employ a graph-based approach
for combining both types of feature, where a contextual graph encodes the
traits of a larger population while the brain activity patterns are defined as
a multivariate function at the nodes of the graph. Since the underlying graph
dictates the performance of the resulting predictive models, we explore the use
of different graph construction strategies. Furthermore, we develop a
bootstrapped version of graph convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) that
utilizes an ensemble of weakly trained G-CNNs to avoid overfitting and also
reduce the sensitivity of the models on the choice of graph construction. We
demonstrate its effectiveness on the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)
dataset and show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches for this problem.

 <dc:description>  Video captioning, the task of describing the content of a video, has seen
some promising improvements in recent years with sequence-to-sequence models,
but accurately learning the temporal and logical dynamics involved in the task
still remains a challenge, especially given the lack of sufficient annotated
data. We improve video captioning by sharing knowledge with two related
directed-generation tasks: a temporally-directed unsupervised video prediction
task to learn richer context-aware video encoder representations, and a
logically-directed language entailment generation task to learn better
video-entailed caption decoder representations. For this, we present a
many-to-many multi-task learning model that shares parameters across the
encoders and decoders of the three tasks. We achieve significant improvements
and the new state-of-the-art on several standard video captioning datasets
using diverse automatic and human evaluations. We also show mutual multi-task
improvements on the entailment generation task.

 <dc:description>  Aiming to reduce pollutant emissions, bicycles are regaining popularity
specially in urban areas. However, the number of cyclists' fatalities is not
showing the same decreasing trend as the other traffic groups. Hence,
monitoring cyclists' data appears as a keystone to foster urban cyclists'
safety by helping urban planners to design safer cyclist routes. In this work,
we propose a fully image-based framework to assess the rout risk from the
cyclist perspective. From smartphone sequences of images, this generic
framework is able to automatically identify events considering different risk
criteria based on the cyclist's motion and object detection. Moreover, since it
is entirely based on images, our method provides context on the situation and
is independent from the expertise level of the cyclist. Additionally, we build
on an existing platform and introduce several improvements on its mobile app to
acquire smartphone sensor data, including video. From the inertial sensor data,
we automatically detect the route segments performed by bicycle, applying
behavior analysis techniques. We test our methods on real data, attaining very
promising results in terms of risk classification, according to two different
criteria, and behavior analysis accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Increasing data traffic demands over wireless spectrum have necessitated
spectrum sharing and coexistence between heterogeneous systems such as radar
and cellular communications systems. In this context, we specifically
investigate the co-channel coexistence between an air traffic control (ATC)
radar and a wide area cellular communication (comms) system. We present a
comprehensive characterization and analysis of interference caused by the comms
system on the ATC radar with respect to multiple parameters such as radar
range, protection radius around the radar, and radar antenna elevation angle.
The analysis suggests that maintaining a protection radius of 50 km around the
radar will ensure the required INR protection criterion of -10 dB at the radar
receiver with ~0.9 probability, even when the radar beam is in the same horizon
as the comms BS. Detailed evaluations of the radar target detection performance
provide a framework to choose appropriate protection radii around the radar to
meet specific performance requirements.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a coverage problem for uncertain points in a tree.
Let T be a tree containing a set P of n (weighted) demand points, and the
location of each demand point P_i\in P is uncertain but is known to appear in
one of m_i points on T each associated with a probability. Given a covering
range \lambda, the problem is to find a minimum number of points (called
centers) on T to build facilities for serving (or covering) these demand points
in the sense that for each uncertain point P_i\in P, the expected distance from
P_i to at least one center is no more than $\lambda$. The problem has not been
studied before. We present an O(|T|+M\log^2 M) time algorithm for the problem,
where |T| is the number of vertices of T and M is the total number of locations
of all uncertain points of P, i.e., M=\sum_{P_i\in P}m_i. In addition, by using
this algorithm, we solve a k-center problem on T for the uncertain points of P.

 <dc:description>  Patient time series classification faces challenges in high degrees of
dimensionality and missingness. In light of patient similarity theory, this
study explores effective temporal feature engineering and reduction, missing
value imputation, and change point detection methods that can afford
similarity-based classification models with desirable accuracy enhancement. We
select a piecewise aggregation approximation method to extract fine-grain
temporal features and propose a minimalist method to impute missing values in
temporal features. For dimensionality reduction, we adopt a gradient descent
search method for feature weight assignment. We propose new patient status and
directional change definitions based on medical knowledge or clinical
guidelines about the value ranges for different patient status levels, and
develop a method to detect change points indicating positive or negative
patient status changes. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods
in the context of early Intensive Care Unit mortality prediction. The
evaluation results show that the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm that incorporates
methods we select and propose significantly outperform the relevant benchmarks
for early ICU mortality prediction. This study makes contributions to time
series classification and early ICU mortality prediction via identifying and
enhancing temporal feature engineering and reduction methods for
similarity-based time series classification.

 <dc:description>  To date, developing a good model for early intensive care unit (ICU)
mortality prediction is still challenging. This paper presents a patient based
predictive modeling framework (PPMF) to improve the performance of ICU
mortality prediction using data collected during the first 48 hours of ICU
admission. PPMF consists of three main components verifying three related
research hypotheses. The first component captures dynamic changes of patients
status in the ICU using their time series data (e.g., vital signs and
laboratory tests). The second component is a local approximation algorithm that
classifies patients based on their similarities. The third component is a
Gradient Decent wrapper that updates feature weights according to the
classification feedback. Experiments using data from MIMICIII show that PPMF
significantly outperforms: (1) the severity score systems, namely SASP III,
APACHE IV, and MPM0III, (2) the aggregation based classifiers that utilize
summarized time series, and (3) baseline feature selection methods.

 <dc:description>  Segmenting blood vessels in fundus imaging plays an important role in medical
diagnosis. Many algorithms have been proposed. While deep Neural Networks have
been attracting enormous attention from computer vision community recent years
and several novel works have been done in terms of its application in retinal
blood vessel segmentation, most of them are based on supervised learning which
requires amount of labeled data, which is both scarce and expensive to obtain.
We leverage the power of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) in feature
learning, in this work, to achieve this ultimate goal. The highly efficient
feature learning of DCNN inspires our novel approach that trains the networks
with automatically-generated samples to achieve desirable performance on
real-world fundus images. For this, we design a set of rules abstracted from
the domain-specific prior knowledge to generate these samples. We argue that,
with the high efficiency of DCNN in feature learning, one can achieve this goal
by constructing the training dataset with prior knowledge, no manual labeling
is needed. This approach allows us to take advantages of supervised learning
without labeling. We also build a naive DCNN model to test it. The results on
standard benchmarks of fundus imaging show it is competitive to the
state-of-the-art methods which implies a potential way to leverage the power of
DCNN in feature learning.

 <dc:description>  There is a wide gap between symbolic reasoning and deep learning. In this
research, we explore the possibility of using deep learning to improve symbolic
reasoning. Briefly, in a reasoning system, a deep feedforward neural network is
used to guide rewriting processes after learning from algebraic reasoning
examples produced by humans. To enable the neural network to recognise patterns
of algebraic expressions with non-deterministic sizes, reduced partial trees
are used to represent the expressions. Also, to represent both top-down and
bottom-up information of the expressions, a centralisation technique is used to
improve the reduced partial trees. Besides, symbolic association vectors and
rule application records are used to improve the rewriting processes.
Experimental results reveal that the algebraic reasoning examples can be
accurately learnt only if the feedforward neural network has enough hidden
layers. Also, the centralisation technique, the symbolic association vectors
and the rule application records can reduce error rates of reasoning. In
particular, the above approaches have led to 4.6% error rate of reasoning on a
dataset of linear equations, differentials and integrals.

 <dc:description>  We present a dynamic model selection approach for resource-constrained
prediction. Given an input instance at test-time, a gating function identifies
a prediction model for the input among a collection of models. Our objective is
to minimize overall average cost without sacrificing accuracy. We learn gating
and prediction models on fully labeled training data by means of a bottom-up
strategy. Our novel bottom-up method is a recursive scheme whereby a
high-accuracy complex model is first trained. Then a low-complexity gating and
prediction model are subsequently learnt to adaptively approximate the
high-accuracy model in regions where low-cost models are capable of making
highly accurate predictions. We pose an empirical loss minimization problem
with cost constraints to jointly train gating and prediction models. On a
number of benchmark datasets our method outperforms state-of-the-art achieving
higher accuracy for the same cost.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, the reliability of information on the Internet has emerged
as a crucial issue of modern society. Social network sites (SNSs) have
revolutionized the way in which information is spread by allowing users to
freely share content. As a consequence, SNSs are also increasingly used as
vectors for the diffusion of misinformation and hoaxes. The amount of
disseminated information and the rapidity of its diffusion make it practically
impossible to assess reliability in a timely manner, highlighting the need for
automatic hoax detection systems.
  As a contribution towards this objective, we show that Facebook posts can be
classified with high accuracy as hoaxes or non-hoaxes on the basis of the users
who &quot;liked&quot; them. We present two classification techniques, one based on
logistic regression, the other on a novel adaptation of boolean crowdsourcing
algorithms. On a dataset consisting of 15,500 Facebook posts and 909,236 users,
we obtain classification accuracies exceeding 99% even when the training set
contains less than 1% of the posts. We further show that our techniques are
robust: they work even when we restrict our attention to the users who like
both hoax and non-hoax posts. These results suggest that mapping the diffusion
pattern of information can be a useful component of automatic hoax detection
systems.

 <dc:description>  Asymmetry is unquestionably an important characteristic of the wireless
propagation channel, which needs to be accurately modeled for wireless and
mobile communications, 5G networks, and associated applications such as
indoor/outdoor localization. This paper reports on the potential causes of
propagation asymmetry. Practical channel measurements at Khalifa University
premises proved that wireless channels are asymmetric in realistic scenarios.
Some important conclusions and recommendation are also summarized.

 <dc:title>Scalable Planning with Tensorflow for Hybrid Nonlinear Domains</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given recent deep learning results that demonstrate the ability to
effectively optimize high-dimensional non-convex functions with gradient
descent optimization on GPUs, we ask in this paper whether symbolic gradient
optimization tools such as Tensorflow can be effective for planning in hybrid
(mixed discrete and continuous) nonlinear domains with high dimensional state
and action spaces? To this end, we demonstrate that hybrid planning with
Tensorflow and RMSProp gradient descent is competitive with mixed integer
linear program (MILP) based optimization on piecewise linear planning domains
(where we can compute optimal solutions) and substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art interior point methods for nonlinear planning domains.
Furthermore, we remark that Tensorflow is highly scalable, converging to a
strong plan on a large-scale concurrent domain with a total of 576,000
continuous action parameters distributed over a horizon of 96 time steps and
100 parallel instances in only 4 minutes. We provide a number of insights that
clarify such strong performance including observations that despite long
horizons, RMSProp avoids both the vanishing and exploding gradient problems.
Together these results suggest a new frontier for highly scalable planning in
nonlinear hybrid domains by leveraging GPUs and the power of recent advances in
gradient descent with highly optimized toolkits like Tensorflow.

 <dc:title>Deep Over-sampling Framework for Classifying Imbalanced Data</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  Class imbalance is a challenging issue in practical classification problems
for deep learning models as well as traditional models. Traditionally
successful countermeasures such as synthetic over-sampling have had limited
success with complex, structured data handled by deep learning models. In this
paper, we propose Deep Over-sampling (DOS), a framework for extending the
synthetic over-sampling method to exploit the deep feature space acquired by a
convolutional neural network (CNN). Its key feature is an explicit, supervised
representation learning, for which the training data presents each raw input
sample with a synthetic embedding target in the deep feature space, which is
sampled from the linear subspace of in-class neighbors. We implement an
iterative process of training the CNN and updating the targets, which induces
smaller in-class variance among the embeddings, to increase the discriminative
power of the deep representation. We present an empirical study using public
benchmarks, which shows that the DOS framework not only counteracts class
imbalance better than the existing method, but also improves the performance of
the CNN in the standard, balanced settings.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the design of the optimal routing path in a moving vehicles
involved the internet of things (IoT). In our model, jammers exist that may
interfere with the information exchange between wireless nodes, leading to
worsened quality of service (QoS) in communications. In addition, the transmit
power of each battery-equipped node is constrained to save energy. We propose a
three-step optimal routing path algorithm for reliable and energy-efficient
communications. Moreover, results show that with the assistance of moving
vehicles, the total energy consumed can be reduced to a large extend. We also
study the impact on the optimal routing path design and energy consumption
which is caused by path loss, maximum transmit power constrain, QoS
requirement, etc.

 <dc:description>  We collect and analyze the darkweb (a.k.a. the &quot;onionweb&quot;) hyperlink graph.
We find properties highly dissimilar to the well-studied world wide web
hyperlink graph; for example, our analysis finds that &gt;87% of darkweb sites
never link to another site. We compare our results to prior work on
world-wide-web and speculate about reasons for their differences. We conclude
that in the term &quot;darkweb&quot;, the word &quot;web&quot; is a connectivity misnomer. Instead,
it is more accurate to view the darkweb as a set of largely isolated dark
silos.

 <dc:description>  To watch 360{\deg} videos on normal 2D displays, we need to project the
selected part of the 360{\deg} image onto the 2D display plane. In this paper,
we propose a fully-automated framework for generating content-aware 2D
normal-view perspective videos from 360{\deg} videos. Especially, we focus on
the projection step preserving important image contents and reducing image
distortion. Basically, our projection method is based on Pannini projection
model. At first, the salient contents such as linear structures and salient
regions in the image are preserved by optimizing the single Panini projection
model. Then, the multiple Panini projection models at salient regions are
interpolated to suppress image distortion globally. Finally, the temporal
consistency for image projection is enforced for producing temporally stable
normal-view videos. Our proposed projection method does not require any
user-interaction and is much faster than previous content-preserving methods.
It can be applied to not only images but also videos taking the temporal
consistency of projection into account. Experiments on various 360{\deg} videos
show the superiority of the proposed projection method quantitatively and
qualitatively.

 <dc:description>  Tasks like code generation and semantic parsing require mapping unstructured
(or partially structured) inputs to well-formed, executable outputs. We
introduce abstract syntax networks, a modeling framework for these problems.
The outputs are represented as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and constructed by
a decoder with a dynamically-determined modular structure paralleling the
structure of the output tree. On the benchmark Hearthstone dataset for code
generation, our model obtains 79.2 BLEU and 22.7% exact match accuracy,
compared to previous state-of-the-art values of 67.1 and 6.1%. Furthermore, we
perform competitively on the Atis, Jobs, and Geo semantic parsing datasets with
no task-specific engineering.

 <dc:description>  A special homotopy continuation method, as a combination of the polyhedral
homotopy and the linear product homotopy, is proposed for computing all the
isolated solutions to a special class of polynomial systems. The root number
bound of this method is between the total degree bound and the mixed volume
bound and can be easily computed. The new algorithm has been implemented as a
program called LPH using C++. Our experiments show its efficiency compared to
the polyhedral or other homotopies on such systems. As an application, the
algorithm can be used to find witness points on each connected component of a
real variety.

 <dc:description>  Path planning for multiple robots is well studied in the AI and robotics
communities. For a given discretized environment, robots need to find
collision-free paths to a set of specified goal locations. Robots can be fully
anonymous, non-anonymous, or organized in groups. Although powerful solvers for
this abstract problem exist, they make simplifying assumptions by ignoring
kinematic constraints, making it difficult to use the resulting plans on actual
robots. In this paper, we present a solution which takes kinematic constraints,
such as maximum velocities, into account, while guaranteeing a user-specified
minimum safety distance between robots. We demonstrate our approach in
simulation and on real robots in 2D and 3D environments.

 <dc:description>  We consider the well-studied Hospital Residents (HR) problem in the presence
of lower quotas (LQ). The input instance consists of a bipartite graph $G =
(\mathcal{R} \cup \mathcal{H}, E)$ where $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ denote
sets of residents and hospitals respectively. Every vertex has a preference
list that imposes a strict ordering on its neighbors. In addition, each
hospital $h$ has an associated upper-quota $q^+(h)$ and lower-quota $q^-(h)$. A
matching $M$ in $G$ is an assignment of residents to hospitals, and $M$ is said
to be feasible if every resident is assigned to at most one hospital and a
hospital $h$ is assigned at least $q^-(h)$ and at most $q^+(h)$ residents.
  Stability is a de-facto notion of optimality in a model where both sets of
vertices have preferences. A matching is stable if no unassigned pair has an
incentive to deviate from it. It is well-known that an instance of the HRLQ
problem need not admit a feasible stable matching. In this paper, we consider
the notion of popularity for the HRLQ problem. A matching $M$ is popular if no
other matching $M'$ gets more votes than $M$ when vertices vote between $M$ and
$M'$. When there are no lower quotas, there always exists a stable matching and
it is known that every stable matching is popular.
  We show that in an HRLQ instance, although a feasible stable matching need
not exist, there is always a matching that is popular in the set of feasible
matchings. We give an efficient algorithm to compute a maximum cardinality
matching that is popular amongst all the feasible matchings in an HRLQ
instance.

 <dc:description>  In emotion recognition, it is difficult to recognize human's emotional states
using just a single modality. Besides, the annotation of physiological
emotional data is particularly expensive. These two aspects make the building
of effective emotion recognition model challenging. In this paper, we first
build a multi-view deep generative model to simulate the generative process of
multi-modality emotional data. By imposing a mixture of Gaussians assumption on
the posterior approximation of the latent variables, our model can learn the
shared deep representation from multiple modalities. To solve the
labeled-data-scarcity problem, we further extend our multi-view model to
semi-supervised learning scenario by casting the semi-supervised classification
problem as a specialized missing data imputation task. Our semi-supervised
multi-view deep generative framework can leverage both labeled and unlabeled
data from multiple modalities, where the weight factor for each modality can be
learned automatically. Compared with previous emotion recognition methods, our
method is more robust and flexible. The experiments conducted on two real
multi-modal emotion datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our framework
over a number of competitors.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a rigorous methodology applied for
Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE) that identify, assess and synthesize
the relevant evidence for answering specific research questions. Benefiting
from the booming online materials in the era of Web 2.0, the technical Web
content starts acting as alternative sources for EBSE. Web knowledge has been
investigated and derived from Web content mining and knowledge discovery
techniques, however they are still significantly different from reviewing
academic literature. Thus the direct adoption of Web knowledge in EBSE lacks of
systematic guidelines. In this paper, we propose to make an SLR adaptation to
bridge the aforementioned gap along two stages. Firstly, we follow the general
logic and procedure of SLR to regulate Web mining activities. Secondly, we
substitute and enhance particular SLR processes with Web-mining-friendly
methods and approaches. At the second stage, we mainly focus on adapting
Conducting Review by integrating a set of automated components ranging from
programmatic searching to various text mining techniques.

 <dc:description>  In vehicular scenarios context awareness is a key enabler for road safety.
However, the amount of contextual information that can be collected by a
vehicle is stringently limited by the sensor technology itself (e.g.,
line-of-sight, coverage, weather robustness) and by the low bandwidths offered
by current wireless vehicular technologies such as DSRC/802.11p. Motivated by
the upsurge of research around millimeter-wave vehicle-to-anything (V2X)
communications, in this work we propose a distributed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
association scheme that considers a quantitative measure of the potential value
of the shared contextual information in the pairing process. First, we properly
define the utility function of every vehicle balancing classical channel state
and queuing state information (CSI/QSI) with context information i.e., sensing
content resolution, timeliness and enhanced range of the sensing. Next we solve
the problem via a distributed many-to-one matching game in a junction scenario
with realistic vehicular mobility traces. It is shown that when receivers are
able to leverage information from different sources, the average volume of
collected extended sensed information under our proposed scheme is up to 71%
more than that of distance and minimum delay-based matching baselines.

 <dc:description>  This work introduces a method to tune a sequence-based generative model for
molecular de novo design that through augmented episodic likelihood can learn
to generate structures with certain specified desirable properties. We
demonstrate how this model can execute a range of tasks such as generating
analogues to a query structure and generating compounds predicted to be active
against a biological target. As a proof of principle, the model is first
trained to generate molecules that do not contain sulphur. As a second example,
the model is trained to generate analogues to the drug Celecoxib, a technique
that could be used for scaffold hopping or library expansion starting from a
single molecule. Finally, when tuning the model towards generating compounds
predicted to be active against the dopamine receptor type 2, the model
generates structures of which more than 95% are predicted to be active,
including experimentally confirmed actives that have not been included in
either the generative model nor the activity prediction model.

 <dc:description>  Different linguistic perspectives causes many diverse segmentation criteria
for Chinese word segmentation (CWS). Most existing methods focus on improve the
performance for each single criterion. However, it is interesting to exploit
these different criteria and mining their common underlying knowledge. In this
paper, we propose adversarial multi-criteria learning for CWS by integrating
shared knowledge from multiple heterogeneous segmentation criteria. Experiments
on eight corpora with heterogeneous segmentation criteria show that the
performance of each corpus obtains a significant improvement, compared to
single-criterion learning. Source codes of this paper are available on Github.

the method of Labeur and Wells that it is possible to formulate a simple method
with pointwise divergence-free velocity fields, and which is both momentum
conserving and energy stable. Theoretical results are verified by two- and
three-dimensional numerical examples and for different orders of polynomial

 <dc:description>  Decoding human brain activities via functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) has gained increasing attention in recent years. While encouraging
results have been reported in brain states classification tasks, reconstructing
the details of human visual experience still remains difficult. Two main
challenges that hinder the development of effective models are the perplexing
fMRI measurement noise and the high dimensionality of limited data instances.
Existing methods generally suffer from one or both of these issues and yield
dissatisfactory results. In this paper, we tackle this problem by casting the
reconstruction of visual stimulus as the Bayesian inference of missing view in
a multiview latent variable model. Sharing a common latent representation, our
joint generative model of external stimulus and brain response is not only
&quot;deep&quot; in extracting nonlinear features from visual images, but also powerful
in capturing correlations among voxel activities of fMRI recordings. The
nonlinearity and deep structure endow our model with strong representation
ability, while the correlations of voxel activities are critical for
suppressing noise and improving prediction. We devise an efficient variational
Bayesian method to infer the latent variables and the model parameters. To
further improve the reconstruction accuracy, the latent representations of
testing instances are enforced to be close to that of their neighbours from the
training set via posterior regularization. Experiments on three fMRI recording
datasets demonstrate that our approach can more accurately reconstruct visual
stimuli.

 <dc:description>  Light fields become a popular representation of three dimensional scenes, and
there is interest in their processing, resampling, and compression. As those
operations often result in loss of quality, there is a need to quantify it. In
this work, we collect a new dataset of dense reference and distorted light
fields as well as the corresponding quality scores which are scaled in
perceptual units. The scores were acquired in a subjective experiment using an
interactive light-field viewing setup. The dataset contains typical artifacts
that occur in light-field processing chain due to light-field reconstruction,
multi-view compression, and limitations of automultiscopic displays. We test a
number of existing objective quality metrics to determine how well they can
predict the quality of light fields. We find that the existing image quality
metrics provide good measures of light-field quality, but require dense
reference light- fields for optimal performance. For more complex tasks of
comparing two distorted light fields, their performance drops significantly,
which reveals the need for new, light-field-specific metrics.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by map labeling, we study the problem in which we are given a
collection of $n$ disks $D_1, \dots, D_n$ in the plane that grow at possibly
different speeds. Whenever two disks meet, the one with the lower index
disappears. This problem was introduced by Funke, Krumpe, and Storandt [IWOCA
2016]. We provide the first general subquadratic algorithm for computing the
times and the order of disappearance. This algorithm also works for other
shapes (such as rectangles) and in any fixed dimension.
  Using quadtrees, we provide an alternative algorithm that runs in near linear
time, although this second algorithm has a logarithmic dependence on either the
ratio of the fastest speed to the slowest speed of disks or the spread of disk
centers (the ratio of the maximum to the minimum distance between them). Our
result improves the running times of previous algorithms by Funke, Krumpe, and
Storandt [IWOCA 2016], Bahrdt et al. [ALENEX 2017] and Funke and Storandt [EWCG
2017]. Finally, we give an $\Omega(n\log n)$ lower bound on the problem,
showing that our quadtree algorithms are almost tight.

 <dc:title>Estimating Sparse Signals Using Integrated Wideband Dictionaries</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a wideband dictionary framework for estimating
sparse signals. By formulating integrated dictionary elements spanning bands of
the considered parameter space, one may efficiently find and discard large
parts of the parameter space not active in the signal. After each iteration,
the zero-valued parts of the dictionary may be discarded to allow a refined
dictionary to be formed around the active elements, resulting in a zoomed
dictionary to be used in the following iterations. Implementing this scheme
allows for more accurate estimates, at a much lower computational cost, as
compared to directly forming a larger dictionary spanning the whole parameter
space or performing a zooming procedure using standard dictionary elements.
Different from traditional dictionaries, the wideband dictionary allows for the
use of dictionaries with fewer elements than the number of available samples
without loss of resolution. The technique may be used on both one- and
multi-dimensional signals, and may be exploited to refine several traditional
sparse estimators, here illustrated with the LASSO and the SPICE estimators.
Numerical examples illustrate the improved performance.

 <dc:description>  Many studies show that the acquisition of knowledge is the key to build
competitive advantage of companies. We propose a simple model of knowledge
transfer within the organization and we implement the proposed model using
cellular automata technique. In this paper the organisation is considered in
the context of complex systems. In this perspective, the main role in
organisation is played by the network of informal contacts and the distributed
leadership. The goal of this paper is to check which factors influence the
efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Our studies indicate a
significant role of initial concentration of chunks of knowledge for knowledge
transfer process, and the results suggest taking action in the organisation to
shorten the distance (social distance) between people with different levels of
knowledge, or working out incentives to share knowledge.

 <dc:description>  Current state-of-the-art approaches to skeleton-based action recognition are
mostly based on recurrent neural networks (RNN). In this paper, we propose a
novel convolutional neural networks (CNN) based framework for both action
classification and detection. Raw skeleton coordinates as well as skeleton
motion are fed directly into CNN for label prediction. A novel skeleton
transformer module is designed to rearrange and select important skeleton
joints automatically. With a simple 7-layer network, we obtain 89.3% accuracy
on validation set of the NTU RGB+D dataset. For action detection in untrimmed
videos, we develop a window proposal network to extract temporal segment
proposals, which are further classified within the same network. On the recent
PKU-MMD dataset, we achieve 93.7% mAP, surpassing the baseline by a large
margin.

 <dc:description>  Black-Scholes (BS) is the standard mathematical model for option pricing in
financial markets. Option prices are calculated using an analytical formula
whose main inputs are strike (at which price to exercise) and volatility. The
BS framework assumes that volatility remains constant across all strikes,
however, in practice it varies. How do traders come to learn these parameters?
We introduce natural models of learning agents, in which they update their
beliefs about the true implied volatility based on the opinions of other
traders. We prove convergence of these opinion dynamics using techniques from
control theory and leader-follower models, thus providing a resolution between
theory and market practices. We allow for two different models, one with
feedback and one with an unknown leader.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes the use of the Spectral method to simulate diffusive
moisture transfer through porous materials, which can be strongly nonlinear and
can significantly affect sensible and latent heat transfer. An alternative way
for computing solutions by considering a separated representation is presented,
which can be applied to both linear and nonlinear diffusive problems,
considering highly moisture-dependent properties. The Spectral method is
compared with the classical implicit Euler and Crank-Nicolson schemes. The
results show that the Spectral approach enables to accurately simulate the
field of interest. Furthermore, the numerical gains become particularly
interesting for nonlinear cases since the proposed method drastically can
reduce the computer run time by 99% when compared to the traditional
Crank-Nicolson scheme.

 <dc:description>  Multiple antennas have been exploited for spatial multiplexing and diversity
transmission in a wide range of communication applications. However, most of
the advances in the design of high speed wireless multiple-input multiple
output (MIMO) systems are based on information-theoretic principles that
demonstrate how to efficiently transmit signals conforming to Gaussian
distribution. Although the Gaussian signal is capacity-achieving, signals
conforming to discrete constellations are transmitted in practical
communication systems. As a result, this paper is motivated to provide a
comprehensive overview on MIMO transmission design with discrete input signals.
We first summarize the existing fundamental results for MIMO systems with
discrete input signals. Then, focusing on the basic point-to-point MIMO
systems, we examine transmission schemes based on three most important criteria
for communication systems: the mutual information driven designs, the mean
square error driven designs, and the diversity driven designs. Particularly, a
unified framework which designs low complexity transmission schemes applicable
to massive MIMO systems in upcoming 5G wireless networks is provided in the
first time. Moreover, adaptive transmission designs which switch among these
criteria based on the channel conditions to formulate the best transmission
strategy are discussed. Then, we provide a survey of the transmission designs
with discrete input signals for multiuser MIMO scenarios, including MIMO uplink
transmission, MIMO downlink transmission, MIMO interference channel, and MIMO
wiretap channel. Additionally, we discuss the transmission designs with
discrete input signals for other systems using MIMO technology. Finally,
technical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are
summarized and the future trends of transmission designs with discrete input
signals are addressed.

 <dc:title>Joint Transmit and Receive Filter Optimization for Sub-Nyquist Wireless
  Channel Estimation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this article a framework is presented for the joint optimization of the
analog transmit and receive filter with respect to a channel estimation
problem. At the receiver, conventional signal processing systems restrict the
bandwidth of the analog pre-filter $B$ to the rate of the analog-to-digital
converter $f_s$ in order to comply with the well-known Nyquist sampling
theorem. In contrast, here we consider a transceiver that by design violates
the common paradigm $B\leq f_s$. To this end, at the receiver we allow for a
higher pre-filter bandwidth $B&gt;f_s$ and study the achievable channel estimation
accuracy under a fixed sampling rate when the transmit and receive filter are
jointly optimized with respect to the Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound. For
the case of a channel with unknown delay-Doppler shift we show how to
approximate the required Fisher information matrix and solve the transceiver
design problem by an alternating optimization algorithm. The presented approach
allows us to explore the Pareto-optimal region spanned by transmit and receive
filters which are favorable under a weighted mean squared error criterion. We
discuss the complexity of the obtained transceiver design by visualizing the
resulting ambiguity function. Finally, we verify the achievable performance of
the proposed designs by Monte-Carlo simulations of a likelihood-based channel
estimator.

 <dc:description>  The smart meter (SM) privacy problem is addressed together with the cost of
energy for the user. It is assumed that a storage device, e.g., an electrical
battery, is available to the user, which can be utilized both to achieve
privacy and to reduce the energy cost by modifying the energy consumption
profile. Privacy is measured via the mean squared-error between the SM
readings, which are reported to the utility provider (UP), and a target load;
while time-of-use pricing is considered for energy cost calculation. The
optimal trade-off between the achievable privacy and the energy cost is
characterized by taking into account the limited capacity of the battery as
well as the capability to sell energy to the UP. Extensive numerical
simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy
for different system settings.

 <dc:description>  While part-of-speech (POS) tagging and dependency parsing are observed to be

templates suffers from the feature sparsity and incompleteness problems. In
this paper, we propose an approach to joint POS tagging and dependency parsing
using transition-based neural networks. Three neural network based classifiers
are designed to resolve shift/reduce, tagging, and labeling conflicts.
Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms previous methods
for joint POS tagging and dependency parsing across a variety of natural

 <dc:title>Asynchronous Early Output Dual-Bit Full Adders Based on Homogeneous and

 <dc:creator>Balasubramanian, P</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents the designs of asynchronous early output dual-bit full
adders without and with redundant logic (implicit) corresponding to homogeneous
and heterogeneous delay-insensitive data encoding. For homogeneous
delay-insensitive data encoding only dual-rail i.e. 1-of-2 code is used, and
for heterogeneous delay-insensitive data encoding 1-of-2 and 1-of-4 codes are
used. The 4-phase return-to-zero protocol is used for handshaking. To
demonstrate the merits of the proposed dual-bit full adder designs, 32-bit
ripple carry adders (RCAs) are constructed comprising dual-bit full adders. The
proposed dual-bit full adders based 32-bit RCAs incorporating redundant logic
feature reduced latency and area compared to their non-redundant counterparts
with no accompanying power penalty. In comparison with the weakly indicating
32-bit RCA constructed using homogeneously encoded dual-bit full adders
containing redundant logic, the early output 32-bit RCA comprising the proposed
homogeneously encoded dual-bit full adders with redundant logic reports
corresponding reductions in latency and area by 22.2% and 15.1% with no
associated power penalty. On the other hand, the early output 32-bit RCA
constructed using the proposed heterogeneously encoded dual-bit full adder
which incorporates redundant logic reports respective decreases in latency and
area than the weakly indicating 32-bit RCA that consists of heterogeneously
encoded dual-bit full adders with redundant logic by 21.5% and 21.3% with nil
power overhead. The simulation results obtained are based on a 32/28nm CMOS
process technology.

 <dc:description>  The proliferation of mobile Internet and connected devices, offering a
variety of services at different levels of performance, represents a major
challenge for the fifth generation wireless networks and beyond. This requires
a paradigm shift towards the development of key enabling techniques for the
next generation wireless networks. In this respect, visible light communication
(VLC) has recently emerged as a new communication paradigm that is capable of
providing ubiquitous connectivity by complementing radio frequency
communications. One of the main challenges of VLC systems, however, is the low
modulation bandwidth of the light-emitting-diodes, which is in the megahertz
range. This article presents a promising technology, referred to as &quot;optical-
non-orthogonal multiple access (O-NOMA)&quot;, which is envisioned to address the
key challenges in the next generation of wireless networks. We provide a
detailed overview and analysis of the state-of-the-art integration of O-NOMA in
VLC networks. Furthermore, we provide insights on the potential opportunities
and challenges as well as some open research problems that are envisioned to
pave the way for the future design and implementation of O-NOMA in VLC systems.

 <dc:title>Tapping the sensorimotor trajectory</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Berthold, Oswald</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Hafner, Verena</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose the concept of sensorimotor tappings, a new
graphical technique that explicitly represents relations between the time steps
of an agent's sensorimotor loop and a single training step of an adaptive
internal model. In the simplest case this is a relation linking two time steps.
In realistic cases these relations can extend over several time steps and over
different sensory channels. The aim is to capture the footprint of information
intake relative to the agent's current time step. We argue that this view
allows us to make prior considerations explicit and then use them in
implementations without modification once they are established.
  Here we explain the basic idea, provide example tappings for standard
configurations used in developmental models, and show how tappings can be
applied to problems in related fields.

 <dc:description>  We propose a simple, yet effective, approach towards inducing multilingual
taxonomies from Wikipedia. Given an English taxonomy, our approach leverages
the interlanguage links of Wikipedia followed by character-level classifiers to
induce high-precision, high-coverage taxonomies in other languages. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art, heuristics-heavy approaches for six languages. As a
consequence of our work, we release presumably the largest and the most
accurate multilingual taxonomic resource spanning over 280 languages.

 <dc:description>  In a \emph{weighted sequence}, for every position of the sequence and every
letter of the alphabet a probability of occurrence of this letter at this
position is specified. Weighted sequences are commonly used to represent
imprecise or uncertain data, for example, in molecular biology where they are
known under the name of Position-Weight Matrices. Given a probability threshold
$\frac1z$, we say that a string $P$ of length $m$ occurs in a weighted sequence
$X$ at position $i$ if the product of probabilities of the letters of $P$ at
positions $i,\ldots,i+m-1$ in $X$ is at least $\frac1z$. In this article, we
consider an \emph{indexing} variant of the problem, in which we are to
preprocess a weighted sequence to answer multiple pattern matching queries. We
present an $O(nz)$-time construction of an $O(nz)$-sized index for a weighted
sequence of length $n$ over a constant-sized alphabet that answers pattern
matching queries in optimal, $O(m+Occ)$ time, where $Occ$ is the number of
occurrences reported. The cornerstone of our data structure is a novel
construction of a family of $\lfloor z \rfloor$ special strings that carries
the information about all the strings that occur in the weighted sequence with
a sufficient probability. We obtain a weighted index with the same complexities
as in the most efficient previously known index by Barton et al. (CPM 2016),
but our construction is significantly simpler. The most complex algorithmic
tool required in the basic form of our index is the suffix tree which we use to
develop a new, more straightforward index for the so-called property matching
problem. We provide an implementation of our data structure. Our construction
allows us also to obtain a significant improvement over the complexities of the
approximate variant of the weighted index presented by Biswas et al. (EDBT
2016) and an improvement of the space complexity of their general index.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel, semi-supervised approach towards domain taxonomy
induction from an input vocabulary of seed terms. Unlike all previous
approaches, which typically extract direct hypernym edges for terms, our
approach utilizes a novel probabilistic framework to extract hypernym
subsequences. Taxonomy induction from extracted subsequences is cast as an
instance of the minimumcost flow problem on a carefully designed directed
graph. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms
stateof- the-art taxonomy induction approaches across four languages.
Importantly, we also show that our approach is robust to the presence of noise
in the input vocabulary. To the best of our knowledge, no previous approaches
have been empirically proven to manifest noise-robustness in the input
vocabulary.

 <dc:description>  Wireless surveillance is becoming increasingly important to protect the
public security by legitimately eavesdropping suspicious wireless
communications. This paper studies the wireless surveillance of a two-hop
suspicious communication link by a half-duplex legitimate monitor. By exploring
the suspicious link's two-hop nature, the monitor can adaptively choose among
the following three eavesdropping modes to improve the eavesdropping
performance: (I) \emph{passive eavesdropping} to intercept both hops to decode
the message collectively, (II) \emph{proactive eavesdropping} via {\emph{noise
jamming}} over the first hop, and (III) \emph{proactive eavesdropping} via
{\emph{hybrid jamming}} over the second hop. In both proactive eavesdropping
modes, the (noise/hybrid) jamming over one hop is for the purpose of reducing
the end-to-end communication rate of the suspicious link and accordingly making
the interception more easily over the other hop. Under this setup, we maximize
the eavesdropping rate at the monitor by jointly optimizing the eavesdropping
mode selection as well as the transmit power for noise and hybrid jamming.
Numerical results show that the eavesdropping mode selection significantly
improves the eavesdropping rate as compared to each individual eavesdropping
mode.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel method to jointly solve scene layout
estimation and global registration problems for accurate indoor 3D
reconstruction. Given a sequence of range data, we first build a set of scene
fragments using KinectFusion and register them through pose graph optimization.
Afterwards, we alternate between layout estimation and layout-based global
registration processes in iterative fashion to complement each other. We
extract the scene layout through hierarchical agglomerative clustering and
energy-based multi-model fitting in consideration of noisy measurements. Having
the estimated scene layout in one hand, we register all the range data through
the global iterative closest point algorithm where the positions of 3D points
that belong to the layout such as walls and a ceiling are constrained to be
close to the layout. We experimentally verify the proposed method with the
publicly available synthetic and real-world datasets in both quantitative and
qualitative ways.

 <dc:description>  We present an error-controlled mesh refinement procedure for needle insertion
simulation and apply it to the simulation of electrode implantation for deep
brain stimulation, including brain shift. Our approach enables to control the
error in the computation of the displacement and stress fields around the
needle tip and needle shaft by suitably refining the mesh, whilst maintaining a
coarser mesh in other parts of the domain. We demonstrate through academic and
practical examples that our approach increases the accuracy of the displacement
and stress fields around the needle without increasing the computational
expense. This enables real-time simulations. The proposed methodology has
direct implications to increase the accuracy and control the computational
expense of the simulation of percutaneous procedures such as biopsy,

 <dc:description>  We investigate the stability problem for discrete-time stochastic switched
linear systems under the specific scenarios where information about the
switching patterns and the probability of switches are not available. Our
analysis focuses on the average number of times each mode becomes active in the
long run and, in particular, utilizes their lower- and upper-bounds. This setup
is motivated by cyber security issues for networked control systems in the
presence of packet losses due to malicious jamming attacks where the attacker's
strategy is not known a priori. We derive a sufficient condition for almost
sure asymptotic stability of the switched systems which can be examined by
solving a linear programming problem. Our approach exploits the dynamics of an
equivalent system that describes the evolution of the switched system's state
at every few steps; the stability analysis may become less conservative by
increasing the step size. The computational efficiency is further enhanced by
exploiting the structure in the stability analysis problem, and we introduce an
alternative linear programming problem that has fewer variables. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our results by analyzing networked control problems where
communication channels face random packet losses as well as jamming attacks.

 <dc:title>Fast Space Optimal Leader Election in Population Protocols</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gasieniec, Leszek</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Stachowiak, Grzegorz</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The model of population protocols refers to the growing in popularity
theoretical framework suitable for studying pairwise interactions within a
large collection of simple indistinguishable entities, frequently called
agents. In this paper the emphasis is on the space complexity in fast leader
election via population protocols governed by the random scheduler, which
uniformly at random selects pairwise interactions within the population of n
agents.
  The main result of this paper is a new fast and space optimal leader election
protocol. The new protocol utilises O(log^2 n) parallel time (which is
equivalent to O(n log^2 n) sequential pairwise interactions), and each agent
operates on O(log log n) states. This double logarithmic space usage matches
asymptotically the lower bound 1/2 log log n on the minimal number of states
required by agents in any leader election algorithm with the running time
o(n/polylog n).
  Our solution takes an advantage of the concept of phase clocks, a fundamental
synchronisation and coordination tool in distributed computing. We propose a
new fast and robust population protocol for initialisation of phase clocks to
be run simultaneously in multiple modes and intertwined with the leader
election process. We also provide the reader with the relevant formal
argumentation indicating that our solution is always correct, and fast with
high probability.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Various modifications of decision trees have been extensively used during the
past years due to their high efficiency and interpretability. Tree node
splitting based on relevant feature selection is a key step of decision tree
learning, at the same time being their major shortcoming: the recursive nodes
partitioning leads to geometric reduction of data quantity in the leaf nodes,
which causes an excessive model complexity and data overfitting. In this paper,
we present a novel architecture - a Decision Stream, - aimed to overcome this
problem. Instead of building a tree structure during the learning process, we
propose merging nodes from different branches based on their similarity that is
estimated with two-sample test statistics, which leads to generation of a deep
directed acyclic graph of decision rules that can consist of hundreds of
levels. To evaluate the proposed solution, we test it on several common machine
learning problems - credit scoring, twitter sentiment analysis, aircraft flight
control, MNIST and CIFAR image classification, synthetic data classification
and regression. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed approach
significantly outperforms the standard decision tree learning methods on both
regression and classification tasks, yielding a prediction error decrease up to
35%.

 <dc:title>Graph Sampling for Covariance Estimation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chepuri, Sundeep Prabhakar</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Leus, Geert</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper the focus is on subsampling as well as reconstructing the
second-order statistics of signals residing on nodes of arbitrary undirected
graphs. Second-order stationary graph signals may be obtained by graph
filtering zero-mean white noise and they admit a well-defined power spectrum
whose shape is determined by the frequency response of the graph filter.
Estimating the graph power spectrum forms an important component of stationary
graph signal processing and related inference tasks such as Wiener prediction
or inpainting on graphs. The central result of this paper is that by sampling a
significantly smaller subset of vertices and using simple least squares, we can
reconstruct the second-order statistics of the graph signal from the subsampled
observations, and more importantly, without any spectral priors. To this end,
both a nonparametric approach as well as parametric approaches including moving
average and autoregressive models for the graph power spectrum are considered.
The results specialize for undirected circulant graphs in that the graph nodes
leading to the best compression rates are given by the so-called minimal sparse
rulers. A near-optimal greedy algorithm is developed to design the subsampling
scheme for the non-parametric and the moving average models, whereas a
particular subsampling scheme that allows linear estimation for the
autoregressive model is proposed. Numerical experiments on synthetic as well as
real datasets related to climatology and processing handwritten digits are
provided to demonstrate the developed theory.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we have discussed a quantum approach for the all-pair
multiclass classification problem. We have shown that the multiclass support
vector machine for big data classification with a quantum all-pair approach can
be implemented in logarithm time complexity on a quantum computer. In an
all-pair approach, there is one binary classification problem for each pair of
classes, and so there are k (k-1)/2 classifiers for a k-class problem. As
compared to the classical multiclass support vector machine that can be
implemented with polynomial time complexity, our approach exhibits exponential
speed up in the quantum version. The quantum all-pair algorithm can be used
with other classification algorithms, and a speed up gain can be achieved as
compared to their classical counterparts.

 <dc:description>  Principal component analysis (PCA) is a fundamental dimension reduction tool
in statistics and machine learning. For large and high-dimensional data,
computing the PCA (i.e., the singular vectors corresponding to a number of
dominant singular values of the data matrix) becomes a challenging task. In
this work, a single-pass randomized algorithm is proposed to compute PCA with
only one pass over the data. It is suitable for processing extremely large and
high-dimensional data stored in slow memory (hard disk) or the data generated
in a streaming fashion. Experiments with synthetic and real data validate the
algorithm's accuracy, which has orders of magnitude smaller error than an
existing single-pass algorithm. For a set of high-dimensional data stored as a
150 GB file, the proposed algorithm is able to compute the first 50 principal
components in just 24 minutes on a typical 24-core computer, with less than 1
GB memory cost.

 <dc:description>  A pseudocircle is a simple closed curve on some surface. Arrangements of
pseudocircles were introduced by Gr\&quot;unbaum, who defined them as collections of
pseudocircles that pairwise intersect in exactly two points, at which they
cross. There are several variations on this notion in the literature, one of
which requires that no three pseudocircles have a point in common. Working
under this definition, Ortner proved that an arrangement of pseudocircles is
embeddable into the sphere if and only if all of its subarrangements of size at
most $4$ are embeddable into the sphere. Ortner asked if an analogous result
held for embeddability into a compact orientable surface $\Sigma_g$ of genus
$g&gt;0$. In this paper we answer this question, under an even more general
definition of an arrangement, in which the pseudocircles in the collection are
not required to intersect each other, or that the intersections are crossings:
it suffices to have one pseudocircle that intersects all other pseudocircles in
the collection. We show that under this more general notion, an arrangement of
pseudocircles is embeddable into $\Sigma_g$ if and only if all of its
subarrangements of size at most $4g+5$ are embeddable into $\Sigma_g$, and that
this can be improved to $4g+4$ under the concept of an arrangement used by
Ortner. Our framework also allows us to generalize this result to arrangements
of other objects, such as arcs.

 <dc:description>  We study a lossy source coding problem for a memoryless remote source. The
source data is broadcast over an arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) controlled
by an adversary. One output of the AVC is received as input at the encoder, and
another output is received as side information at the decoder. The adversary is
assumed to know the source data non-causally, and can employ randomized jamming
strategies arbitrarily correlated to the source data. The decoder reconstructs
the source data from the encoded message and the side information. We prove
upper and lower bounds on the adversarial rate distortion function for the
source under randomized coding. Furthermore, we present some interesting
special cases of our general setup where the above bounds coincide, and thus,
provide their complete rate distortion function characterization.

 <dc:description>  Perivascular Spaces (PVS) are a recently recognised feature of Small Vessel
Disease (SVD), also indicating neuroinflammation, and are an important part of
the brain's circulation and glymphatic drainage system. Quantitative analysis
of PVS on Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is important for understanding their
relationship with neurological diseases. In this work, we propose a
segmentation technique based on the 3D Frangi filtering for extraction of PVS
from MRI. Based on prior knowledge from neuroradiological ratings of PVS, we
used ordered logit models to optimise Frangi filter parameters in response to
the variability in the scanner's parameters and study protocols. We optimized
and validated our proposed models on two independent cohorts, a dementia sample
(N=20) and patients who previously had mild to moderate stroke (N=48). Results
demonstrate the robustness and generalisability of our segmentation method.
Segmentation-based PVS burden estimates correlated with neuroradiological
assessments (Spearman's $\rho$ = 0.74, p $&lt;$ 0.001), suggesting the great
potential of our proposed method

 <dc:description>  Performance and high availability have become increasingly important drivers,
amongst other drivers, for user retention in the context of web services such
as social networks, and web search. Exogenic and/or endogenic factors often
give rise to anomalies, making it very challenging to maintain high
availability, while also delivering high performance. Given that
service-oriented architectures (SOA) typically have a large number of services,
with each service having a large set of metrics, automatic detection of
anomalies is non-trivial.
  Although there exists a large body of prior research in anomaly detection,
existing techniques are not applicable in the context of social network data,
owing to the inherent seasonal and trend components in the time series data.
  To this end, we developed two novel statistical techniques for automatically
detecting anomalies in cloud infrastructure data. Specifically, the techniques
employ statistical learning to detect anomalies in both application, and system
metrics. Seasonal decomposition is employed to filter the trend and seasonal
components of the time series, followed by the use of robust statistical
metrics -- median and median absolute deviation (MAD) -- to accurately detect
anomalies, even in the presence of seasonal spikes.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques from three different
perspectives, viz., capacity planning, user behavior, and supervised learning.
In particular, we used production data for evaluation, and we report Precision,
Recall, and F-measure in each case.

 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are an influential tool for
solving various problems in the machine learning and computer vision fields. In
this paper, we introduce a new deep learning model called an Inception-
Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (IRCNN), which utilizes the power of an
inception network combined with recurrent layers in DCNN architecture. We have
empirically evaluated the recognition performance of the proposed IRCNN model
using different benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR- 100, and
SVHN. Experimental results show similar or higher recognition accuracy when
compared to most of the popular DCNNs including the RCNN. Furthermore, we have
investigated IRCNN performance against equivalent Inception Networks and
Inception-Residual Networks using the CIFAR-100 dataset. We report about 3.5%,
3.47% and 2.54% improvement in classification accuracy when compared to the
RCNN, equivalent Inception Networks, and Inception- Residual Networks on the
augmented CIFAR- 100 dataset respectively.

 <dc:title>Succinct Approximate Rank Queries</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Basat, Ran Ben</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of summarizing a multi set of elements in $\{1, 2,
\ldots , n\}$ under the constraint that no element appears more than $\ell$
times. The goal is then to answer \emph{rank} queries --- given $i\in\{1, 2,
\ldots , n\}$, how many elements in the multi set are smaller than $i$? ---
with an additive error of at most $\Delta$ and in constant time. For this
problem, we prove a lower bound of $\mathcal B_{\ell,n,\Delta}\triangleq$
$\left\lfloor{\frac{n}{\left\lceil{\Delta / \ell}\right\rceil}}\right\rfloor $
$\log\big({\max\{\left\lfloor{\ell / \Delta}\right\rfloor,1\} + 1}\big)$ bits
and provide a \emph{succinct} construction that uses $\mathcal
B_{\ell,n,\Delta}(1+o(1))$ bits. Next, we generalize our data structure to
support processing of a stream of integers in $\{0,1,\ldots,\ell\}$, where upon
a query for some $i\le n$ we provide a $\Delta$-additive approximation for the
sum of the \emph{last} $i$ elements. We show that this too can be done using
$\mathcal B_{\ell,n,\Delta}(1+o(1))$ bits and in constant time. This yields the
first sub linear space algorithm that computes approximate sliding window sums
in $O(1)$ time, where the window size is given at the query time; additionally,
it requires only $(1+o(1))$ more space than is needed for a fixed window size.

 <dc:title>Masked Signal Decomposition Using Subspace Representation and Its
  Applications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Minaee, Shervin</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Signal decomposition is a classical problem in signal processing, which aims
to separate an observed signal into two or more components each with its own
property. Usually each component is described by its own subspace or
dictionary. Extensive research has been done for the case where the components
are additive, but in real world applications, the components are often
non-additive. For example, an image may consist of a foreground object overlaid
on a background, where each pixel either belongs to the foreground or the
background. In such a situation, to separate signal components, we need to find
a binary mask which shows the location of each component. Therefore it requires
to solve a binary optimization problem. Since most of the binary optimization
problems are intractable, we relax this problem to the approximated continuous
problem, and solve it by alternating optimization technique, which solves the
mask and the subspace projection for each component, alternatingly and
iteratively. We show the application of the proposed algorithm for three
applications: separation of text from background in images, separation of
moving objects from a background undergoing global camera motion in videos,
separation of sinusoidal and spike components in one dimensional signals. We
demonstrate in each case that considering the non-additive nature of the
problem can lead to significant improvement.

 <dc:description>  Model-based prediction of stochastic noise in biomolecular reactions often
resorts to approximation with unknown precision. As a result, unexpected
stochastic fluctuation causes a headache for the designers of biomolecular
circuits. This paper proposes a convex optimization approach to quantifying the
steady state moments of molecular copy counts with theoretical rigor. We show
that the stochastic moments lie in a convex semi-algebraic set specified by
linear matrix inequalities. Thus, the upper and the lower bounds of some
moments can be computed by a semidefinite program. Using a protein dimerization
process as an example, we demonstrate that the proposed method can precisely
predict the mean and the variance of the copy number of the monomer protein.

 <dc:description>  Rectifier neuron units (ReLUs) have been widely used in deep convolutional
networks. An ReLU converts negative values to zeros, and does not change
positive values, which leads to a high sparsity of neurons. In this work, we
first examine the sparsity of the outputs of ReLUs in some popular deep
convolutional architectures. And then we use the sparsity property of ReLUs to
accelerate the calculation of convolution by skipping calculations of
zero-valued neurons. The proposed sparse convolution algorithm achieves some
speedup improvements on CPUs compared to the traditional matrix-matrix
multiplication algorithm for convolution when the sparsity is not less than
0.9.

 <dc:title>Low-Dimensional Spatial Embedding Method for Shape Uncertainty
  Quantification in Acoustic Scattering</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Harness, Yuval</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel boundary integral approach of shape uncertainty
quantification for the Helmholtz scattering problem in the framework of the
so-called parametric method. The key idea is to form a low-dimensional spatial
embedding within the family of uncertain boundary deformations via the Coarea
formula. The embedding, essentially, encompasses any irregular behavior of the
boundary deformations and facilitates a low-dimensional integration rule
capturing the bulk variation of output functionals defined on the boundary. In
a second phase a matching parametric grid is imposed. For the ease of
presentation the theory is restricted to 2D star-shaped obstacles in
low-dimensional setting. We employ the null-field reconstruction technique
which is capable of handling large shape deformations. Higher spatial and
parametric dimensional cases are discussed, though, not extensively explored in
the current study.

 <dc:description>  The Kundu-Eckhaus equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation which
seems in the quantum field theory, weakly nonlinear dispersive water waves and
nonlinear optics. In spite of its importance, exact solution to this nonlinear
equation are rarely found in literature. In this work, we solve this equation
and present a new approach to obtain the solution by means of the combined use
of the Adomian Decomposition Method and the Laplace Transform (LADM). Besides,
we compare the behaviour of the solutions obtained with the only exact
solutions given in the literature through fractional calculus. Moreover, it is
shown that the proposed method is direct, effective and can be used for many
other nonlinear evolution equations in mathematical physics.

 <dc:description>  Computer programs written in one language are often required to be ported to
other languages to support multiple devices and environments. When programs use
language specific APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), it is very
challenging to migrate these APIs to the corresponding APIs written in other
languages. Existing approaches mine API mappings from projects that have
corresponding versions in two languages. They rely on the sparse availability
of bilingual projects, thus producing a limited number of API mappings. In this
paper, we propose an intelligent system called DeepAM for automatically mining
API mappings from a large-scale code corpus without bilingual projects. The key
component of DeepAM is based on the multimodal sequence to sequence learning
architecture that aims to learn joint semantic representations of bilingual API
sequences from big source code data. Experimental results indicate that DeepAM
significantly increases the accuracy of API mappings as well as the number of
API mappings, when compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate secure transmission over the large-scale
multiple-antenna wiretap channel with finite alphabet inputs. First, we
investigate the case where instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the
eavesdropper is known at the transmitter. We show analytically that a
generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) based design, which is optimal
for Gaussian inputs, may exhibit a severe performance loss for finite alphabet
inputs in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. In light of this, we
propose a novel Per-Group-GSVD (PG-GSVD) design which can effectively
compensate the performance loss caused by the GSVD design. More importantly,
the computational complexity of the PG-GSVD design is by orders of magnitude
lower than that of the existing design for finite alphabet inputs in [1] while
the resulting performance loss is minimal. Then, we extend the PG-GSVD design
to the case where only statistical CSI of the eavesdropper is available at the
transmitter. Numerical results indicate that the proposed PG-GSVD design can be
efficiently implemented in large-scale multiple-antenna systems and achieves
significant performance gains compared to the GSVD design.

 <dc:description>  As entity type systems become richer and more fine-grained, we expect the
number of types assigned to a given entity to increase. However, most
fine-grained typing work has focused on datasets that exhibit a low degree of
type multiplicity. In this paper, we consider the high-multiplicity regime
inherent in data sources such as Wikipedia that have semi-open type systems. We
introduce a set-prediction approach to this problem and show that our model
outperforms unstructured baselines on a new Wikipedia-based fine-grained typing
corpus.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning models such as convolutional neural net- work have been widely
used in 3D biomedical segmentation and achieve state-of-the-art performance.
However, most of them often adapt a single modality or stack multiple
modalities as different input channels. To better leverage the multi-
modalities, we propose a deep encoder-decoder structure with cross-modality
convolution layers to incorporate different modalities of MRI data. In
addition, we exploit convolutional LSTM to model a sequence of 2D slices, and
jointly learn the multi-modalities and convolutional LSTM in an end-to-end
manner. To avoid converging to the certain labels, we adopt a re-weighting
scheme and two-phase training to handle the label imbalance. Experimental
results on BRATS-2015 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
biomedical segmentation approaches.

 <dc:description>  We set out to understand the effects of differing language on the ability of
cybercriminals to navigate webmail accounts and locate sensitive information in
them. To this end, we configured thirty Gmail honeypot accounts with English,
Romanian, and Greek language settings. We populated the accounts with email
messages in those languages by subscribing them to selected online newsletters.
We hid email messages about fake bank accounts in fifteen of the accounts to
mimic real-world webmail users that sometimes store sensitive information in
their accounts. We then leaked credentials to the honey accounts via paste
sites on the Surface Web and the Dark Web, and collected data for fifteen days.
Our statistical analyses on the data show that cybercriminals are more likely
to discover sensitive information (bank account information) in the Greek
accounts than the remaining accounts, contrary to the expectation that Greek
ought to constitute a barrier to the understanding of non-Greek visitors to the
Greek accounts. We also extracted the important words among the emails that
cybercriminals accessed (as an approximation of the keywords that they searched
for within the honey accounts), and found that financial terms featured among
the top words. In summary, we show that language plays a significant role in
the ability of cybercriminals to access sensitive information hidden in
compromised webmail accounts.

 <dc:title>Low-Complexity Robust MISO Downlink Precoder Design With Per-Antenna
  Power Constraints</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Medra, Mostafa</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Davidson, Timothy N.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers the design of the beamformers for a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) downlink system that seeks to mitigate the impact of the
imperfections in the channel state information (CSI) that is available at the
base station (BS). The goal of the design is to minimize the outage probability
of specified signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) targets, while
satisfying per-antenna power constraints (PAPCs), and to do so at a low
computational cost. Based on insights from the offset maximization technique
for robust beamforming, and observations regarding the structure of the
optimality conditions, low-complexity iterative algorithms that involve the
evaluation of closed-form expressions are developed. To further reduce the
computational cost, algorithms are developed for per-antenna power-constrained
variants of the zero-forcing (ZF) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT)
beamforming directions. In the MRT case, our low-complexity version for systems
with a large number of antennas may be of independent interest. The proposed
algorithms are extended to systems with both PAPCs and a total power
constraint. Simulation results show that the proposed robust designs can
provide substantial gains in the outage probability while satisfying the PAPCs.

 <dc:title>A lower bound on the differential entropy of log-concave random vectors

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We derive a lower bound on the differential entropy of a log-concave random
variable $X$ in terms of the $p$-th absolute moment of $X$. The new bound leads
to a reverse entropy power inequality with an explicit constant, and to new
bounds on the rate-distortion function and the channel capacity.
  Specifically, we study the rate-distortion function for log-concave sources
and distortion measure $| x - \hat x|^r$, and we establish that the difference
between the rate distortion function and the Shannon lower bound is at most
$\log(\sqrt{\pi e}) \approx 1.5$ bits, independently of $r$ and the target
distortion $d$. For mean-square error distortion, the difference is at most
$\log (\sqrt{\frac{\pi e}{2}}) \approx 1$ bits, regardless of $d$.
  We also provide bounds on the capacity of memoryless additive noise channels
when the noise is log-concave. We show that the difference between the capacity
of such channels and the capacity of the Gaussian channel with the same noise
power is at most $\log (\sqrt{\frac{\pi e}{2}}) \approx 1$ bits.
  Our results generalize to the case of vector $X$ with possibly dependent
coordinates, and to $\gamma$-concave random variables. Our proof technique
leverages tools from convex geometry.

 <dc:description>  The origin of population-scale coordination has puzzled philosophers and
scientists for centuries. Recently, game theory, evolutionary approaches and
complex systems science have provided quantitative insights on the mechanisms
of social consensus. However, the literature is vast and scattered widely
across fields, making it hard for the single researcher to navigate it. This
short review aims to provide a compact overview of the main dimensions over
which the debate has unfolded and to discuss some representative examples. It
focuses on those situations in which consensus emerges 'spontaneously' in
absence of centralised institutions and covers topic that include the
macroscopic consequences of the different microscopic rules of behavioural
contagion, the role of social networks, and the mechanisms that prevent the
formation of a consensus or alter it after it has emerged. Special attention is
devoted to the recent wave of experiments on the emergence of consensus in
social systems.

 <dc:description>  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) on Electronic Health Records (EHR) data is
widely-used for early detection of diseases. Classical LDA for EHR data
classification, however, suffers from two handicaps: the ill-posed estimation
of LDA parameters (e.g., covariance matrix), and the &quot;linear inseparability&quot; of
EHR data. To handle these two issues, in this paper, we propose a novel
classifier FWDA -- Fast Wishart Discriminant Analysis, that makes predictions
in an ensemble way. Specifically, FWDA first surrogates the distribution of
inverse covariance matrices using a Wishart distribution estimated from the
training data, then &quot;weighted-averages&quot; the classification results of multiple
LDA classifiers parameterized by the sampled inverse covariance matrices via a
Bayesian Voting scheme. The weights for voting are optimally updated to adapt
each new input data, so as to enable the nonlinear classification. Theoretical
analysis indicates that FWDA possesses a fast convergence rate and a robust
performance on high dimensional data. Extensive experiments on large-scale EHR
dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by a
large margin.

 <dc:description>  Small depth networks arise in a variety of network related applications,
often in the form of maximum flow and maximum weighted matching. Recent works
have generalized such methods to include costs arising from concave functions.
In this paper we give an algorithm that takes a depth $D$ network and strictly
increasing concave weight functions of flows on the edges and computes a $(1 -
\epsilon)$-approximation to the maximum weight flow in time $mD \epsilon^{-1}$
times an overhead that is logarithmic in the various numerical parameters
related to the magnitudes of gradients and capacities.
  Our approach is based on extending the scaling algorithm for approximate
maximum weighted matchings by [Duan-Pettie JACM`14] to the setting of small
depth networks, and then generalizing it to concave functions. In this more
restricted setting of linear weights in the range $[w_{\min}, w_{\max}]$, it
produces a $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation in time $O(mD \epsilon^{-1} \log(
w_{\max} /w_{\min}))$. The algorithm combines a variety of tools and provides a
unified approach towards several problems involving small depth networks.

 <dc:description>  Arabidopsis thaliana is a plant species widely utilized by scientists to
estimate the impact of genetic differences in root morphological features. For
this purpose, images of this plant after genetic modifications are taken to
study differences in the root architecture. This task requires manual
segmentations of radicular structures, although this is a particularly tedious
and time-consuming labor. In this work, we present an unsupervised method for
Arabidopsis thaliana root segmentation based on morphological operations and
fully-connected Conditional Random Fields. Although other approaches have been
proposed to this purpose, all of them are based on more complex and expensive
imaging modalities. Our results prove that our method can be easily applied
over images taken using conventional scanners, with a minor user intervention.
A first data set, our results and a fully open source implementation are
available online.

 <dc:title>Limitations on Transversal Computation through Quantum Homomorphic
  Encryption</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Transversality is a simple and effective method for implementing quantum
computation fault-tolerantly. However, no quantum error-correcting code (QECC)
can transversally implement a quantum universal gate set (Eastin and Knill,
Phys. Rev. Lett., 102, 110502). Since reversible classical computation is often
a dominating part of useful quantum computation, whether or not it can be
implemented transversally is an important open problem. We show that, other
than a small set of non-additive codes that we cannot rule out, no binary QECC
can transversally implement a classical reversible universal gate set. In
particular, no such QECC can implement the Toffoli gate transversally.
  We prove our result by constructing an information theoretically secure (but
inefficient) quantum homomorphic encryption (ITS-QHE) scheme inspired by Ouyang
et al. (arXiv:1508.00938). Homomorphic encryption allows the implementation of
certain functions directly on encrypted data, i.e. homomorphically. Our scheme
builds on almost any QECC, and implements that code's transversal gate set
homomorphically. We observe a restriction imposed by Nayak's bound (FOCS 1999)
on ITS-QHE, implying that any ITS quantum fully homomorphic scheme (ITS-QFHE)
implementing the full set of classical reversible functions must be highly
inefficient. While our scheme incurs exponential overhead, any such QECC
implementing Toffoli transversally would still violate this lower bound through
our scheme.

 <dc:description>  We propose SfM-Net, a geometry-aware neural network for motion estimation in
videos that decomposes frame-to-frame pixel motion in terms of scene and object
depth, camera motion and 3D object rotations and translations. Given a sequence
of frames, SfM-Net predicts depth, segmentation, camera and rigid object
motions, converts those into a dense frame-to-frame motion field (optical
flow), differentiably warps frames in time to match pixels and back-propagates.
The model can be trained with various degrees of supervision: 1)
self-supervised by the re-projection photometric error (completely
unsupervised), 2) supervised by ego-motion (camera motion), or 3) supervised by
depth (e.g., as provided by RGBD sensors). SfM-Net extracts meaningful depth
estimates and successfully estimates frame-to-frame camera rotations and
translations. It often successfully segments the moving objects in the scene,
even though such supervision is never provided.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of decentralized optimization with a
composite objective containing smooth and non-smooth terms. To solve the
problem, a proximal-gradient scheme is studied. Specifically, the smooth and
nonsmooth terms are dealt with by gradient update and proximal update,
respectively. The studied algorithm is closely related to a previous
decentralized optimization algorithm, PG-EXTRA [37], but has a few advantages.
First of all, in our new scheme, agents use uncoordinated step-sizes and the
stable upper bounds on step-sizes are independent from network topology. The
step-sizes depend on local objective functions, and they can be as large as
that of the gradient descent. Secondly, for the special case without non-smooth
terms, linear convergence can be achieved under the strong convexity
assumption. The dependence of the convergence rate on the objective functions
and the network are separated, and the convergence rate of our new scheme is as
good as one of the two convergence rates that match the typical rates for the
general gradient descent and the consensus averaging. We also provide some
numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the introduced algorithms
and validate our theoretical discoveries.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach that uses a multi-camera system to train fine-grained
detectors for keypoints that are prone to occlusion, such as the joints of a
hand. We call this procedure multiview bootstrapping: first, an initial
keypoint detector is used to produce noisy labels in multiple views of the
hand. The noisy detections are then triangulated in 3D using multiview geometry
or marked as outliers. Finally, the reprojected triangulations are used as new
labeled training data to improve the detector. We repeat this process,
generating more labeled data in each iteration. We derive a result analytically
relating the minimum number of views to achieve target true and false positive
rates for a given detector. The method is used to train a hand keypoint
detector for single images. The resulting keypoint detector runs in realtime on
RGB images and has accuracy comparable to methods that use depth sensors. The
single view detector, triangulated over multiple views, enables 3D markerless
hand motion capture with complex object interactions.

 <dc:description>  We present an unsupervised learning framework for the task of monocular depth

by simultaneously training depth and camera pose estimation networks using the
task of view synthesis as the supervisory signal. The networks are thus coupled
via the view synthesis objective during training, but can be applied
independently at test time. Empirical evaluation on the KITTI dataset
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach: 1) monocular depth performing
comparably with supervised methods that use either ground-truth pose or depth
for training, and 2) pose estimation performing favorably with established SLAM
systems under comparable input settings.

 <dc:description>  We propose introspective convolutional networks (ICN) that emphasize the
importance of having convolutional neural networks empowered with generative
capabilities. We employ a reclassification-by-synthesis algorithm to perform
training using a formulation stemmed from the Bayes theory. Our ICN tries to
iteratively: (1) synthesize pseudo-negative samples; and (2) enhance itself by
improving the classification. The single CNN classifier learned is at the same
time generative --- being able to directly synthesize new samples within its
own discriminative model. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets
including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN using state-of-the-art CNN architectures,
and observe improved classification results.

 <dc:description>  We study unsupervised learning by developing introspective generative
modeling (IGM) that attains a generator using progressively learned deep
convolutional neural networks. The generator is itself a discriminator, capable
of introspection: being able to self-evaluate the difference between its
generated samples and the given training data. When followed by repeated
discriminative learning, desirable properties of modern discriminative
classifiers are directly inherited by the generator. IGM learns a cascade of
CNN classifiers using a synthesis-by-classification algorithm. In the
experiments, we observe encouraging results on a number of applications
including texture modeling, artistic style transferring, face modeling, and
semi-supervised learning.

in big cities and that there is a superlinear relationship between the people's
movement and crime, this article aims to evaluate the impact of how these
findings influence police allocation. More precisely, we shed light on the
differences between an allocation strategy, in which the resources are
distributed by clusters of floating population, and conventional allocation
strategies, in which the police resources are distributed by an Administrative
Area (typically based on resident population). We observed a substantial
difference in the distributions of police resources allocated following these
strategies, what evidences the imprecision of conventional police allocation
methods.

 <dc:description>  Understanding how ideas relate to each other is a fundamental question in
many domains, ranging from intellectual history to public communication.
Because ideas are naturally embedded in texts, we propose the first framework
to systematically characterize the relations between ideas based on their
occurrence in a corpus of documents, independent of how these ideas are
represented. Combining two statistics --- cooccurrence within documents and
prevalence correlation over time --- our approach reveals a number of different
ways in which ideas can cooperate and compete. For instance, two ideas can
closely track each other's prevalence over time, and yet rarely cooccur, almost
like a &quot;cold war&quot; scenario. We observe that pairwise cooccurrence and
prevalence correlation exhibit different distributions. We further demonstrate
that our approach is able to uncover intriguing relations between ideas through
in-depth case studies on news articles and research papers.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of querying a string (or, a database) of length $N$
bits to determine all the locations where a substring (query) of length $M$
appears either exactly or is within a Hamming distance of $K$ from the query.
We assume that sketches of the original signal can be computed off line and
stored. Using the sparse Fourier transform computation based approach
introduced by Pawar and Ramchandran, we show that all such matches can be
determined with high probability in sub-linear time. Specifically, if the query
length $M = O(N^\mu)$ and the number of matches $L=O(N^\lambda)$, we show that
for $\lambda &lt; 1-\mu$ all the matching positions can be determined with a
probability that approaches 1 as $N \rightarrow \infty$ for $K \leq
\frac{1}{6}M$. More importantly our scheme has a worst-case computational
complexity that is only $O\left(\max\{N^{1-\mu}\log^2 N, N^{\mu+\lambda}\log N
\}\right)$, which means we can recover all the matching positions in {\it
sub-linear} time for $\lambda&lt;1-\mu$. This is a substantial improvement over
the best known computational complexity of $O\left(N^{1-0.359 \mu} \right)$ for
recovering one matching position by Andoni {\em et al.} \cite{andoni2013shift}.
Further, the number of Fourier transform coefficients that need to be computed,
stored and accessed, i.e., the sketching complexity of this algorithm is only
$O\left(N^{1-\mu}\log N\right)$. Several extensions of the main theme are also
discussed.

 <dc:description>  Liquids exhibit highly complex, non-linear behavior under changing simulation
conditions such as user interactions. We propose a method to map this complex
behavior over a parameter range onto a reduced representation based on
space-time deformations. In order to represent the complexity of the full space
of inputs, we use deformations from optical flow solves with an improved
alignment procedure, and we leverage the power of generative neural networks to
synthesize additional deformations for refinement. We introduce a novel
deformation-aware loss function, which enables optimization in the highly
non-linear space of multiple deformations.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we showcase the method with
several complex examples in two and four dimensions. Our representation makes
it possible to rapidly generate implicit surfaces of liquids, which allows us
to very efficiently display the scene from any angle, and to add secondary
effects such as splash and foam particles. We have implemented a mobile
application with our full pipeline to demonstrate that real-time interactions
with complex liquid effects are possible with our approach. Our app yields
effective speed-ups of several orders of magnitude compared to a regular
simulation.

 <dc:title>Separability by Piecewise Testable Languages is PTime-Complete</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Piecewise testable languages form the first level of the Straubing-Th\'erien
hierarchy. The membership problem for this level is decidable and testing if
the language of a DFA is piecewise testable is NL-complete. The question has
not yet been addressed for NFAs. We fill in this gap by showing that it is
PSpace-complete. The main result is then the lower-bound complexity of
separability of regular languages by piecewise testable languages. Two regular
languages are separable by a piecewise testable language if the piecewise
testable language includes one of them and is disjoint from the other. For
languages represented by NFAs, separability by piecewise testable languages is
known to be decidable in PTime. We show that it is PTime-hard and that it
remains PTime-hard even for minimal DFAs.

 <dc:title>Grouping-Based Random Access Collision Control for Massive Machine-Type
  Communication</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Han, Bin</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) is expected to be strongly
supported by future 5G wireless networks. Its deployment, however, is seriously
challenged by the high risk of random access (RA) collision. A popular concept
is to reduce RA collisions by clustering mMTC devices into groups, and to
connect group members with device-to-device (D2D) links. However, analytical
models of this method and discussions about the reliability of D2D links are
still absent. In this paper, existing grouping-based solutions are reviewed, an
analytical model of grouped RA collision is proposed. Based on the analytical
model, the impact of D2D reliability on the collision rate is also
investigated. Afterwards, an efficient grouped RA procedure is designed to
extend the state-of-the-art with an efficient local group update mechanism
against D2D link exceptions.

 <dc:title>Universality of Confluent, Self-Loop Deterministic Partially Ordered
  NFAs is Hard</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Masopust, Tom&#xe1;&#x161;</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An automaton is partially ordered if the only cycles in its transition
diagram are self-loops. The expressivity of partially ordered NFAs (poNFAs) can
be characterized by the Straubing-Th\'erien hierarchy. Level 3/2 is recognized
by poNFAs, level 1 by confluent, self-loop deterministic poNFAs as well as by
confluent poDFAs, and level 1/2 by saturated poNFAs. We study the universality
problem for confluent, self-loop deterministic poNFAs. It asks whether an
automaton accepts all words over its alphabet. Universality for both NFAs and
poNFAs is a PSpace-complete problem. For confluent, self-loop deterministic
poNFAs, the complexity drops to coNP-complete if the alphabet is fixed but is
open if the alphabet may grow. We solve this problem by showing that it is
PSpace-complete if the alphabet may grow polynomially. Consequently, our result
provides a lower-bound complexity for some other problems, including inclusion,
equivalence, and $k$-piecewise testability. Since universality for saturated
poNFAs is easy, confluent, self-loop deterministic poNFAs are the simplest and
natural kind of NFAs characterizing a well-known class of languages, for which
deciding universality is as difficult as for general NFAs.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel convolutional neural network architecture to address the
fine-grained recognition problem of multi-view dynamic facial action unit
detection. We leverage recent gains in large-scale object recognition by
formulating the task of predicting the presence or absence of a specific action
unit in a still image of a human face as holistic classification. We then
explore the design space of our approach by considering both shared and
independent representations for separate action units, and also different CNN
architectures for combining color and motion information. We then move to the
novel setup of the FERA 2017 Challenge, in which we propose a multi-view
extension of our approach that operates by first predicting the viewpoint from
which the video was taken, and then evaluating an ensemble of action unit
detectors that were trained for that specific viewpoint. Our approach is
holistic, efficient, and modular, since new action units can be easily included
in the overall system. Our approach significantly outperforms the baseline of
the FERA 2017 Challenge, which was the previous state-of-the-art in multi-view
dynamic action unit detection, with an absolute improvement of 14%.

 <dc:description>  Compositor attribution, the clustering of pages in a historical printed

relies on analysis of orthographic variation and inspection of visual details
of the printed page. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised model
that jointly describes the textual and visual features needed to distinguish

attributions that agree with the manual judgements of bibliographers with an
accuracy of 87%, even on text that is the output of OCR.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Security and energy are considered as the most important parameters for
designing and building a computing system nowadays. Today's attacks target
different layers of the computing system (i.e. software and hardware).
Introduction of new transistor technologies to the integrated circuits design
is beneficial, especially for low energy requirements. The new devices have
unique features and properties that provide security advantages. However, these
properties may come to the aid of an adversary to design stronger attacks.
Therefore, the advantages as well as the disadvantages of these technologies
need to be well studied. This paper demonstrates the area and power efficiency
of the tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) technology along with analyzing
its security aspects.

 <dc:description>  Most of the codes that have an algebraic decoding algorithm are derived from
the Reed Solomon codes. They are obtained by taking equivalent codes, for
example the generalized Reed Solomon codes, or by using the so-called subfield
subcode method, which leads to Alternant codes and Goppa codes over the
underlying prime field, or over some intermediate subfield. The main advantages
of these constructions is to preserve both the minimum distance and the
decoding algorithm of the underlying Reed Solomon code. In this paper, we
propose a generalization of the subfield subcode construction by introducing
the notion of subspace subcodes and a generalization of the equivalence of
codes which leads to the notion of generalized subspace subcodes. When the
dimension of the selected subspaces is equal to one, we show that our approach
gives exactly the family of the codes obtained by equivalence and subfield
subcode technique. However, our approach highlights the links between the
subfield subcode of a code defined over an extension field and the operation of
puncturing the $q$-ary image of this code. When the dimension of the subspaces
is greater than one, we obtain codes whose alphabet is no longer a finite
field, but a set of r-uples. We explain why these codes are practically as
efficient for applications as the codes defined on an extension of degree r. In
addition, they make it possible to obtain decodable codes over a large alphabet
having parameters previously inaccessible. As an application, we give some
examples that can be used in public key cryptosystems such as McEliece.

 <dc:description>  The computability power of a distributed computing model is determined by the
communication media available to the processes, the timing assumptions about
processes and communication, and the nature of failures that processes can
suffer. In a companion paper we showed how dynamic epistemic logic can be used
to give a formal semantics to a given distributed computing model, to capture
precisely the knowledge needed to solve a distributed task, such as consensus.
Furthermore, by moving to a dual model of epistemic logic defined by simplicial
complexes, topological invariants are exposed, which determine task
solvability. In this paper we show how to extend the setting above to include
in the knowledge of the processes, knowledge about the model of computation
itself. The extension describes the knowledge processes gain about the current
execution, in problems where processes have no input values at all.

 <dc:description>  Many real-world communication networks often have hybrid nature with both
fixed nodes and moving modes, such as the mobile phone networks mainly composed
of fixed base stations and mobile phones. In this paper, we discuss the
information transmission process on the hybrid networks with both fixed and
mobile nodes. The fixed nodes (base stations) are connected as a spatial
lattice on the plane forming the information-carrying backbone, while the
mobile nodes (users), which are the sources and destinations of information
packets, connect to their current nearest fixed nodes respectively to deliver
and receive information packets. We observe the phase transition of traffic
load in the hybrid network when the packet generation rate goes from below and
then above a critical value, which measures the network capacity of packets
delivery. We obtain the optimal speed of moving nodes leading to the maximum
network capacity. We further improve the network capacity by rewiring the fixed
nodes and by considering the current load of fixed nodes during packets
transmission. Our purpose is to optimize the network capacity of hybrid
networks from the perspective of network science, and provide some insights for
the construction of future communication infrastructures.

 <dc:description>  We present rootJS, an interface making it possible to seamlessly integrate
ROOT 6 into applications written for Node.js, the JavaScript runtime platform
increasingly commonly used to create high-performance Web applications. ROOT
features can be called both directly from Node.js code and by JIT-compiling C++
macros. All rootJS methods are invoked asynchronously and support callback
functions, allowing non-blocking operation of Node.js applications using them.
Last but not least, our bindings have been designed to platform-independent and
should therefore work on all systems supporting both ROOT 6 and Node.js.
  Thanks to rootJS it is now possible to create ROOT-aware Web applications
taking full advantage of the high performance and extensive capabilities of
Node.js. Examples include platforms for the quality assurance of acquired,
reconstructed or simulated data, book-keeping and e-log systems, and even Web
browser-based data visualisation and analysis.

 <dc:title>Stochastic Optimization from Distributed, Streaming Data in Rate-limited

 <dc:description>  Motivated by machine learning applications in networks of sensors,
internet-of-things (IoT) devices, and autonomous agents, we propose techniques
for distributed stochastic convex learning from high-rate data streams. The
setup involves a network of nodes---each one of which has a stream of data
arriving at a constant rate---that solve a stochastic convex optimization
problem by collaborating with each other over rate-limited communication links.
To this end, we present and analyze two algorithms---termed distributed
stochastic approximation mirror descent (D-SAMD) and {\em accelerated}
distributed stochastic approximation mirror descent (AD-SAMD)---that are based
on two stochastic variants of mirror descent. The main collaborative step in
the proposed algorithms is approximate averaging of the local, noisy
subgradients using distributed consensus. While distributed consensus is well
suited for collaborative learning, its use in our setup results in perturbed
subgradient averages due to rate-limited links, which may slow down or prevent
convergence. Our main contributions in this regard are: (i) bounds on the
convergence rates of D-SAMD and AD-SAMD in terms of the number of nodes,
network topology, and ratio of the data streaming and communication rates, and
(ii) sufficient conditions for order-optimum convergence of D-SAMD and AD-SAMD.
In particular, we show that there exist regimes under which AD-SAMD, when
compared to D-SAMD, achieves order-optimum convergence with slower
communications rates. This is in contrast to the centralized setting in which
use of accelerated mirror descent results in a modest improvement over regular
mirror descent for stochastic composite optimization. Finally, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms using numerical experiments.

 <dc:description>  Saffron is the most expensive spice and is significantly valuable in non-oil
export. Drying process of saffron is considered as a critical control point
with major effects on quality and safety parameters. A suitable drying method
covering standards and market requirements while it is costlty benefitial and
saves energy is desirable. Solar drying could be introduced as an appropriate
procedure in rural and collecting sites of saffron since major micorobial and
chemical factors of saffron can be preserved and achieved by using a renewable
energy source. So, a precise system taking advantage of management, engineering
and food technology sciences could be developed. Since there was no published
record of integrated methods of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy
Quality Function Deployment (FQFD) applied to solar energy drying systems, in
this paper, Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment as a quality management tool by
emphasizing technical and customer requirements has been implemented in order
to improve quality parameters, optimizing technological expenses and market
expansion strategy. Subsequently, Analytical Hierarchy Process based on survey
from customers and logical pair-wise comparison are employed to decrease costs
and increase the efficiency and the effectiveness of economic indicators. Using
the integrated approach of AHP and FQFD in solar drying systems in saffron
industry will result in cost benefit, quality improvement, the customer
satisfaction enhancement, and the increase in saffron exports.

 <dc:description>  In our previous work we reported on a linked-courses learning community for
underrepresented groups in computer science, finding differences in attitudes
and resource utilization between students in the community and other
programming students. Here we present the first statistically significant
differences in pre- to post-quarter student attitudes between those in the
learning community and others taking equivalent programming classes. We find
that students in the learning community are less likely to feel isolated
post-quarter than other programming students. We also present results showing
differences in resource utilization by learning-community participants.

 <dc:description>  Vehicle climate control systems aim to keep passengers thermally comfortable.
However, current systems control temperature rather than thermal comfort and
tend to be energy hungry, which is of particular concern when considering
electric vehicles. This paper poses energy-efficient vehicle comfort control as
a Markov Decision Process, which is then solved numerically using
Sarsa({\lambda}) and an empirically validated, single-zone, 1D thermal model of
the cabin. The resulting controller was tested in simulation using 200 randomly
selected scenarios and found to exceed the performance of bang-bang,
proportional, simple fuzzy logic, and commercial controllers with 23%, 43%,
40%, 56% increase, respectively. Compared to the next best performing
controller, energy consumption is reduced by 13% while the proportion of time
spent thermally comfortable is increased by 23%. These results indicate that
this is a viable approach that promises to translate into substantial comfort
and energy improvements in the car.

 <dc:title>Fundamental Limits of Coded Caching: From Uncoded Prefetching to Coded
  Prefetching</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Kai</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In order to characterize the fundamental limit of the tradeoff between the
amount of cache memory and the delivery transmission rate of multiuser caching
systems, various coding schemes have been proposed in the literature. These
schemes can largely be categorized into two classes, namely uncoded prefetching
schemes and coded prefetching schemes. While uncoded prefetching schemes in
general offer order-wise optimal performance, coded prefetching schemes often
have better performance at the low cache memory regime. The significant
differences in the coding components between the two classes may leave the
impression that they are largely unrelated. In this work, we provide a
connection between the uncoded prefetching scheme proposed by Maddah Ali and
Niesen (and its improved version by Yu et al) and the coded prefetching scheme
proposed by Tian and Chen. A critical observation is first given where a coding
component in the Tian-Chen scheme can be replaced by a binary .code, which
enables us to view the two schemes as the extremes of a more general scheme. An
explicit example is given to show that the intermediate operating points of
this general scheme can in fact provide new memory-rate tradeoff points
previously not known to be achievable in the literature. This new general
coding scheme is then presented and analyzed rigorously, which yields a new
inner bound to the memory-rate tradeoff for the caching problem.

 <dc:description>  The recent demographic trends indicate towards a rapidly increasing
population growth and a significant portion of this increased population now
prefer to live mostly in cities. In connection with this, it has become the
responsibility of the government to ensure a quality standard of living in the
cities and also make sure that these facilities trickle down to the next
generation. A program named Smart City Mission has been started for this
purpose. With an extremely diverse population, that is only second to China in
the world in terms of size, the Indian government has engaged in serious
thinking for a better city planning and providing numerous opportunities for
the citizenry. It was, therefore, planned that the Smart City Mission program
will be able to provide a highly responsive infrastructure, network security, a
good living environment and the like. Internet of things (IoT) application in
smart cities turns out to be the most challenging in this phase. The
information available in the internet has made accessible to many devices
through IoT and it also aware the citizen in many aspects. But with the
increasing number of devices and information, it is now becoming increasingly
difficult to depend on IoT to manage things in the internet space with a
similar degree of ease. As a result, cloud-based technologies have given
preferences over the existing one and IoT has been replaced by the newly
introduced Cloud of Things (CoT) paradigm. This paper intends to connect
different smart city applications for the betterment of city life with the
Cloud of Things (CoT). Our proposed smart city architecture is based on Cloud
of Things, and the focus is also given to identify the existing as well as the
forthcoming challenges for the concerned program of the government. By
identifying the difficulties it is expected that the project will be
materialized with a great success.

 <dc:description>  As part of a complete software stack for autonomous driving, NVIDIA has
created a neural-network-based system, known as PilotNet, which outputs
steering angles given images of the road ahead. PilotNet is trained using road
images paired with the steering angles generated by a human driving a
data-collection car. It derives the necessary domain knowledge by observing
human drivers. This eliminates the need for human engineers to anticipate what
is important in an image and foresee all the necessary rules for safe driving.
Road tests demonstrated that PilotNet can successfully perform lane keeping in
a wide variety of driving conditions, regardless of whether lane markings are
present or not.
  The goal of the work described here is to explain what PilotNet learns and
how it makes its decisions. To this end we developed a method for determining
which elements in the road image most influence PilotNet's steering decision.
Results show that PilotNet indeed learns to recognize relevant objects on the
road.
  In addition to learning the obvious features such as lane markings, edges of
roads, and other cars, PilotNet learns more subtle features that would be hard
to anticipate and program by engineers, for example, bushes lining the edge of
the road and atypical vehicle classes.

 <dc:description>  Our goal is to learn a semantic parser that maps natural language utterances
into executable programs when only indirect supervision is available: examples
are labeled with the correct execution result, but not the program itself.
Consequently, we must search the space of programs for those that output the
correct result, while not being misled by spurious programs: incorrect programs
that coincidentally output the correct result. We connect two common learning
paradigms, reinforcement learning (RL) and maximum marginal likelihood (MML),
and then present a new learning algorithm that combines the strengths of both.
The new algorithm guards against spurious programs by combining the systematic
search traditionally employed in MML with the randomized exploration of RL, and
by updating parameters such that probability is spread more evenly across
consistent programs. We apply our learning algorithm to a new neural semantic
parser and show significant gains over existing state-of-the-art results on a
recent context-dependent semantic parsing task.

 <dc:description>  In many smart infrastructure applications flexibility in achieving
sustainability goals can be gained by engaging end-users. However, these users
often have heterogeneous preferences that are unknown to the decision-maker
tasked with improving operational efficiency. Modeling user interaction as a
continuous game between non-cooperative players, we propose a robust parametric
utility learning framework that employs constrained feasible generalized least
squares estimation with heteroskedastic inference. To improve forecasting
performance, we extend the robust utility learning scheme by employing
bootstrapping with bagging, bumping, and gradient boosting ensemble methods.
Moreover, we estimate the noise covariance which provides approximated
correlations between players which we leverage to develop a novel correlated
utility learning framework. We apply the proposed methods both to a toy example
arising from Bertrand-Nash competition between two firms as well as to data
from a social game experiment designed to encourage energy efficient behavior
amongst smart building occupants. Using occupant voting data for shared
resources such as lighting, we simulate the game defined by the estimated
utility functions to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.

 <dc:description>  We present a new string SMT solver, Z3str3, that is faster than its
competitors Z3str2, Norn, CVC4, S3, and S3P over a majority of three
industrial-strength benchmarks, namely Kaluza, PISA, and IBM AppScan. Z3str3
supports string equations, linear arithmetic over length function, and regular
language membership predicate. The key algorithmic innovation behind the
efficiency of Z3str3 is a technique we call theory-aware branching, wherein we
modify Z3's branching heuristic to take into account the structure of theory
literals to compute branching activities. In the traditional DPLL(T)
architecture, the structure of theory literals is hidden from the DPLL(T) SAT
solver because of the Boolean abstraction constructed over the input theory
formula. By contrast, the theory-aware technique presented in this paper
exposes the structure of theory literals to the DPLL(T) SAT solver's branching
heuristic, thus enabling it to make much smarter decisions during its search
than otherwise. As a consequence, Z3str3 has better performance than its
competitors.

learning Naive Bayes classifiers on different training sets which are generated
by projecting the original training set to lower dimensional space. We propose
a mechanism to learn sequences of data using data chunks paradigm. The
experiments conducted on a number of UCI datasets and one synthetic dataset
demonstrate that the proposed approach performs significantly better than some
well-known online learning algorithms.

 <dc:title>POMDPs for Robotic Arm Search and Reach to Known Objects</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Silaghi, Marius</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose an approach based on probabilistic models, in particular POMDPs,
to plan optimized search processes of known objects by intelligent eye in hand
robotic arms. Searching and reaching for a known object (a pen, a book, or a
hammer) in one's office is an operation that humans perform frequently in their
daily activities. There is no reason why intelligent robotic arms would not
encounter this problem frequently in the various applications in which they are
expected to serve.
  The problem suffers from uncertainties coming both from the lack of
information about the position of the object, from noisy sensors, imperfect
models of the target object, of imperfect models of the environment, and from
approximations in computations. The use of probabilistic models helps us to
mitigate at least a few of these challenges, approaching optimality for this
important task.

 <dc:description>  We study the stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem in the presence of
side-observations across actions that occur as a result of an underlying
network structure. In our model, a bipartite graph captures the relationship
between actions and a common set of unknowns such that choosing an action
reveals observations for the unknowns that it is connected to. This models a
common scenario in online social networks where users respond to their friends'
activity, thus providing side information about each other's preferences. Our
contributions are as follows: 1) We derive an asymptotic lower bound (with
respect to time) as a function of the bi-partite network structure on the
regret of any uniformly good policy that achieves the maximum long-term average
reward. 2) We propose two policies - a randomized policy; and a policy based on
the well-known upper confidence bound (UCB) policies - both of which explore
each action at a rate that is a function of its network position. We show,
under mild assumptions, that these policies achieve the asymptotic lower bound
on the regret up to a multiplicative factor, independent of the network
structure. Finally, we use numerical examples on a real-world social network
and a routing example network to demonstrate the benefits obtained by our
policies over other existing policies.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of spatio-temporal person retrieval
from multiple videos using a natural language query, in which we output a tube
(i.e., a sequence of bounding boxes) which encloses the person described by the
query. For this problem, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of videos
containing people annotated with bounding boxes for each second and with five
natural language descriptions. To retrieve the tube of the person described by
a given natural language query, we design a model that combines methods for
spatio-temporal human detection and multimodal retrieval. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to compare a variety of tube and text representations
and multimodal retrieval methods, and present a strong baseline in this task as
well as demonstrate the efficacy of our tube representation and multimodal
feature embedding technique. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our
model by applying it to two other important tasks.

 <dc:title>Structured Production System (extended abstract)</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhou, Yi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this extended abstract, we propose Structured Production Systems (SPS),
which extend traditional production systems with well-formed syntactic
structures. Due to the richness of structures, structured production systems
significantly enhance the expressive power as well as the flexibility of
production systems, for instance, to handle uncertainty. We show that different
rule application strategies can be reduced into the basic one by utilizing
structures. Also, many fundamental approaches in computer science, including
automata, grammar and logic, can be captured by structured production systems.

 <dc:title>Uplink performance of multi-antenna cellular networks with co-operative

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a user-centric co-operative cellular network, where base stations
close to a mobile co-operate to detect its signal using a (joint) linear
minimum-mean-square-error receiver. The base stations, which have multiple
antennas, and mobiles are modeled as independent Poisson Point Processes to
avoid dependence on specific node locations. Combining stochastic geometry and
infinite random matrix theory, we derive a simple expression for the spectral
efficiency of this complex system as the number of antennas grows large. This
expression is verified by Monte Carlo simulations which support its utility for
even a moderate number of antennas. This result reveals the influence of
tangible system parameters such as mobile and base-station densities, number of
antennas per base station, and number of co-operating base stations on
achievable spectral efficiencies. For instance, we find that for a given base
station density and a constraint on the total number of co-operating antennas,
all co-operating antennas should be located at a single base station. On the
other hand, in our asymptotic regime, for the same number of co-operating
antennas, if the network is limited by the area density of antennas, then the
number of co-operating base stations should be increased with fewer antennas
per base station.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method for the
nonconvex nonsmooth optimization, and propose an accelerated SGD method by
combining the variance reduction technique with Nesterov's extrapolation
technique. Moreover, based on the local error bound condition, we establish the
linear convergence of our method to obtain a stationary point of the nonconvex
optimization. In particular, we prove that not only the sequence generated
linearly converges to a stationary point of the problem, but also the
corresponding sequence of objective values is linearly convergent. Finally,
some numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. To the
best of our knowledge, it is first proved that the accelerated SGD method
converges linearly to the local minimum of the nonconvex optimization.

 <dc:title>Nonlinear Unsupervised Clustering of Hyperspectral Images with
  Applications to Anomaly Detection and Active Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Murphy, James M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Maggioni, Mauro</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of unsupervised learning and segmentation of hyperspectral images
is a significant challenge in remote sensing. The high dimensionality of
hyperspectral data, presence of substantial noise, and overlap of classes all
contribute to the difficulty of automatically clustering and segmenting
hyperspectral images. In this article, we propose an unsupervised learning
technique that combines a geometric estimation of class modes with a
diffusion-inspired labeling that incorporates both spatial and spectral
information. The mode estimation incorporates the geometry of the hyperspectral
data by using diffusion distance to promote learning a unique mode from each
class. These class modes are then used to label all points by a joint
spatial-spectral nonlinear diffusion process. The proposed method, called
spatial-spectral diffusion learning (DLSS), is shown to perform competitively
against benchmark and state-of-the-art hyperspectral clustering methods on a
variety of synthetic and real datasets. The proposed methods are shown to enjoy
low computational complexity and fast empirical runtime. Two variations of the
proposed method are also discussed. The first variation combines the proposed
method of mode estimation with partial least squares regression (PLSR) to
efficiently segment chemical plumes in hyperspectral images for anomaly
detection. The second variation incorporates active learning to allow the user
to request labels for a very small number of pixels, which can dramatically
improve overall clustering results. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed methods, and their robustness to choices of
parameters.

 <dc:description>  The missing phase problem in X-ray crystallography is commonly solved using
the technique of molecular replacement, which borrows phases from a previously
solved homologous structure, and appends them to the measured Fourier
magnitudes of the diffraction patterns of the unknown structure. More recently,
molecular replacement has been proposed for solving the missing orthogonal
matrices problem arising in Kam's autocorrelation analysis for single particle
reconstruction using X-ray free electron lasers and cryo-EM. In classical
molecular replacement, it is common to estimate the magnitudes of the unknown
structure as twice the measured magnitudes minus the magnitudes of the
homologous structure, a procedure known as `twicing'. Mathematically, this is
equivalent to finding an unbiased estimator for a complex-valued scalar. We
generalize this scheme for the case of estimating real or complex valued
matrices arising in single particle autocorrelation analysis. We name this
approach &quot;Anisotropic Twicing&quot; because unlike the scalar case, the unbiased
estimator is not obtained by a simple magnitude isotropic correction. We
compare the performance of the least squares, twicing and anisotropic twicing
estimators on synthetic and experimental datasets. We demonstrate 3D homology
modeling in cryo-EM directly from experimental data without iterative
refinement or class averaging, for the first time.

 <dc:description>  Hypothesis testing in the linear regression model is a fundamental
statistical problem. We consider linear regression in the high-dimensional
regime where the number of parameters exceeds the number of samples ($p&gt; n$)
and assume that the high-dimensional parameters vector is $s_0$ sparse. We
develop a general and flexible $\ell_\infty$ projection statistic for
hypothesis testing in this model. Our framework encompasses testing whether the
parameter lies in a convex cone, testing the signal strength, testing arbitrary
functionals of the parameter, and testing adaptive hypothesis. We show that the
proposed procedure controls the type I error under the standard assumption of
$s_0 (\log p)/\sqrt{n}\to 0$, and also analyze the power of the procedure. Our
numerical experiments confirms our theoretical findings and demonstrate that we
control false positive rate (type I error) near the nominal level, and have
high power.

 <dc:description>  Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) recently emerged as one of the most
competitive approaches for learning in sequential decision making problems with
fully observable environments, e.g., computer Go. However, very little work has
been done in deep RL to handle partially observable environments. We propose a
new architecture called Action-specific Deep Recurrent Q-Network (ADRQN) to
enhance learning performance in partially observable domains. Actions are
encoded by a fully connected layer and coupled with a convolutional observation
to form an action-observation pair. The time series of action-observation pairs
are then integrated by an LSTM layer that learns latent states based on which a
fully connected layer computes Q-values as in conventional Deep Q-Networks
(DQNs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new architecture in several
partially observable domains, including flickering Atari games.

 <dc:description>  We consider the family of $\Phi$-Subset problems, where the input consists of
an instance $I$ of size $N$ over a universe $U_I$ of size $n$ and the task is
to check whether the universe contains a subset with property $\Phi$ (e.g.,
$\Phi$ could be the property of being a feedback vertex set for the input graph
of size at most $k$). Our main tool is a simple randomized algorithm which
solves $\Phi$-Subset in time $(1+b-\frac{1}{c})^n N^{O(1)}$, provided that
there is an algorithm for the $\Phi$-Extension problem with running time
$b^{n-|X|} c^k N^{O(1)}$. Here, the input for $\Phi$-Extension is an instance
$I$ of size $N$ over a universe $U_I$ of size $n$, a subset $X\subseteq U_I$,
and an integer $k$, and the task is to check whether there is a set $Y$ with
$X\subseteq Y \subseteq U_I$ and $|Y\setminus X|\le k$ with property $\Phi$. We
derandomize this algorithm at the cost of increasing the running time by a
subexponential factor in $n$, and we adapt it to the enumeration setting where
we need to enumerate all subsets of the universe with property $\Phi$. This
generalizes the results of Fomin et al. [STOC 2016] who proved the case where
$b=1$. As case studies, we use these results to design faster deterministic
algorithms for: - checking whether a graph has a feedback vertex set of size at
most $k$ - enumerating all minimal feedback vertex sets - enumerating all
minimal vertex covers of size at most $k$, and - enumerating all minimal
3-hitting sets. We obtain these results by deriving new $b^{n-|X|} c^k
N^{O(1)}$-time algorithms for the corresponding $\Phi$-Extension problems (or
enumeration variant). In some cases, this is done by adapting the analysis of
an existing algorithm, or in other cases by designing a new algorithm. Our
analyses are based on Measure and Conquer, but the value to minimize,
$1+b-\frac{1}{c}$, is unconventional and requires non-convex optimization.

 <dc:description>  We present in this paper our approach for modeling inter-topic preferences of
Twitter users: for example, those who agree with the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(TPP) also agree with free trade. This kind of knowledge is useful not only for
stance detection across multiple topics but also for various real-world
applications including public opinion surveys, electoral predictions, electoral
campaigns, and online debates. In order to extract users' preferences on
Twitter, we design linguistic patterns in which people agree and disagree about
specific topics (e.g., &quot;A is completely wrong&quot;). By applying these linguistic
patterns to a collection of tweets, we extract statements agreeing and
disagreeing with various topics. Inspired by previous work on item
recommendation, we formalize the task of modeling inter-topic preferences as
matrix factorization: representing users' preferences as a user-topic matrix
and mapping both users and topics onto a latent feature space that abstracts
the preferences. Our experimental results demonstrate both that our proposed
approach is useful in predicting missing preferences of users and that the
latent vector representations of topics successfully encode inter-topic
preferences.

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The $\ell_1$-regularized sparse model has been popular in machine learning
society. The orthant-wise quasi-Newton (OWL-QN) method is a representative fast
algorithm for training the model. However, the proof of the convergence has
been pointed out to be incorrect by multiple sources, and up until now, its
convergence has not been proved at all. In this paper, we propose a stochastic
OWL-QN method for solving $\ell_1$-regularized problems, both with convex and
non-convex loss functions. We address technical difficulties that have existed
many years. We propose three alignment steps which are generalized from the the
original OWL-QN algorithm, to encourage the parameter update be orthant-wise.
We adopt several practical features from recent stochastic variants of L-BFGS
and the variance reduction method for subsampled gradients. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first orthant-wise algorithms with comparable
theoretical convergence rate with stochastic first order algorithms. We prove a
linear convergence rate for our algorithm under strong convexity, and
experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-art performance
on $\ell_1$ regularized logistic regression and convolutional neural networks.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications have been considered as a key
technology for future 5G wireless networks because of the orders-of-magnitude
wider bandwidth than current cellular bands. In this paper, we consider the
problem of codebook-based joint analog-digital hybrid precoder and combiner
design for spatial multiplexing transmission in a mmWave multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system. We propose to jointly select analog precoder and
combiner pair for each data stream successively aiming at maximizing the
channel gain while suppressing the interference between different data streams.
After all analog precoder/combiner pairs have been determined, we can obtain
the effective baseband channel. Then, the digital precoder and combiner are
computed based on the obtained effective baseband channel to further mitigate
the interference and maximize the sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate that
our proposed algorithm exhibits prominent advantages in combating interference
between different data streams and offer satisfactory performance improvement
compared to the existing codebook-based hybrid beamforming schemes.

 <dc:description>  Analog/digital hybrid precoder and combiner have been widely used in
millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems due to
its energy-efficient and economic superiorities. Infinite resolution of phase
shifters (PSs) for the analog beamformer can achieve very close performance
compared to the full-digital scheme but will result in high complexity and
intensive power consumption. Thus, more cost effective and energy efficient low
resolution PSs are typically used in practical mmWave MIMO systems. In this
paper, we consider the joint hybrid precoder and combiner design with one-bit
quantized PSs in mmWave MIMO systems. We propose to firstly design the analog
precoder and combiner pair for each data stream successively, aiming at
conditionally maximizing the spectral efficiency. We present a novel binary
analog precoder and combiner optimization algorithm under a Rank-1
approximation of the interference-included equivalent channel with lower than
quadratic complexity. Then the digital precoder and combiner are computed based
on the obtained baseband effective channel to further enhance the spectral
efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
outperforms the existing one-bit PSs based hybrid beamforming scheme.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a practical wireless transmission scheme is proposed to
transmit confidential messages to the desired user securely and precisely by
the joint use of multiple techniques including artificial noise (AN)
projection, phase alignment (PA)/beamforming, and random subcarrier selection
(RSCS) based on OFDM, and directional modulation (DM), namely RSCS-OFDM-DM.
This RSCS-OFDM-DM scheme provides an extremely low-complexity structures for
the transmitter and desired receiver and makes the secure and precise wireless
transmission realizable in practice. For illegal eavesdroppers, the receive
power of confidential messages is so weak that their receivers cannot intercept
these confidential messages successfully once it is corrupted by AN. In such a
scheme, the design of phase alignment/beamforming vector and AN projection
matrix depend intimately on the desired direction angle and distance. It is
particularly noted that the use of RSCS leads to a significant outcome that the
receive power of confidential messages mainly concentrates on the small
neighboring region around the desired receiver and only small fraction of its
power leaks out to the remaining large broad regions. This concept is called
secure precise transmission. The probability density function of real-time
receive signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) is derived. Also, the
average SINR and its tight upper bound are attained. The approximate
closed-form expression for average secrecy rate is derived by analyzing the
first-null positions of SINR and clarifying the wiretap region.

 <dc:description>  A strategy for constructing dynamic programs is introduced that utilises
periodic computation of auxiliary data from scratch and the ability to maintain
a query for a limited number of change steps. It is established that if some
program can maintain a query for log n change steps after an AC$^1$-computable
initialisation, it can be maintained by a first-order dynamic program as well,
i.e., in DynFO. As an application, it is shown that decision and optimisation
problems defined by monadic second-order (MSO) and guarded second-order logic
(GSO) formulas are in DynFO, if only change sequences that produce graphs of
bounded treewidth are allowed. To establish this result, Feferman-Vaught-type
composition theorems for MSO and GSO are established that might be useful in
their own right.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the problem of hybrid precoder and combiner design
for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) systems operating in millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. We
propose a novel iterative scheme to design the codebook-based analog precoder
and combiner in forward and reverse channels. During each iteration, we apply
compressive sensing (CS) technology to efficiently estimate the equivalent
MIMO-OFDM mmWave channel. Then, the analog precoder or combiner is obtained
based on the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm to alleviate the
interference between different data streams as well as maximize the spectral
efficiency. The digital precoder and combiner are finally obtained based on the
effective baseband channel to further enhance the spectral efficiency.
Simulation results demonstrate the proposed iterative hybrid precoder and
combiner algorithm has significant performance advantages.

 <dc:description>  We say that an algorithm is stable if small changes in the input result in
small changes in the output. Algorithm stability plays an important role when
analyzing and visualizing time-varying data. However, so far, there are only
few theoretical results on the stability of algorithms, possibly due to a lack
of theoretical analysis tools. In this paper we present a framework for
analyzing the stability of algorithms. We focus in particular on the tradeoff
between the stability of an algorithm and the quality of the solution it
computes. Our framework allows for three types of stability analysis with
increasing degrees of complexity: event stability, topological stability, and
Lipschitz stability. We demonstrate the use of our stability framework by
applying it to kinetic Euclidean minimum spanning trees.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a key role in many applications. Current
studies focus on crafting adversarial samples against DNN-based image
classifiers by introducing some imperceptible perturbations to the input.
However, DNNs for natural language processing have not got the attention they
deserve. In fact, the existing perturbation algorithms for images cannot be
directly applied to text. This paper presents a simple but effective method to
attack DNN-based text classifiers. Three perturbation strategies, namely
insertion, modification, and removal, are designed to generate an adversarial
sample for a given text. By computing the cost gradients, what should be
inserted, modified or removed, where to insert and how to modify are determined
effectively. The experimental results show that the adversarial samples
generated by our method can successfully fool a state-of-the-art model to
misclassify them as any desirable classes without compromising their utilities.
At the same time, the introduced perturbations are difficult to be perceived.
Our study demonstrates that DNN-based text classifiers are also prone to the
adversarial sample attack.

 <dc:description>  Physical layer security has been considered as an important security approach
in wireless communications to protect legitimate transmission from passive
eavesdroppers. This paper investigates the physical layer security of a
wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) communication system in the presence of a multiple-antenna
eavesdropper. We first propose a transmit-filter-assisted secure MIMO-OFDM
system which can destroy the orthogonality of eavesdropper's signals. Our
proposed transmit filter can disturb the reception of eavesdropper while
maintaining the quality of legitimate transmission. Then, we propose another
artificial noise (AN)-assisted secure MIMO-OFDM system to further improve the
security of the legitimate transmission. The time-domain AN signal is designed
to disturb the reception of eavesdropper while the legitimate transmission will
not be affected. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the security
performance of the proposed transmit filter design and AN-assisted scheme in
the MIMO-OFDM system.

 <dc:description>  Language models are typically applied at the sentence level, without access
to the broader document context. We present a neural language model that
incorporates document context in the form of a topic model-like architecture,
thus providing a succinct representation of the broader document context
outside of the current sentence. Experiments over a range of datasets
demonstrate that our model outperforms a pure sentence-based model in terms of
language model perplexity, and leads to topics that are potentially more
coherent than those produced by a standard LDA topic model. Our model also has
the ability to generate related sentences for a topic, providing another way to
interpret topics.

 <dc:description>  For noisy compressive sensing systems, the asymptotic distortion with respect
to an arbitrary distortion function is determined when a general class of
least-square based reconstruction schemes is employed. The sampling matrix is
considered to belong to a large ensemble of random matrices including i.i.d.
and projector matrices, and the source vector is assumed to be i.i.d. with a
desired distribution. We take a statistical mechanical approach by representing
the asymptotic distortion as a macroscopic parameter of a spin glass and
employing the replica method for the large-system analysis. In contrast to
earlier studies, we evaluate the general replica ansatz which includes the RS
ansatz as well as RSB. The generality of the solution enables us to study the
impact of symmetry breaking. Our numerical investigations depict that for the
reconstruction scheme with the &quot;zero-norm&quot; penalty function, the RS fails to
predict the asymptotic distortion for relatively large compression rates;
however, the one-step RSB ansatz gives a valid prediction of the performance
within a larger regime of compression rates.

 <dc:description>  In phase retrieval problems, a signal of interest (SOI) is reconstructed
based on the magnitude of a linear transformation of the SOI observed with
additive noise. The linear transform is typically referred to as a measurement
matrix. Many works on phase retrieval assume that the measurement matrix is a
random Gaussian matrix, which, in the noiseless scenario with sufficiently many
measurements, guarantees invertability of the transformation between the SOI
and the observations, up to an inherent phase ambiguity. However, in many
practical applications, the measurement matrix corresponds to an underlying
physical setup, and is therefore deterministic, possibly with structural
constraints. In this work we study the design of deterministic measurement
matrices, based on maximizing the mutual information between the SOI and the
observations. We characterize necessary conditions for the optimality of a
measurement matrix, and analytically obtain the optimal matrix in the low
signal-to-noise ratio regime. Practical methods for designing general
measurement matrices and masked Fourier measurements are proposed. Simulation
tests demonstrate the performance gain achieved by the proposed techniques
compared to random Gaussian measurements for various phase recovery algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Complex networks have emerged as a simple yet powerful framework to represent
and analyze a wide range of complex systems. The problem of ranking the nodes
and the edges in complex networks is critical for a broad range of real-world
problems because it affects how we access online information and products, how
success and talent are evaluated in human activities, and how scarce resources
are allocated by companies and policymakers, among others. This calls for a
deep understanding of how existing ranking algorithms perform, and which are
their possible biases that may impair their effectiveness. Well-established
ranking algorithms (such as the popular Google's PageRank) are static in nature
and, as a consequence, they exhibit important shortcomings when applied to real
networks that rapidly evolve in time. The recent advances in the understanding
and modeling of evolving networks have enabled the development of a wide and
diverse range of ranking algorithms that take the temporal dimension into
account. The aim of this review is to survey the existing ranking algorithms,
both static and time-aware, and their applications to evolving networks. We
emphasize both the impact of network evolution on well-established static
algorithms and the benefits from including the temporal dimension for tasks
such as prediction of real network traffic, prediction of future links, and
identification of highly-significant nodes.

 <dc:description>  Speech is the most used communication method between humans and it involves
the perception of auditory and visual channels. Automatic speech recognition
focuses on interpreting the audio signals, although the video can provide
information that is complementary to the audio. Exploiting the visual
information, however, has proven challenging. On one hand, researchers have
reported that the mapping between phonemes and visemes (visual units) is
one-to-many because there are phonemes which are visually similar and
indistinguishable between them. On the other hand, it is known that some people
are very good lip-readers (e.g: deaf people). We study the limit of visual only
speech recognition in controlled conditions. With this goal, we designed a new
database in which the speakers are aware of being read and aim to facilitate
lip-reading. In the literature, there are discrepancies on whether
hearing-impaired people are better lip-readers than normal-hearing people.
Then, we analyze if there are differences between the lip-reading abilities of
9 hearing-impaired and 15 normal-hearing people. Finally, human abilities are
compared with the performance of a visual automatic speech recognition system.
In our tests, hearing-impaired participants outperformed the normal-hearing
participants but without reaching statistical significance. Human observers
were able to decode 44% of the spoken message. In contrast, the visual only
automatic system achieved 20% of word recognition rate. However, if we repeat
the comparison in terms of phonemes both obtained very similar recognition
rates, just above 50%. This suggests that the gap between human lip-reading and
automatic speech-reading might be more related to the use of context than to
the ability to interpret mouth appearance.

 <dc:description>  Some lung diseases are related to bronchial airway structures and morphology.
Although airway segmentation from chest CT volumes is an important task in the
computer-aided diagnosis and surgery assistance systems for the chest, complete
3-D airway structure segmentation is a quite challenging task due to its
complex tree-like structure. In this paper, we propose a new airway
segmentation method from 3D chest CT volumes based on volume of interests (VOI)
using gradient vector flow (GVF). This method segments the bronchial regions by
applying the cavity enhancement filter (CEF) to trace the bronchial tree
structure from the trachea. It uses the CEF in the VOI to segment each branch.
And a tube-likeness function based on GVF and the GVF magnitude map in each VOI
are utilized to assist predicting the positions and directions of child
branches. By calculating the tube-likeness function based on GVF and the GVF
magnitude map, the airway-like candidate structures are identified and their
centrelines are extracted. Based on the extracted centrelines, we can detect
the branch points of the bifurcations and directions of the airway branches in
the next level. At the same time, a leakage detection is performed to avoid the
leakage by analysing the pixel information and the shape information of airway
candidate regions extracted in the VOI. Finally, we unify all of the extracted
bronchial regions to form an integrated airway tree. Preliminary experiments
using four cases of chest CT volumes demonstrated that the proposed method can
extract more bronchial branches in comparison with other methods.

 <dc:description>  To address the economical dispatch problem without communications in islanded
AC microgrids consisting of cascaded inverters, this paper proposes an optimal
decentralized economical-sharing scheme. In proposed scheme, optimal sharing
function of the current is applied to generate the reference voltages. And the
frequency is used to drive all distributed generators (DGs) synchronize
operation in microgrids. When the microgrid is in steady state, DGs share a
single common frequency and current in terms of the proposed scheme. Thus the
potential advantages of simplicity and decentralized manner are retained. The
AC microgrid model has been developed through simulations and experiments to
verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed scheme.

 <dc:title>Automatic Viseme Vocabulary Construction to Enhance Continuous
  Lip-reading</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fernandez-Lopez, Adriana</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Speech is the most common communication method between humans and involves
the perception of both auditory and visual channels. Automatic speech
recognition focuses on interpreting the audio signals, but it has been
demonstrated that video can provide information that is complementary to the
audio. Thus, the study of automatic lip-reading is important and is still an
open problem. One of the key challenges is the definition of the visual
elementary units (the visemes) and their vocabulary. Many researchers have
analyzed the importance of the phoneme to viseme mapping and have proposed
viseme vocabularies with lengths between 11 and 15 visemes. These viseme
vocabularies have usually been manually defined by their linguistic properties
and in some cases using decision trees or clustering techniques. In this work,
we focus on the automatic construction of an optimal viseme vocabulary based on
the association of phonemes with similar appearance. To this end, we construct
an automatic system that uses local appearance descriptors to extract the main
characteristics of the mouth region and HMMs to model the statistic relations
of both viseme and phoneme sequences. To compare the performance of the system
different descriptors (PCA, DCT and SIFT) are analyzed. We test our system in a
Spanish corpus of continuous speech. Our results indicate that we are able to
recognize approximately 58% of the visemes, 47% of the phonemes and 23% of the
words in a continuous speech scenario and that the optimal viseme vocabulary
for Spanish is composed by 20 visemes.

 <dc:description>  While the optimization problem behind deep neural networks is highly
non-convex, it is frequently observed in practice that training deep networks
seems possible without getting stuck in suboptimal points. It has been argued
that this is the case as all local minima are close to being globally optimal.
We show that this is (almost) true, in fact almost all local minima are
globally optimal, for a fully connected network with squared loss and analytic
activation function given that the number of hidden units of one layer of the
network is larger than the number of training points and the network structure
from this layer on is pyramidal.

 <dc:description>  We focus on the analysis of planar shapes and solid objects having thin
features and propose a new mathematical model to characterize them. Based on
our model, that we call an epsilon-shape, we show how thin parts can be
effectively and efficiently detected by an algorithm, and propose a novel
approach to thicken these features while leaving all the other parts of the
shape unchanged. When compared with state-of-the-art solutions, our proposal
proves to be particularly flexible, efficient and stable, and does not require
any unintuitive parameter to fine-tune the process. Furthermore, our method is
able to detect thin features both in the object and in its complement, thus
providing a useful tool to detect thin cavities and narrow channels. We discuss
the importance of this kind of analysis in the design of robust structures and
in the creation of geometry to be fabricated with modern additive manufacturing
technology.

 <dc:title>On Maximizing Sensor Network Lifetime by Energy Balancing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Many physical systems, such as water/electricity distribution networks, are
monitored by battery-powered Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Since battery
replacement of sensor nodes is generally difficult, long-term monitoring can be
only achieved if the operation of the WSN nodes contributes to a long WSN
lifetime. Two prominent techniques to long WSN lifetime are i) optimal sensor
activation and ii) efficient data gathering and forwarding based on compressive
sensing. These techniques are feasible only if the activated sensor nodes
establish a connected communication network (connectivity constraint), and
satisfy a compressive sensing decoding constraint (cardinality constraint).
These two constraints make the problem of maximizing network lifetime via
sensor node activation and compressive sensing NP-hard. To overcome this
difficulty, an alternative approach that iteratively solves energy balancing
problems is proposed. However, understanding whether maximizing network
lifetime and energy balancing problems are aligned objectives is a fundamental
open issue. The analysis reveals that the two optimization problems give
different solutions, but the difference between the lifetime achieved by the
energy balancing approach and the maximum lifetime is small when the initial
energy at sensor nodes is significantly larger than the energy consumed for a
single transmission. The lifetime achieved by the energy balancing is
asymptotically optimal, and that the achievable network lifetime is at least
$50$\% of the optimum. Analysis and numerical simulations quantify the
efficiency of the proposed energy balancing approach.

hardware and software. The size of the automaton model learned is a bottleneck
for scalability and hence optimizations that enable learning of compact
representations are important. In this paper we develop a class of
optimizations and an accompanying correctness proof for learning algorithms,
building upon a general framework for automata learning based on category
theory. The new algorithm is parametric on a monad, which provides a rich
algebraic structure to capture non-determinism and other side-effects. Our
approach allows us to capture known algorithms, develop new ones, and add
optimizations. We provide a prototype implementation and experimental results.

 <dc:description>  Skip-Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding model, well known by its
implementation in &quot;word2vec&quot; software, is usually optimized by stochastic
gradient descent. However, the optimization of SGNS objective can be viewed as
a problem of searching for a good matrix with the low-rank constraint. The most
standard way to solve this type of problems is to apply Riemannian optimization
framework to optimize the SGNS objective over the manifold of required low-rank
matrices. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that optimizes SGNS objective
using Riemannian optimization and demonstrates its superiority over popular
competitors, such as the original method to train SGNS and SVD over SPPMI
matrix.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses deep face recognition (FR) problem under open-set
protocol, where ideal face features are expected to have smaller maximal
intra-class distance than minimal inter-class distance under a suitably chosen
metric space. However, few existing algorithms can effectively achieve this
criterion. To this end, we propose the angular softmax (A-Softmax) loss that
enables convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn angularly discriminative
features. Geometrically, A-Softmax loss can be viewed as imposing
discriminative constraints on a hypersphere manifold, which intrinsically
matches the prior that faces also lie on a manifold. Moreover, the size of
angular margin can be quantitatively adjusted by a parameter $m$. We further
derive specific $m$ to approximate the ideal feature criterion. Extensive
analysis and experiments on Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW), Youtube Faces (YTF)
and MegaFace Challenge show the superiority of A-Softmax loss in FR tasks. The
code has also been made publicly available.

 <dc:description>  Decentralized systems are a subset of distributed systems where multiple
authorities control different components and no authority is fully trusted by
all. This implies that any component in a decentralized system is potentially
adversarial. We revise fifteen years of research on decentralization and
privacy, and provide an overview of key systems, as well as key insights for
designers of future systems. We show that decentralized designs can enhance
privacy, integrity, and availability but also require careful trade-offs in
terms of system complexity, properties provided, and degree of
decentralization. These trade-offs need to be understood and navigated by
designers. We argue that a combination of insights from cryptography,
distributed systems, and mechanism design, aligned with the development of
adequate incentives, are necessary to build scalable and successful
privacy-preserving decentralized systems.

 <dc:description>  Within machine learning, the supervised learning field aims at modeling the
input-output relationship of a system, from past observations of its behavior.
Decision trees characterize the input-output relationship through a series of
nested $if-then-else$ questions, the testing nodes, leading to a set of
predictions, the leaf nodes. Several of such trees are often combined together
for state-of-the-art performance: random forest ensembles average the
predictions of randomized decision trees trained independently in parallel,
while tree boosting ensembles train decision trees sequentially to refine the
predictions made by the previous ones.
  The emergence of new applications requires scalable supervised learning
algorithms in terms of computational power and memory space with respect to the
number of inputs, outputs, and observations without sacrificing accuracy. In
this thesis, we identify three main areas where decision tree methods could be
improved for which we provide and evaluate original algorithmic solutions: (i)
learning over high dimensional output spaces, (ii) learning with large sample
datasets and stringent memory constraints at prediction time and (iii) learning
over high dimensional sparse input spaces.

 <dc:title>Understanding the Feedforward Artificial Neural Network Model From the
  Perspective of Network Flow</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In recent years, deep learning based on artificial neural network (ANN) has
achieved great success in pattern recognition. However, there is no clear
understanding of such neural computational models. In this paper, we try to
unravel &quot;black-box&quot; structure of Ann model from network flow. Specifically, we
consider the feed forward Ann as a network flow model, which consists of many
directional class-pathways. Each class-pathway encodes one class. The
class-pathway of a class is obtained by connecting the activated neural nodes
in each layer from input to output, where activation value of neural node
(node-value) is defined by the weights of each layer in a trained
ANN-classifier. From the perspective of the class-pathway, training an
ANN-classifier can be regarded as the formulation process of class-pathways of
different classes. By analyzing the the distances of each two class-pathways in
a trained ANN-classifiers, we try to answer the questions, why the classifier
performs so? At last, from the neural encodes view, we define the importance of
each neural node through the class-pathways, which is helpful to optimize the
structure of a classifier. Experiments for two types of ANN model including
multi-layer MLP and CNN verify that the network flow based on class-pathway is
a reasonable explanation for ANN models.

 <dc:description>  Microservices is an emerging development paradigm where software is obtained
by composing autonomous entities, called (micro)services. However, microservice
systems are currently developed using general-purpose programming languages
that do not provide dedicated abstractions for service composition. Instead,
current practice is focused on the deployment aspects of microservices, in
particular by using containerization. In this chapter, we make the case for a
language-based approach to the engineering of microservice architectures, which
we believe is complementary to current practice. We discuss the approach in
general, and then we instantiate it in terms of the Jolie programming language.

 <dc:description>  Classifiers trained on given databases perform poorly when tested on data
acquired in different settings. This is explained in domain adaptation through
a shift among distributions of the source and target domains. Attempts to align
them have traditionally resulted in works reducing the domain shift by
introducing appropriate loss terms, measuring the discrepancies between source
and target distributions, in the objective function. Here we take a different
route, proposing to align the learned representations by embedding in any given
network specific Domain Alignment Layers, designed to match the source and
target feature distributions to a reference one. Opposite to previous works
which define a priori in which layers adaptation should be performed, our
method is able to automatically learn the degree of feature alignment required
at different levels of the deep network. Thorough experiments on different
public benchmarks, in the unsupervised setting, confirm the power of our
approach.

 <dc:description>  Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a mental disorder difficult to diagnose.
Linguistic features, mainly from parsers, have been used to detect MCI, but
this is not suitable for large-scale assessments. MCI disfluencies produce
non-grammatical speech that requires manual or high precision automatic
correction of transcripts. In this paper, we modeled transcripts into complex
networks and enriched them with word embedding (CNE) to better represent short
texts produced in neuropsychological assessments. The network measurements were
applied with well-known classifiers to automatically identify MCI in
transcripts, in a binary classification task. A comparison was made with the
performance of traditional approaches using Bag of Words (BoW) and linguistic
features for three datasets: DementiaBank in English, and Cinderella and
Arizona-Battery in Portuguese. Overall, CNE provided higher accuracy than using
only complex networks, while Support Vector Machine was superior to other
classifiers. CNE provided the highest accuracies for DementiaBank and
Cinderella, but BoW was more efficient for the Arizona-Battery dataset probably
owing to its short narratives. The approach using linguistic features yielded
higher accuracy if the transcriptions of the Cinderella dataset were manually
revised. Taken together, the results indicate that complex networks enriched
with embedding is promising for detecting MCI in large-scale assessments

 <dc:title>A Faster Patch Ordering Method for Image Denoising</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Munir, Badre</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.4.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Among the patch-based image denoising processing methods, smooth ordering of
local patches (patch ordering) has been shown to give state-of-art results. For
image denoising the patch ordering method forms two large TSPs (Traveling
Salesman Problem) comprised of nodes in N-dimensional space. Ten approximate
solutions of the two large TSPs are then used in a filtering process to form
the reconstructed image. Use of large TSPs makes patch ordering a
computationally intensive method. A modified patch ordering method for image
denoising is proposed. In the proposed method, several smaller-sized TSPs are
formed and the filtering process varied to work with solutions of these smaller
TSPs. In terms of PSNR, denoising results of the proposed method differed by
0.032 dB to 0.016 dB on average. In original method, solving TSPs was observed
to consume 85% of execution time. In proposed method, the time for solving TSPs
can be reduced to half of the time required in original method. The proposed
method can denoise images in 40% less time.

relations and demonstrate that modeling argument pairs as a joint sequence can
outperform word order-agnostic approaches. Our model benefits from a partial
sampling scheme and is conceptually simple, yet achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Chinese Discourse Treebank. We also visualize its attention
activity to illustrate the model's ability to selectively focus on the relevant
parts of an input sequence.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications have been considered as a key
technology for future 5G wireless networks. In order to overcome the severe
propagation loss of mmWave channel, mmWave multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems with analog/digital hybrid precoding and combining transceiver
architecture have been widely considered. However, physical layer security
(PLS) in mmWave MIMO systems and the secure hybrid beamformer design have not
been well investigated. In this paper, we consider the problem of hybrid
precoder and combiner design for secure transmission in mmWave MIMO systems in
order to protect the legitimate transmission from eavesdropping. When
eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI) is known, we first propose a
joint analog precoder and combiner design algorithm which can prevent the
information leakage to the eavesdropper. Then, the digital precoder and
combiner are computed based on the obtained effective baseband channel to
further maximize the secrecy rate. Next, if prior knowledge of the
eavesdropper's CSI is unavailable, we develop an artificial noise (AN)-based
hybrid beamforming approach, which can jam eavesdropper's reception while
maintaining the quality-of-service (QoS) of intended receiver at the
pre-specified level. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed
algorithms offer significant secrecy performance improvement compared with
other hybrid beamforming algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The aim of process discovery, originating from the area of process mining, is
to discover a process model based on business process execution data. A
majority of process discovery techniques relies on an event log as an input. An
event log is a static source of historical data capturing the execution of a
business process. In this paper we focus on process discovery relying on online
streams of business process execution events. Learning process models from
event streams poses both challenges and opportunities, i.e. we need to handle
unlimited amounts of data using finite memory and, preferably, constant time.
We propose a generic architecture that allows for adopting several classes of
existing process discovery techniques in context of event streams. Moreover, we
provide several instantiations of the architecture, accompanied by
implementations in the process mining tool-kit ProM (http://promtools.org).
Using these instantiations, we evaluate several dimensions of stream-based
process discovery. The evaluation shows that the proposed architecture allows
us to lift process discovery to the streaming domain.

 <dc:title>A Popperian Falsification of AI - Lighthill's Argument Defended</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>I.1.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The area of computation called artificial intelligence (AI) is falsified by
describing a previous 1972 falsification of AI by British applied mathematician
James Lighthill. It is explained how Lighthill's arguments continue to apply to
current AI. It is argued that AI should use the Popperian scientific method in
which it is the duty of every scientist to attempt to falsify theories and if
theories are falsified to replace or modify them. The paper describes the
Popperian method in detail and discusses Paul Nurse's application of the method
to cell biology that also involves questions of mechanism and behavior.
Arguments used by Lighthill in his original 1972 report that falsifed AI are
discussed. The Lighthill arguments are then shown to apply to current AI. The
argument uses recent scholarship to explain Lighthill's assumptions and to show
how the arguments based on those assumptions continue to falsify modern AI. An
iimportant focus of the argument involves Hilbert's philosophical programme
that defined knowledge and truth as provable formal sentences. Current AI takes
the Hilbert programme as dogma beyond criticism while Lighthill as a mid 20th
century applied mathematician had abandoned it. The paper uses recent
scholarship to explain John von Neumann's criticism of AI that I claim was
assumed by Lighthill. The paper discusses computer chess programs to show
Lighthill's combinatorial explosion still applies to AI but not humans. An
argument showing that Turing Machines (TM) are not the correct description of
computation is given. The paper concludes by advocating studying computation as
Peter Naur's Dataology.

 <dc:description>  We propose a development of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) permitting
to use the methodology also in cases of decision problems with a very large
number of alternatives evaluated with respect to several criteria. While the
application of the original AHP method involves many pairwise comparisons
between alternatives and criteria, our proposal is composed of three steps: (i)
direct evaluation of the alternatives at hand on the considered criteria, (ii)
selection of some reference evaluations; (iii) application of the original AHP
method to reference evaluations; (iv) revision of the direct evaluation on the
basis of the prioritization supplied by AHP on reference evaluations. The new
proposal has been tested and validated in an experiment conducted on a sample
of university students. The new methodology has been therefore applied to a
real world problem involving the evaluation of 21 Social Housing initiatives
sited in the Piedmont region (Italy). To take into account interaction between
criteria, the Choquet integral preference model has been considered within a
Non Additive Robust Ordinal Regression approach.

 <dc:description>  Being a task of establishing spatial correspondences, medical image
registration is often formalized as finding the optimal transformation that
best aligns two images. Since the transformation is such an essential component
of registration, most existing researches conventionally quantify the
registration uncertainty, which is the confidence in the estimated spatial
correspondences, by the transformation uncertainty. In this paper, we give
concrete examples and reveal that using the transformation uncertainty to
quantify the registration uncertainty is inappropriate and sometimes
misleading. Based on this finding, we also raise attention to an important yet
subtle aspect of probabilistic image registration, that is whether it is
reasonable to determine the correspondence of a registered voxel solely by the
mode of its transformation distribution.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of finding the cycle of minimum cost-to-time ratio in a
directed graph with $ n $ nodes and $ m $ edges. This problem has a long
history in combinatorial optimization and has recently seen interesting
applications in the context of quantitative verification. We focus on strongly
polynomial algorithms to cover the use-case where the weights are relatively
large compared to the size of the graph. Our main result is an algorithm with
running time $ \tilde O (m^{3/4} n^{3/2}) $, which gives the first improvement
over Megiddo's $ \tilde O (n^3) $ algorithm [JACM'83] for sparse graphs. We
further demonstrate how to obtain both an algorithm with running time $ n^3 /
2^{\Omega{(\sqrt{\log n})}} $ on general graphs and an algorithm with running
time $ \tilde O (n) $ on constant treewidth graphs. To obtain our main result,
we develop a parallel algorithm for negative cycle detection and single-source
shortest paths that might be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  With onboard operating systems becoming increasingly common in vehicles, the
real-time broadband infotainment and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS)
service applications in fast-motion vehicles become ever demanding, which are
highly expected to significantly improve the efficiency and safety of our daily
on-road lives. The emerging ITS and vehicular applications, e.g., trip
planning, however, require substantial efforts on the real-time pervasive
information collection and big data processing so as to provide quick decision
making and feedbacks to the fast moving vehicles, which thus impose the
significant challenges on the development of an efficient vehicular
communication platform. In this article, we present TrasoNET, an integrated
network framework to provide realtime intelligent transportation services to
connected vehicles by exploring the data analytics and networking techniques.
TrasoNET is built upon two key components. The first one guides vehicles to the
appropriate access networks by exploring the information of realtime traffic
status, specific user preferences, service applications and network conditions.
The second component mainly involves a distributed automatic access engine,
which enables individual vehicles to make distributed access decisions based on
access recommender, local observation and historic information. We showcase the
application of TrasoNET in a case study on real-time traffic sensing based on
real traces of taxis.

 <dc:description>  Wireless engineers and business planners commonly raise the question on
where, when, and how millimeter-wave (mmWave) will be used in 5G and beyond.
Since the next generation network is not just a new radio access standard, but
instead an integration of networks for vertical markets with diverse
applications, answers to the question depend on scenarios and use cases to be
deployed. This paper gives four 5G mmWave deployment examples and describes in
chronological order the scenarios and use cases of their probable deployment,
including expected system architectures and hardware prototypes. The paper
starts with 28 GHz outdoor backhauling for fixed wireless access and moving
hotspots, which will be demonstrated at the PyeongChang winter Olympic games in
2018. The second deployment example is a 60 GHz unlicensed indoor access system
at the Tokyo-Narita airport, which is combined with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)
to enable ultra-high speed content download with low latency. The third example
is mmWave mesh network to be used as a micro Radio Access Network ({\mu}-RAN),
for cost-effective backhauling of small-cell Base Stations (BSs) in dense urban
scenarios. The last example is mmWave based Vehicular-to-Vehicular (V2V) and
Vehicular-to-Everything (V2X) communications system, which enables automated
driving by exchanging High Definition (HD) dynamic map information between cars
and Roadside Units (RSUs). For 5G and beyond, mmWave and MEC will play
important roles for a diverse set of applications that require both ultra-high
data rate and low latency communications.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel learning based method for automated
segmenta-tion of brain tumor in multimodal MRI images. The machine learned
features from fully convolutional neural network (FCN) and hand-designed texton
fea-tures are used to classify the MRI image voxels. The score map with
pixel-wise predictions is used as a feature map which is learned from
multimodal MRI train-ing dataset using the FCN. The learned features are then
applied to random for-ests to classify each MRI image voxel into normal brain
tissues and different parts of tumor. The method was evaluated on BRATS 2013
challenge dataset. The results show that the application of the random forest
classifier to multimodal MRI images using machine-learned features based on FCN
and hand-designed features based on textons provides promising segmentations.
The Dice overlap measure for automatic brain tumor segmentation against ground
truth is 0.88, 080 and 0.73 for complete tumor, core and enhancing tumor,
respectively.

analysis standard (CDVA) from the ISO/IEC moving pictures experts group (MPEG).
MPEG-CDVA targets at defining a standardized bitstream syntax to enable
interoperability in the context of video analysis applications. During the
developments of MPEGCDVA, a series of techniques aiming to reduce the
descriptor size and improve the video representation ability have been
proposed. This article describes the new standard that is being developed and
reports the performance of these key technical contributions.

 <dc:description>  Recent regulatory changes proposed by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) permitting unlicensed use of television white space (TVWS) channels
present new opportunities for designing wireless networks that make efficient
use of this spectrum. The favorable propagation characteristics of these
channels and their widespread availability, especially in rural areas, make
them well-suited for providing broadband services in sparsely populated regions
where economic factors hinder deployment of such services on licensed spectrum.
In this context, this paper explores the deployment of an outdoor Wi-Fi-like
network operating in TVWS channels, referred to commonly as a Super Wi-Fi
network. Since regulations governing unlicensed use of these channels allow (a)
mounting fixed devices up to a height of 30 m and operation at transmit powers
of up to 4 W EIRP, and (b) operation at transmit powers of up to 100 mW EIRP
for portable devices, such networks can provide extended coverage and higher
rates than traditional Wi-Fi networks. However, these gains are subject to the
viability of the uplink from the portable devices (clients) to the fixed
devices (access points (AP)) because of tighter restrictions on transmit power
of clients compared to APs. This paper leverages concepts from stochastic
geometry to study the performance of such networks with specific focus on the
effect of (a) transmit power asymmetry between APs and clients and its impact
on uplink viability and coverage, and (b) the interplay between height and
transmit power of APs in determining the network throughput. Such an analysis
reveals that (a) maximum coverage of no more than 700 m is obtained even when
APs are deployed at 30 m height, and (b) operating APs at transmit power of
more than 1 W is beneficial only at sparse deployment densities when rate is
prioritized over coverage.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a generalization of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) from low-dimensional grid data, such as images, to graph-structured
data. We propose a novel spatial convolution utilizing a random walk to uncover
the relations within the input, analogous to the way the standard convolution
uses the spatial neighborhood of a pixel on the grid. The convolution has an
intuitive interpretation, is efficient and scalable and can also be used on
data with varying graph structure. Furthermore, this generalization can be
applied to many standard regression or classification problems, by learning the
the underlying graph. We empirically demonstrate the performance of the
proposed CNN on MNIST, and challenge the state-of-the-art on Merck molecular
activity data set.

 <dc:description>  Electronic Health Records (EHR) are data generated during routine clinical
care. EHR offer researchers unprecedented phenotypic breadth and depth and have
the potential to accelerate the pace of precision medicine at scale. A main EHR
use-case is creating phenotyping algorithms to define disease status, onset and
severity. Currently, no common machine-readable standard exists for defining
phenotyping algorithms which often are stored in human-readable formats. As a
result, the translation of algorithms to implementation code is challenging and
sharing across the scientific community is problematic. In this paper, we
evaluate openEHR, a formal EHR data specification, for computable
representations of EHR phenotyping algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Optimal transportation provides a means of lifting distances between points
on a geometric domain to distances between signals over the domain, expressed
as probability distributions. On a graph, transportation problems can be used
to express challenging tasks involving matching supply to demand with minimal
shipment expense; in discrete language, these become minimum-cost network flow
problems. Regularization typically is needed to ensure uniqueness for the
linear ground distance case and to improve optimization convergence;
state-of-the-art techniques employ entropic regularization on the
transportation matrix. In this paper, we explore a quadratic alternative to
entropic regularization for transport over a graph. We theoretically analyze
the behavior of quadratically-regularized graph transport, characterizing how
regularization affects the structure of flows in the regime of small but
nonzero regularization. We further exploit elegant second-order structure in
the dual of this problem to derive an easily-implemented Newton-type
optimization algorithm.

 <dc:title>A Rate Adaptation Algorithm for Tile-based 360-degree Video Streaming</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the 360-degree immersive video, a user only views a part of the entire raw
video frame based on her viewing direction. However, today's 360-degree video
players always fetch the entire panoramic view regardless of users' head
movement, leading to significant bandwidth waste that can be potentially
avoided. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive streaming scheme for
360-degree videos. The basic idea is to fetch the invisible portion of a video
at the lowest quality based on users' head movement prediction and to
adaptively decide the video playback quality for the visible portion based on
bandwidth prediction. Doing both in a robust manner requires overcome a series
of challenges, such as jointly considering the spatial and temporal domains,
tolerating prediction errors, and achieving low complexity. To overcome these
challenges, we first define quality of experience (QoE) metrics for adaptive
360-degree video streaming. We then formulate an optimization problem and solve
it at a low complexity. The algorithm strategically leverages both future
bandwidth and the distribution of users' head positions to determine the
quality level of each tile (i.e., a sub-area of a raw frame). We further
provide theoretical proof showing that our algorithm achieves optimality under
practical assumptions. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms
significantly boost the user QoE by at least 20\% compared to baseline
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We propose an effective framework for multi-phase image segmentation and
semi-supervised data clustering by introducing a novel region force term into
the Potts model. Assume the probability that a pixel or a data point belongs to
each class is known a priori. We show that the corresponding indicator function
obeys the Bernoulli distribution and the new region force function can be
computed as the negative log-likelihood function under the Bernoulli
distribution. We solve the Potts model by the primal-dual hybrid gradient
method and the augmented Lagrangian method, which are based on two different
dual problems of the same primal problem. Empirical evaluations of the Potts
model with the new region force function on benchmark problems show that it is
competitive with existing variational methods in both image segmentation and
semi-supervised data clustering.

 <dc:title>Dynamic algorithms for visibility polygons</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Inkulu, R.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We devise the following dynamic algorithms for both maintaining as well as
querying for the visibility and weak visibility polygons amid vertex insertions
and/or deletions to the simple polygon.
  * A fully-dynamic algorithm for maintaining the visibility polygon of a fixed
point located interior to the simple polygon amid vertex insertions and
deletions to the simple polygon. The time complexity to update the visibility
polygon of a point $q$ due to the insertion (resp. deletion) of vertex $v$ to
(resp. from) the current simple polygon is expressed in terms of the number of
combinatorial changes needed to the visibility polygon of $q$ due to the
insertion (resp. deletion) of $v$.
  * An output-sensitive query algorithm to answer the visibility polygon query
corresponding to any point $p$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ amid vertex insertions and
deletions to the simple polygon. If $p$ is not exterior to the current simple
polygon then the visibility polygon of $p$ is computed. Otherwise, our
algorithm outputs the visibility polygon corresponding to the exterior
visibility of $p$.
  * An output-sensitive algorithm to compute the weak visibility polygon
corresponding to any query line segment located interior to the simple polygon
amid both the vertex insertions and deletions to the simple polygon.
  Each of these algorithms require preprocessing the initial simple polygon.
And, the algorithms that maintain the visibility polygon (resp. weak visibility
polygon) compute the visibility polygon (resp. weak visibility polygon) with
respect to the initial simple polygon during the preprocessing phase.

 <dc:description>  Wit is a quintessential form of rich inter-human interaction, and is often
grounded in a specific situation (e.g., a comment in response to an event). In
this work, we attempt to build computational models that can produce witty
descriptions for a given image. Inspired by a cognitive account of humor
appreciation, we employ linguistic wordplay, specifically puns. We compare our
approach against meaningful baseline approaches via human studies. In a Turing
test style evaluation, people find our model's description for an image to be
wittier than a human's witty description 55% of the time!

 <dc:description>  There is widespread sentiment that it is not possible to effectively utilize
fast gradient methods (e.g. Nesterov's acceleration, conjugate gradient, heavy
ball) for the purposes of stochastic optimization due to their instability and
error accumulation, a notion made precise in d'Aspremont 2008 and Devolder,
Glineur, and Nesterov 2014. This work considers these issues for the special
case of stochastic approximation for the least squares regression problem, and
our main result refutes the conventional wisdom by showing that acceleration
can be made robust to statistical errors. In particular, this work introduces
an accelerated stochastic gradient method that provably achieves the minimax
optimal statistical risk faster than stochastic gradient descent. Critical to
the analysis is a sharp characterization of accelerated stochastic gradient
descent as a stochastic process. We hope this characterization gives insights
towards the broader question of designing simple and effective accelerated
stochastic methods for more general convex and non-convex optimization
problems.

 <dc:description>  A word $w$ is \emph{extending} a subset of states $S$ of a deterministic
finite automaton, if the set of states mapped to $S$ by $w$ (the preimage of
$S$ under the action of $w$) is larger than $S$. This notion together with its
variations has particular importance in the field of synchronizing automata,
where a number of methods and algorithms rely on finding (short) extending
words. In this paper we study the complexity of several variants of extending
word problems: deciding whether there exists an extending word, an extending
word that extends to the whole set of states, a word avoiding a state, and a
word that either extends or shrinks the subset. Additionally, we study the
complexity of these problems when an upper bound on the length of the word is
also given, and we consider the subclasses of strongly connected,
synchronizing, binary, and unary automata. We show either hardness or
polynomial algorithms for the considered variants.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a new dynamic data structure for maintaining the strongly
connected components (SCCs) of a directed graph (digraph) under edge deletions,
so as to answer a rich repertoire of connectivity queries. Our main technical
contribution is a decremental data structure that supports sensitivity queries
of the form &quot;are $ u $ and $ v $ strongly connected in the graph $ G \setminus
w $?&quot;, for any triple of vertices $ u, v, w $, while $ G $ undergoes deletions
of edges. Our data structure processes a sequence of edge deletions in a
digraph with $n$ vertices in $O(m n \log{n})$ total time and $O(n^2 \log{n})$
space, where $m$ is the number of edges before any deletion, and answers the
above queries in constant time. We can leverage our data structure to obtain
decremental data structures for many more types of queries within the same time
and space complexity. For instance for edge-related queries, such as testing
whether two query vertices $u$ and $v$ are strongly connected in $G \setminus
e$, for some query edge $e$.
  As another important application of our decremental data structure, we
provide the first nontrivial algorithm for maintaining the dominator tree of a
flow graph under edge deletions. We present an algorithm that processes a
sequence of edge deletions in a flow graph in $O(m n \log{n})$ total time and
$O(n^2 \log{n})$ space. For reducible flow graphs we provide an $O(mn)$-time
and $O(m + n)$-space algorithm. We give a conditional lower bound that provides
evidence that these running times may be tight up to subpolynomial factors.

 <dc:description>  Next-generation supercomputers will feature more hierarchical and
heterogeneous memory systems with different memory technologies working
side-by-side. A critical question is whether at large scale existing HPC
applications and emerging data-analytics workloads will have performance
improvement or degradation on these systems. We propose a systematic and fair
methodology to identify the trend of application performance on emerging
hybrid-memory systems. We model the memory system of next-generation
supercomputers as a combination of &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; memories. We then analyze
performance and dynamic execution characteristics of a variety of workloads,
from traditional scientific applications to emerging data analytics to compare
traditional and hybrid-memory systems. Our results show that data analytics
applications can clearly benefit from the new system design, especially at
large scale. Moreover, hybrid-memory systems do not penalize traditional
scientific applications, which may also show performance improvement.

 <dc:title>The Complexity of Computing a Robust Flow</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Disser, Yann</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Robust network flows are a concept for dealing with uncertainty and
unforeseen failures in the network infrastructure. They and their dual
counterpart, network flow interdiction, have received steady attention within
the operations research community over the past years. One of the most basic
models is the Maximum Robust Flow Problem: Given a network and an integer k,
the task is to find a path flow of maximum robust value, i.e., the guaranteed
value of surviving flow after removal of any k arcs in the network. The
complexity of this problem appeared to have been settled almost a decade ago:
Aneja et al. (2001) showed that the problem can be solved efficiently when k =
1, while an article by Du and Chandrasekaran (2007) established that the
problem is NP-hard for any constant value of k larger than 1.
  We point to a flaw in the proof of the latter result, leaving the complexity
for constant k open once again. For the case that k is not bounded by a
constant, we present a new hardness proof, establishing that the problem is
strongly NP-hard, even when only two different capacity values occur and the
number of paths is polynomial in the size of the input. We further show that
computing optimal integral solutions is already NP-hard for k = 2 (whereas for
k=1, an efficient algorithm is known) and give a positive result for the case
that capacities are in {1, 2}.

 <dc:description>  Visual Question Answering (VQA) has received a lot of attention over the past
couple of years. A number of deep learning models have been proposed for this
task. However, it has been shown that these models are heavily driven by
superficial correlations in the training data and lack compositionality -- the
ability to answer questions about unseen compositions of seen concepts. This
compositionality is desirable and central to intelligence. In this paper, we
propose a new setting for Visual Question Answering where the test
question-answer pairs are compositionally novel compared to training
question-answer pairs. To facilitate developing models under this setting, we
present a new compositional split of the VQA v1.0 dataset, which we call
Compositional VQA (C-VQA). We analyze the distribution of questions and answers
in the C-VQA splits. Finally, we evaluate several existing VQA models under
this new setting and show that the performances of these models degrade by a
significant amount compared to the original VQA setting.

 <dc:description>  Idle periods on different processes of Message Passing applications are
unavoidable. While the origin of idle periods on a single process is well
understood as the effect of system and architectural random delays, yet it is
unclear how these idle periods propagate from one process to another. It is
important to understand idle period propagation in Message Passing applications
as it allows application developers to design communication patterns avoiding
idle period propagation and the consequent performance degradation in their
applications. To understand idle period propagation, we introduce a methodology
to trace idle periods when a process is waiting for data from a remote delayed
process in MPI applications. We apply this technique in an MPI application that
solves the heat equation to study idle period propagation on three different
systems. We confirm that idle periods move between processes in the form of
waves and that there are different stages in idle period propagation. Our
methodology enables us to identify a self-synchronization phenomenon that
occurs on two systems where some processes run slower than the other processes.

 <dc:description>  We consider relative error low rank approximation of {\it tensors} with
respect to the Frobenius norm: given an order-$q$ tensor $A \in
\mathbb{R}^{\prod_{i=1}^q n_i}$, output a rank-$k$ tensor $B$ for which
$\|A-B\|_F^2 \leq (1+\epsilon)$OPT, where OPT $= \inf_{\textrm{rank-}k~A'}
\|A-A'\|_F^2$. Despite the success on obtaining relative error low rank
approximations for matrices, no such results were known for tensors. One
structural issue is that there may be no rank-$k$ tensor $A_k$ achieving the
above infinum. Another, computational issue, is that an efficient relative
error low rank approximation algorithm for tensors would allow one to compute
the rank of a tensor, which is NP-hard. We bypass these issues via (1)
bicriteria and (2) parameterized complexity solutions:
  (1) We give an algorithm which outputs a rank $k' = O((k/\epsilon)^{q-1})$
tensor $B$ for which $\|A-B\|_F^2 \leq (1+\epsilon)$OPT in $nnz(A) + n \cdot
\textrm{poly}(k/\epsilon)$ time in the real RAM model. Here $nnz(A)$ is the
number of non-zero entries in $A$.
  (2) We give an algorithm for any $\delta &gt;0$ which outputs a rank $k$ tensor
$B$ for which $\|A-B\|_F^2 \leq (1+\epsilon)$OPT and runs in $ ( nnz(A) + n
\cdot \textrm{poly}(k/\epsilon) + \exp(k^2/\epsilon) ) \cdot n^\delta$ time in
the unit cost RAM model.
  For outputting a rank-$k$ tensor, or even a bicriteria solution with
rank-$Ck$ for a certain constant $C &gt; 1$, we show a $2^{\Omega(k^{1-o(1)})}$
time lower bound under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.
  Our results give the first relative error low rank approximations for tensors
for a large number of robust error measures for which nothing was known, as
well as column row and tube subset selection. We also obtain new results for
matrices, such as $nnz(A)$-time CUR decompositions, improving previous
$nnz(A)\log n$-time algorithms, which may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  In the context of variable selection, ensemble learning has gained increasing
interest due to its great potential to improve selection accuracy and to reduce
false discovery rate. A novel ordering-based selective ensemble learning
strategy is designed in this paper to obtain smaller but more accurate
ensembles. In particular, a greedy sorting strategy is proposed to rearrange
the order by which the members are included into the integration process.
Through stopping the fusion process early, a smaller subensemble with higher
selection accuracy can be obtained. More importantly, the sequential inclusion
criterion reveals the fundamental strength-diversity trade-off among ensemble
members. By taking stability selection (abbreviated as StabSel) as an example,
some experiments are conducted with both simulated and real-world data to
examine the performance of the novel algorithm. Experimental results
demonstrate that pruned StabSel generally achieves higher selection accuracy
and lower false discovery rates than StabSel and several other benchmark
methods.

 <dc:description>  Hardware accelerators have become a de-facto standard to achieve high
performance on current supercomputers and there are indications that this trend
will increase in the future. Modern accelerators feature high-bandwidth memory
next to the computing cores. For example, the Intel Knights Landing (KNL)
processor is equipped with 16 GB of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that works
together with conventional DRAM memory. Theoretically, HBM can provide 5x
higher bandwidth than conventional DRAM. However, many factors impact the
effective performance achieved by applications, including the application
memory access pattern, the problem size, the threading level and the actual
memory configuration. In this paper, we analyze the Intel KNL system and
quantify the impact of the most important factors on the application
performance by using a set of applications that are representative of
scientific and data-analytics workloads. Our results show that applications
with regular memory access benefit from MCDRAM, achieving up to 3x performance
when compared to the performance obtained using only DRAM. On the contrary,
applications with random memory access pattern are latency-bound and may suffer
from performance degradation when using only MCDRAM. For those applications,
the use of additional hardware threads may help hide latency and achieve higher
aggregated bandwidth when using HBM.

 <dc:description>  Cross-modal audio-visual perception has been a long-lasting topic in
psychology and neurology, and various studies have discovered strong
correlations in human perception of auditory and visual stimuli. Despite works
in computational multimodal modeling, the problem of cross-modal audio-visual
generation has not been systematically studied in the literature. In this
paper, we make the first attempt to solve this cross-modal generation problem
leveraging the power of deep generative adversarial training. Specifically, we
use conditional generative adversarial networks to achieve cross-modal
audio-visual generation of musical performances. We explore different encoding
methods for audio and visual signals, and work on two scenarios:
instrument-oriented generation and pose-oriented generation. Being the first to
explore this new problem, we compose two new datasets with pairs of images and
sounds of musical performances of different instruments. Our experiments using
both classification and human evaluations demonstrate that our model has the
ability to generate one modality, i.e., audio/visual, from the other modality,
i.e., visual/audio, to a good extent. Our experiments on various design choices
along with the datasets will facilitate future research in this new problem
space.

 <dc:description>  Abstractive summarization aims to generate a shorter version of the document
covering all the salient points in a compact and coherent fashion. On the other
hand, query-based summarization highlights those points that are relevant in
the context of a given query. The encode-attend-decode paradigm has achieved
notable success in machine translation, extractive summarization, dialog
systems, etc. But it suffers from the drawback of generation of repeated
phrases. In this work we propose a model for the query-based summarization task
based on the encode-attend-decode paradigm with two key additions (i) a query
attention model (in addition to document attention model) which learns to focus
on different portions of the query at different time steps (instead of using a
static representation for the query) and (ii) a new diversity based attention
model which aims to alleviate the problem of repeating phrases in the summary.
In order to enable the testing of this model we introduce a new query-based
summarization dataset building on debatepedia. Our experiments show that with
these two additions the proposed model clearly outperforms vanilla
encode-attend-decode models with a gain of 28\% (absolute) in ROUGE-L scores.

 <dc:description>  In this work a novel method to quantify spectral ergodicity for random
matrices is presented. The new methodology combines approaches rooted in the
metrics of Thirumalai-Mountain (TM) and Kullbach-Leibler (KL) divergence. The
method is applied to a general study of deep and recurrent neural networks via
the analysis of random matrix ensembles mimicking typical weight matrices of
those systems. In particular, we examine circular random matrix ensembles:
circular unitary ensemble (CUE), circular orthogonal ensemble (COE), and
circular symplectic ensemble (CSE). Eigenvalue spectra and spectral ergodicity
are computed for those ensembles as a function of network size. It is observed
that as the matrix size increases the level of spectral ergodicity of the
ensemble rises, i.e., the eigenvalue spectra obtained for a single realisation
at random from the ensemble is closer to the spectra obtained averaging over
the whole ensemble. Based on previous results we conjecture that success of
deep learning architectures is strongly bound to the concept of spectral
ergodicity. The method to compute spectral ergodicity proposed in this work
could be used to optimise the size and architecture of deep as well as
recurrent neural networks.

 <dc:title>Limits of End-to-End Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Glasmachers, Tobias</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  End-to-end learning refers to training a possibly complex learning system by
applying gradient-based learning to the system as a whole. End-to-end learning
system is specifically designed so that all modules are differentiable. In
effect, not only a central learning machine, but also all &quot;peripheral&quot; modules
like representation learning and memory formation are covered by a holistic
learning process. The power of end-to-end learning has been demonstrated on
many tasks, like playing a whole array of Atari video games with a single
architecture. While pushing for solutions to more challenging tasks, network
architectures keep growing more and more complex.
  In this paper we ask the question whether and to what extent end-to-end
learning is a future-proof technique in the sense of scaling to complex and
diverse data processing architectures. We point out potential inefficiencies,
and we argue in particular that end-to-end learning does not make optimal use
of the modular design of present neural networks. Our surprisingly simple
experiments demonstrate these inefficiencies, up to the complete breakdown of
learning.

 <dc:description>  Information in neural networks is represented as weighted connections, or
synapses, between neurons. This poses a problem as the primary computational
bottleneck for neural networks is the vector-matrix multiply when inputs are
multiplied by the neural network weights. Conventional processing architectures
are not well suited for simulating neural networks, often requiring large
amounts of energy and time. Additionally, synapses in biological neural
networks are not binary connections, but exhibit a nonlinear response function
as neurotransmitters are emitted and diffuse between neurons. Inspired by
neuroscience principles, we present a digital neuromorphic architecture, the
Spiking Temporal Processing Unit (STPU), capable of modeling arbitrary complex
synaptic response functions without requiring additional hardware components.
We consider the paradigm of spiking neurons with temporally coded information
as opposed to non-spiking rate coded neurons used in most neural networks. In
this paradigm we examine liquid state machines applied to speech recognition
and show how a liquid state machine with temporal dynamics maps onto the
STPU-demonstrating the flexibility and efficiency of the STPU for instantiating
neural algorithms.

 <dc:description>  In this thesis, we study two problems based on clustering algorithms. In the
first problem, we study the role of visual attributes using an agglomerative
clustering algorithm to whittle down the search area where the number of
classes is high to improve the performance of clustering. We observe that as we
add more attributes, the clustering performance increases overall. In the
second problem, we study the role of clustering in aggregating templates in a
1:N open set protocol using multi-shot video as a probe. We observe that by
increasing the number of clusters, the performance increases with respect to
the baseline and reaches a peak, after which increasing the number of clusters
causes the performance to degrade. Experiments are conducted using recently
introduced unconstrained IARPA Janus IJB-A, CS2, and CS3 face recognition
datasets.

 <dc:description>  Dynamic scene understanding is a challenging problem and motion segmentation
plays a crucial role in solving it. Incorporating semantics and motion enhances
the overall perception of the dynamic scene. For applications of outdoor
robotic navigation, joint learning methods have not been extensively used for
extracting spatio-temporal features or adding different priors into the
formulation. The task becomes even more challenging without stereo information
being incorporated. This paper proposes an approach to fuse semantic features
and motion clues using CNNs, to address the problem of monocular semantic
motion segmentation. We deduce semantic and motion labels by integrating
optical flow as a constraint with semantic features into dilated convolution
network. The pipeline consists of three main stages i.e Feature extraction,
Feature amplification and Multi Scale Context Aggregation to fuse the semantics
and flow features. Our joint formulation shows significant improvements in
monocular motion segmentation over the state of the art methods on challenging
KITTI tracking dataset.

efficiency and parallel scalability, developing effective programming models
that address the unique architecture features has presented many challenges. We
present here a distributed shared memory (DSM) model supported in software
transparently using C++ templated metaprogramming techniques. The approach
offers an extremely simple parallel programming model well suited for the
architecture. Initial results are presented that demonstrate the approach and
provide insight into the efficiency of the programming model and also the
ability of the NoC to support a DSM without explicit control over data movement
and localization.

 <dc:description>  Existing zero-shot learning (ZSL) models typically learn a projection
function from a feature space to a semantic embedding space (e.g.~attribute
space). However, such a projection function is only concerned with predicting
the training seen class semantic representation (e.g.~attribute prediction) or
classification. When applied to test data, which in the context of ZSL contains
different (unseen) classes without training data, a ZSL model typically suffers
from the project domain shift problem. In this work, we present a novel
solution to ZSL based on learning a Semantic AutoEncoder (SAE). Taking the
encoder-decoder paradigm, an encoder aims to project a visual feature vector
into the semantic space as in the existing ZSL models. However, the decoder
exerts an additional constraint, that is, the projection/code must be able to
reconstruct the original visual feature. We show that with this additional
reconstruction constraint, the learned projection function from the seen
classes is able to generalise better to the new unseen classes. Importantly,
the encoder and decoder are linear and symmetric which enable us to develop an
extremely efficient learning algorithm. Extensive experiments on six benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAE outperforms significantly the
existing ZSL models with the additional benefit of lower computational cost.
Furthermore, when the SAE is applied to supervised clustering problem, it also
beats the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  Hypothesis testing is a statistical inference framework for determining the
true distribution among a set of possible distributions for a given dataset.
Privacy restrictions may require the curator of the data or the respondents
themselves to share data with the test only after applying a randomizing
privacy mechanism. This work considers mutual information (MI) as the privacy
metric for measuring leakage. In addition, motivated by the Chernoff-Stein
lemma, the relative entropy between pairs of distributions of the output
(generated by the privacy mechanism) is chosen as the utility metric. For these
metrics, the goal is to find the optimal privacy-utility trade-off (PUT) and
the corresponding optimal privacy mechanism for both binary and m-ary
hypothesis testing. Focusing on the high privacy regime, Euclidean
information-theoretic approximations of the binary and m-ary PUT problems are
developed. The solutions for the approximation problems clarify that an
MI-based privacy metric preserves the privacy of the source symbols in inverse

 <dc:description>  Current measures of machine intelligence are either difficult to evaluate or
lack the ability to test a robot's problem-solving capacity in open worlds. We
propose a novel evaluation framework based on the formal notion of MacGyver
Test which provides a practical way for assessing the resilience and

 <dc:title>From Characters to Words to in Between: Do We Capture Morphology?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vania, Clara</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lopez, Adam</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Words can be represented by composing the representations of subword units
such as word segments, characters, and/or character n-grams. While such
representations are effective and may capture the morphological regularities of
words, they have not been systematically compared, and it is not understood how
they interact with different morphological typologies. On a language modeling
task, we present experiments that systematically vary (1) the basic unit of
representation, (2) the composition of these representations, and (3) the
morphological typology of the language modeled. Our results extend previous
findings that character representations are effective across typologies, and we
find that a previously unstudied combination of character trigram
representations composed with bi-LSTMs outperforms most others. But we also
find room for improvement: none of the character-level models match the
predictive accuracy of a model with access to true morphological analyses, even
when learned from an order of magnitude more data.

 <dc:title>An Improved Bound for Minimizing the Total Weighted Completion Time of
  Coflows in Datacenters</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shafiee, Mehrnoosh</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In data-parallel computing frameworks, intermediate parallel data is often
produced at various stages which needs to be transferred among servers in the
datacenter network (e.g. the shuffle phase in MapReduce). A stage often cannot
start or be completed unless all the required data pieces from the preceding
stage are received. \emph{Coflow} is a recently proposed networking abstraction
to capture such communication patterns. We consider the problem of efficiently
scheduling coflows with release dates in a shared datacenter network so as to
minimize the total weighted completion time of coflows.
  Several heuristics have been proposed recently to address this problem, as
well as a few polynomial-time approximation algorithms with provable
performance guarantees. Our main result in this paper is a polynomial-time
deterministic algorithm that improves the prior known results. Specifically, we
propose a deterministic algorithm with approximation ratio of $5$, which
improves the prior best known ratio of $12$. For the special case when all
coflows are released at time zero, our deterministic algorithm obtains
approximation ratio of $4$ which improves the prior best known ratio of $8$.
The key ingredient of our approach is an improved linear program formulation
for sorting the coflows followed by a simple list scheduling policy. Extensive
simulation results, using both synthetic and real traffic traces, are presented
that verify the performance of our algorithm and show improvement over the
prior approaches.

 <dc:description>  Evolution and propagation of the world's languages is a complex phenomenon,
driven, to a large extent, by social interactions. Multilingual society can be
seen as a system of interacting agents, where the interaction leads to a
modification of the language spoken by the individuals. Two people can reach
the state of full linguistic compatibility due to the positive interactions,
like transfer of loanwords. But, on the other hand, if they speak entirely
different languages, they will separate from each other. These simple
observations make the network science the most suitable framework to describe
and analyze dynamics of language change. Although many mechanisms have been
explained, we lack a qualitative description of the scaling behavior for
different sizes of a population. Here we address the issue of the language
diversity in societies of different sizes, and we show that local interactions
are crucial to capture characteristics of the empirical data. We propose a
model of social interactions, extending the idea from, that explains the growth
of the language diversity with the size of a population of country or society.
We argue that high clustering and network disintegration are the most important
characteristics of models properly describing empirical data. Furthermore, we
cancel the contradiction between previous models and the Solomon Islands case.
Our results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the
rewiring mechanism in the process of language change.

 <dc:title>Identifying Similarities in Epileptic Patients for Drug Resistance

 <dc:creator>Von Dollen, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Currently, approximately 30% of epileptic patients treated with antiepileptic
drugs (AEDs) remain resistant to treatment (known as refractory patients). This
project seeks to understand the underlying similarities in refractory patients
vs. other epileptic patients, identify features contributing to drug resistance
across underlying phenotypes for refractory patients, and develop predictive
models for drug resistance in epileptic patients. In this study, epileptic
patient data was examined to attempt to observe discernable similarities or
differences in refractory patients (case) and other non-refractory patients
(control) to map underlying mechanisms in causality. For the first part of the
study, unsupervised algorithms such as Kmeans, Spectral Clustering, and
Gaussian Mixture Models were used to examine patient features projected into a
lower dimensional space. Results from this study showed a high degree of
non-linearity in the underlying feature space. For the second part of this
study, classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosted
Decision Trees, and SVMs, were tested on the reduced-dimensionality features,
with accuracy results of 0.83(+/-0.3) testing using 7 fold cross validation.
Observations of test results indicate using a radial basis function kernel PCA
to reduce features ingested by a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree Ensemble lead
to gains in improved accuracy in mapping a binary decision to highly non-linear
features collected from epileptic patients.

 <dc:description>  In machine learning, the use of an artificial neural network is the
mainstream approach. Such a network consists of layers of neurons. These
neurons are of the same type characterized by the two features: (1) an inner
product of an input vector and a matching weighting vector of trainable
parameters and (2) a nonlinear excitation function. Here we investigate the
possibility of replacing the inner product with a quadratic function of the
input vector, thereby upgrading the 1st order neuron to the 2nd order neuron,
empowering individual neurons, and facilitating the optimization of neural
networks. Also, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the feasibility
and merits of the 2nd order neurons. Finally, further topics are discussed.

 <dc:description>  In this manuscript we present a fast GPU implementation for tomographic
reconstruction of large datasets using data obtained at the Brazilian
synchrotron light source. The algorithm is distributed in a cluster with 4 GPUs
through a fast pipeline implemented in C programming language. Our algorithm is
theoretically based on a recently discovered low complexity formula, computing
the total volume within O(N3logN) floating point operations; much less than
traditional algorithms that operates with O(N4) flops over an input data of
size O(N3). The results obtained with real data indicate that a reconstruction
can be achieved within 1 second provided the data is transferred completely to
the memory.

 <dc:description>  A new approach to turbulence simulation, based on a combination of large-eddy
simulation (LES) for the whole flow and an array of non-space-filling
quasi-direct numerical simulations (QDNS), which sample the response of
near-wall turbulence to large-scale forcing, is proposed and evaluated. The
technique overcomes some of the cost limitations of turbulence simulation,
since the main flow is treated with a coarse-grid LES, with the equivalent of
wall functions supplied by the near-wall sampled QDNS. Two cases are tested, at
friction Reynolds number Re$_\tau$=4200 and 20,000. The total grid node count
for the first case is less than half a million and less than two million for
the second case, with the calculations only requiring a desktop computer. A
good agreement with published DNS is found at Re$_\tau$=4200, both in terms of
the mean velocity profile and the streamwise velocity fluctuation statistics,
which correctly show a substantial increase in near-wall turbulence levels due
to a modulation of near-wall streaks by large-scale structures. The trend
continues at Re$_\tau$=20,000, in agreement with experiment, which represents
one of the major achievements of the new approach. A number of detailed aspects
of the model, including numerical resolution, LES-QDNS coupling strategy and
sub-grid model are explored. A low level of grid sensitivity is demonstrated
for both the QDNS and LES aspects. Since the method does not assume a law of
the wall, it can in principle be applied to flows that are out of equilibrium.

 <dc:title>Deep Convolutional Neural Network to Detect J-UNIWARD</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an empirical study on applying convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) to detecting J-UNIWARD, one of the most secure JPEG
steganographic method. Experiments guiding the architectural design of the CNNs
have been conducted on the JPEG compressed BOSSBase containing 10,000 covers of
size 512x512. Results have verified that both the pooling method and the depth
of the CNNs are critical for performance. Results have also proved that a
20-layer CNN, in general, outperforms the most sophisticated feature-based
methods, but its advantage gradually diminishes on hard-to-detect cases. To
show that the performance generalizes to large-scale databases and to different
cover sizes, one experiment has been conducted on the CLS-LOC dataset of
ImageNet containing more than one million covers cropped to unified size of
256x256. The proposed 20-layer CNN has cut the error achieved by a CNN recently
proposed for large-scale JPEG steganalysis by 35%. Source code is available via

 <dc:description>  Sequence-to-sequence models have shown strong performance across a broad
range of applications. However, their application to parsing and generating
text usingAbstract Meaning Representation (AMR)has been limited, due to the
relatively limited amount of labeled data and the non-sequential nature of the
AMR graphs. We present a novel training procedure that can lift this limitation
using millions of unlabeled sentences and careful preprocessing of the AMR
graphs. For AMR parsing, our model achieves competitive results of 62.1SMATCH,
the current best score reported without significant use of external semantic
resources. For AMR generation, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance of BLEU 33.8. We present extensive ablative and qualitative
analysis including strong evidence that sequence-based AMR models are robust
against ordering variations of graph-to-sequence conversions.

 <dc:subject>I.2.10</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work introduces a novel framework for quantifying the presence and
strength of recurrent dynamics in video data. Specifically, we provide
continuous measures of periodicity (perfect repetition) and quasiperiodicity
(superposition of periodic modes with non-commensurate periods), in a way which
does not require segmentation, training, object tracking or 1-dimensional
surrogate signals. Our methodology operates directly on video data. The
approach combines ideas from nonlinear time series analysis (delay embeddings)
and computational topology (persistent homology), by translating the problem of
finding recurrent dynamics in video data, into the problem of determining the
circularity or toroidality of an associated geometric space. Through extensive
testing, we show the robustness of our scores with respect to several noise
models/levels, we show that our periodicity score is superior to other methods
when compared to human-generated periodicity rankings, and furthermore, we show
that our quasiperiodicity score clearly indicates the presence of biphonation
in videos of vibrating vocal folds, which has never before been accomplished
end to end quantitatively.

 <dc:description>  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have achieved great success in the
genetic study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Collaborative imaging genetics
studies across different research institutions show the effectiveness of
detecting genetic risk factors. However, the high dimensionality of GWAS data
poses significant challenges in detecting risk SNPs for AD. Selecting relevant
features is crucial in predicting the response variable. In this study, we
propose a novel Distributed Feature Selection Framework (DFSF) to conduct the
large-scale imaging genetics studies across multiple institutions. To speed up
the learning process, we propose a family of distributed group Lasso screening
rules to identify irrelevant features and remove them from the optimization.
Then we select the relevant group features by performing the group Lasso
feature selection process in a sequence of parameters. Finally, we employ the
stability selection to rank the top risk SNPs that might help detect the early
stage of AD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first distributed
feature selection model integrated with group Lasso feature selection as well

 <dc:description>  Existing question answering methods infer answers either from a knowledge
base or from raw text. While knowledge base (KB) methods are good at answering
compositional questions, their performance is often affected by the
incompleteness of the KB. Au contraire, web text contains millions of facts
that are absent in the KB, however in an unstructured form. {\it Universal
schema} can support reasoning on the union of both structured KBs and
unstructured text by aligning them in a common embedded space. In this paper we
extend universal schema to natural language question answering, employing
\emph{memory networks} to attend to the large body of facts in the combination
of text and KB. Our models can be trained in an end-to-end fashion on
question-answer pairs. Evaluation results on \spades fill-in-the-blank question
answering dataset show that exploiting universal schema for question answering
is better than using either a KB or text alone. This model also outperforms the
current state-of-the-art by 8.5 $F_1$ points.\footnote{Code and data available

 <dc:description>  We introduce a neural semantic parser that converts natural language
utterances to intermediate representations in the form of predicate-argument
structures, which are induced with a transition system and subsequently mapped
to target domains. The semantic parser is trained end-to-end using annotated
logical forms or their denotations. We obtain competitive results on various
datasets. The induced predicate-argument structures shed light on the types of
representations useful for semantic parsing and how these are different from
linguistically motivated ones.

 <dc:description>  With the recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), various
organizations and individuals started debating about the progress of AI as a
blessing or a curse for the future of the society. This paper conducts an
investigation on how the public perceives the progress of AI by utilizing the
data shared on Twitter. Specifically, this paper performs a comparative
analysis on the understanding of users from two categories -- general
AI-Tweeters (AIT) and the expert AI-Tweeters (EAIT) who share posts about AI on
Twitter. Our analysis revealed that users from both the categories express
distinct emotions and interests towards AI. Users from both the categories
regard AI as positive and are optimistic about the progress of AI but the
experts are more negative than the general AI-Tweeters. Characterization of
users manifested that `London' is the popular location of users from where they
tweet about AI. Tweets posted by AIT are highly retweeted than posts made by
EAIT that reveals greater diffusion of information from AIT.

 <dc:description>  Swarms of robots will revolutionize many industrial applications, from
targeted material delivery to precision farming. Controlling the motion and
behavior of these swarms presents unique challenges for human operators, who
cannot yet effectively convey their high-level intentions to a group of robots
in application. This work proposes a new human-swarm interface based on novel
wearable gesture-control and haptic-feedback devices. This work seeks to
combine a wearable gesture recognition device that can detect high-level
intentions, a portable device that can detect Cartesian information and finger
movements, and a wearable advanced haptic device that can provide real-time
feedback. This project is the first to envisage a wearable Human-Swarm
Interaction (HSI) interface that separates the input and feedback components of
the classical control loop (input, output, feedback), as well as being the
first of its kind suitable for both indoor and outdoor environments.

 <dc:description>  Clone-and-own approach is a natural way of source code reuse for software
developers. To assess how known bugs and security vulnerabilities of a cloned
component affect an application, developers and security analysts need to
identify an original version of the component and understand how the cloned
component is different from the original one. Although developers may record
the original version information in a version control system and/or directory
names, such information is often either unavailable or incomplete. In this
research, we propose a code search method that takes as input a set of source
files and extracts all the components including similar files from a software
ecosystem (i.e., a collection of existing versions of software packages). Our
method employs an efficient file similarity computation using b-bit minwise
hashing technique. We use an aggregated file similarity for ranking components.
To evaluate the effectiveness of this tool, we analyzed 75 cloned components in
Firefox and Android source code. The tool took about two hours to report the
original components from 10 million files in Debian GNU/Linux packages. Recall
of the top-five components in the extracted lists is 0.907, while recall of a
baseline using SHA-1 file hash is 0.773, according to the ground truth recorded
in the source code repositories.

 <dc:description>  Reversible logic has two main properties. First, the number of inputs is
equal to the number of outputs. Second, it implements a one-to-one mapping;
i.e., one can reconstruct the inputs from the outputs. These properties enable
its applications in building quantum computing architectures.
  In this paper, we study reverse engineering of reversible logic circuits,
including reverse engineering of non-reversible functions embedded into
reversible circuits. We propose the number of embeddings of non-reversible
functions into a reversible circuit as the security metric for reverse
engineering. We analyze the security benefits of automatic synthesis of
reversible circuits. We use our proposed security metric to show that the
functional synthesis approaches yield reversible circuits that are more
resilient to reverse engineering than the structural synthesis approaches.
Finally, we propose scrambling of the inputs and outputs of a reversible
circuit to thwart reverse engineering.

 <dc:description>  Test case maintainability is an important concern, especially in open source
and distributed development environments where projects typically have high
contributor turnover with varying backgrounds and experience, and where code
ownership changes often. Similar to design patterns, patterns for unit testing
promote maintainability quality attributes such as ease of diagnoses,
modifiability, and comprehension. In this paper, we report the results of a
large-scale study on the usage of four xUnit testing patterns which can be used
to satisfy these maintainability attributes. This is a first-of-its-kind study
which developed automated techniques to investigate these issues across 82,447
open source projects, and the findings provide more insight into testing
practices in open source projects. Our results indicate that only 17% of
projects had test cases, and from the 251 testing frameworks we studied, 93 of
them were being used. We found 24% of projects with test files implemented
patterns that could help with maintainability, while the remaining did not use
these patterns. Multiple qualitative analyses indicate that usage of patterns
was an ad-hoc decision by individual developers, rather than motivated by the
characteristics of the project, and that developers sometimes used alternative
techniques to address maintainability concerns.

 <dc:description>  Word embeddings provide point representations of words containing useful
semantic information. We introduce multimodal word distributions formed from
Gaussian mixtures, for multiple word meanings, entailment, and rich uncertainty
information. To learn these distributions, we propose an energy-based
max-margin objective. We show that the resulting approach captures uniquely
expressive semantic information, and outperforms alternatives, such as word2vec
skip-grams, and Gaussian embeddings, on benchmark datasets such as word
similarity and entailment.

 <dc:title>A GRU-Gated Attention Model for Neural Machine Translation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Neural machine translation (NMT) heavily relies on an attention network to
produce a context vector for each target word prediction. In practice, we find
that context vectors for different target words are quite similar to one
another and therefore are insufficient in discriminatively predicting target
words. The reason for this might be that context vectors produced by the
vanilla attention network are just a weighted sum of source representations
that are invariant to decoder states. In this paper, we propose a novel
GRU-gated attention model (GAtt) for NMT which enhances the degree of
discrimination of context vectors by enabling source representations to be
sensitive to the partial translation generated by the decoder. GAtt uses a
gated recurrent unit (GRU) to combine two types of information: treating a
source annotation vector originally produced by the bidirectional encoder as
the history state while the corresponding previous decoder state as the input
to the GRU. The GRU-combined information forms a new source annotation vector.
In this way, we can obtain translation-sensitive source representations which
are then feed into the attention network to generate discriminative context
vectors. We further propose a variant that regards a source annotation vector
as the current input while the previous decoder state as the history.
Experiments on NIST Chinese-English translation tasks show that both GAtt-based
models achieve significant improvements over the vanilla attentionbased NMT.
Further analyses on attention weights and context vectors demonstrate the
effectiveness of GAtt in improving the discrimination power of representations
and handling the challenging issue of over-translation.

 <dc:title>DeepCCI: End-to-end Deep Learning for Chemical-Chemical Interaction
  Prediction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kwon, Sunyoung</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) plays a key role in predicting candidate
drugs, toxicity, therapeutic effects, and biological functions. In various
types of chemical analyses, computational approaches are often required due to
the amount of data that needs to be handled. The recent remarkable growth and
outstanding performance of deep learning have attracted considerable research
attention. However,even in state-of-the-art drug analysis methods, deep
learning continues to be used only as a classifier, although deep learning is
capable of not only simple classification but also automated feature
extraction. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end learning method for
CCI, named DeepCCI. Hidden features are derived from a simplified molecular
input line entry system (SMILES), which is a string notation representing the
chemical structure, instead of learning from crafted features. To discover
hidden representations for the SMILES strings, we use convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). To guarantee the commutative property for homogeneous
interaction, we apply model sharing and hidden representation merging
techniques. The performance of DeepCCI was compared with a plain deep
classifier and conventional machine learning methods. The proposed DeepCCI
showed the best performance in all seven evaluation metrics used. In addition,
the commutative property was experimentally validated. The automatically
extracted features through end-to-end SMILES learning alleviates the
significant efforts required for manual feature engineering. It is expected to
improve prediction performance, in drug analyses.

 <dc:description>  In the modern era where highly-commodified cultural products compete heavily
for mass consumption, finding the principles behind the complex process of how
successful, &quot;hit&quot; products emerge remains a vital scientific goal that requires
an interdisciplinary approach. Here we present a framework for tracing the
cycle of prosperity-and-decline of a product to find insights into influential
and potent factors that determine its success. As a rapid, high-throughput
indicator of the preference of the public, popularity charts have emerged as a
useful information source for finding the market performance patterns of
products over time, which we call the on-chart life trajectories that show how
the products enter the chart, fare inside it, and eventually exit from it. We
propose quantitative parameters to characterise a life trajectory, and analyse
a large-scale data set of nearly 7,000 songs from Gaon Chart, a major weekly
Korean Pop (K-Pop) chart that cover a span of six years. We find that a
significant role is played by non-musical extrinsic factors such as the might
of production companies and possibly established fan base in the on-chart
success of songs, strongly indicative of the commodified nature of modern
cultural products. We also discuss several nontrivial yet intriguing
trajectories that we call the &quot;Late Bloomers&quot; and the &quot;Re-entrants&quot; that
appears to be strongly driven by serendipitous exposure on mass media and the
changes of seasons.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances of next generation sequencing technologies have facilitated
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to be used as a novel covert channel in
steganography. There exist various methods in other domains to detect hidden
messages in conventional covert channels, however, they have not been applied
to DNA steganography. The current most common detection schemes, frequency
analysis-based methods, often miss the important signals when directly applied
to DNA steganography since the methods depend on the distribution of the number
of sequence characters. To address the existing limitation, we propose a
general sequence learning-based DNA steganalysis framework. Our approach learns
intrinsic distribution of coding and non-coding sequences and detects hidden
messages by exploiting distribution variations after hiding messages. Using
deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs), our framework identifies the
distribution variations by using the classification score whether a sequence is
to be a coding or non-coding sequence. We compared our method to various
existing methods and biological sequence analysis methods implemented on top of
our framework. According to our experimental results, our approach delivers a
robust detection performance regardless of sequence lengths.

 <dc:description>  A novel landmark-based oracle (CFLAT) is presented, which provides
earliest-arrival-time route plans in time-dependent road networks. To our
knowledge, this is the first oracle that preprocesses combinatorial structures
(collections of time-stamped min-travel-time-path trees) rather than
travel-time functions. The preprocessed data structure is exploited by a new
query algorithm (CFCA) which computes (and pays for it), apart from
earliest-arrival-time estimations, the actual connecting path that preserves
the theoretical approximation guarantees. To make it practical and tackle the
main burden of landmark-based oracles (the large preprocessing requirements),
CFLAT is extensively engineered. A thorough experimental evaluation on two
real-world benchmark instances shows that CFLAT achieves a significant
improvement on preprocessing, approximation guarantees and query-times, in
comparison to previous landmark-based oracles, whose query algorithms do not
account for the path construction. It also achieves competitive query-time
performance and approximation guarantees compared to state-of-art speedup
heuristics for time-dependent road networks, whose query-times in most cases do
not account for path construction.

 <dc:description>  Learning on Grassmann manifold has become popular in many computer vision
tasks, with the strong capability to extract discriminative information for
imagesets and videos. However, such learning algorithms particularly on
high-dimensional Grassmann manifold always involve with significantly high
computational cost, which seriously limits the applicability of learning on
Grassmann manifold in more wide areas. In this research, we propose an
unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm on Grassmann manifold based on
the Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) criterion. LPP is a commonly used
dimensionality reduction algorithm for vector-valued data, aiming to preserve
local structure of data in the dimension-reduced space. The strategy is to
construct a mapping from higher dimensional Grassmann manifold into the one in
a relative low-dimensional with more discriminative capability. The proposed
method can be optimized as a basic eigenvalue problem. The performance of our
proposed method is assessed on several classification and clustering tasks and
the experimental results show its clear advantages over other Grassmann based
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We consider the communication complexity of finding an approximate maximum
matching in a graph in a multi-party message-passing communication model. The
maximum matching problem is one of the most fundamental graph combinatorial
problems, with a variety of applications.
  The input to the problem is a graph $G$ that has $n$ vertices and the set of
edges partitioned over $k$ sites, and an approximation ratio parameter
$\alpha$. The output is required to be a matching in $G$ that has to be
reported by one of the sites, whose size is at least factor $\alpha$ of the
size of a maximum matching in $G$.
  We show that the communication complexity of this problem is $\Omega(\alpha^2
k n)$ information bits. This bound is shown to be tight up to a $\log n$
factor, by constructing an algorithm, establishing its correctness, and an
upper bound on the communication cost. The lower bound also applies to other
graph combinatorial problems in the message-passing communication model,
including max-flow and graph sparsification.

 <dc:description>  A ranking is an ordered sequence of items, in which an item with higher
ranking score is more preferred than the items with lower ranking scores. In
many information systems, rankings are widely used to represent the preferences
over a set of items or candidates. The consensus measure of rankings is the
problem of how to evaluate the degree to which the rankings agree. The
consensus measure can be used to evaluate rankings in many information systems,
as quite often there is not ground truth available for evaluation.
  This paper introduces a novel approach for consensus measure of rankings by
using graph representation, in which the vertices or nodes are the items and
the edges are the relationship of items in the rankings. Such representation
leads to various algorithms for consensus measure in terms of different aspects
of rankings, including the number of common patterns, the number of common
patterns with fixed length and the length of the longest common patterns. The
proposed measure can be adopted for various types of rankings, such as full
rankings, partial rankings and rankings with ties. This paper demonstrates how
the proposed approaches can be used to evaluate the quality of rank aggregation
and the quality of top-$k$ rankings from Google and Bing search engines.

 <dc:title>Linear-Size Hopsets with Small Hopbound, and Distributed Routing with

 <dc:creator>Elkin, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Neiman, Ofer</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For a positive parameter $\beta$, the $\beta$-bounded distance between a pair
of vertices $u,v$ in a weighted undirected graph $G = (V,E,\omega)$ is the
length of the shortest $u-v$ path in $G$ with at most $\beta$ edges, aka {\em
hops}. For $\beta$ as above and $\epsilon&gt;0$, a {\em $(\beta,\epsilon)$-hopset}
of $G = (V,E,\omega)$ is a graph $G' =(V,H,\omega_H)$ on the same vertex set,
such that all distances in $G$ are $(1+\epsilon)$-approximated by
$\beta$-bounded distances in $G\cup G'$.
  Hopsets are a fundamental graph-theoretic and graph-algorithmic construct,
and they are widely used for distance-related problems in a variety of
computational settings. Currently existing constructions of hopsets produce
hopsets either with $\Omega(n \log n)$ edges, or with a hopbound
$n^{\Omega(1)}$. In this paper we devise a construction of {\em linear-size}
hopsets with hopbound $(\log n)^{\log^{(3)}n+O(1)}$. This improves the previous
bound almost exponentially.
  We also devise efficient implementations of our construction in PRAM and
distributed settings. The only existing PRAM algorithm \cite{EN16} for
computing hopsets with a constant (i.e., independent of $n$) hopbound requires
$n^{\Omega(1)}$ time. We devise a PRAM algorithm with polylogarithmic running
time for computing hopsets with a constant hopbound, i.e., our running time is
exponentially better than the previous one. Moreover, these hopsets are also
significantly sparser than their counterparts from \cite{EN16}.
  We use our hopsets to devise a distributed routing scheme that exhibits
near-optimal tradeoff between individual memory requirement
$\tilde{O}(n^{1/k})$ of vertices throughout preprocessing and routing phases of
the algorithm, and stretch $O(k)$, along with a near-optimal construction time
$\approx D + n^{1/2 + 1/k}$, where $D$ is the hop-diameter of the input graph.

 <dc:description>  A general class of nonlinear Least Square Error (LSE) precoders in multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output systems is analyzed using the replica method
from statistical mechanics. A single cell downlink channel with $N$ transmit
antennas at the base station and $K$ single-antenna users is considered. The
data symbols are assumed to be iid Gaussian and the precoded symbols on each
transmit antenna are restricted to be chosen from a predefined set
$\mathbb{X}$. The set $\mathbb{X}$ encloses several well-known constraints in
wireless communications including signals with peak power, constant envelope
signals and finite constellations such as Phase Shift Keying (PSK). We
determine the asymptotic distortion of the LSE precoder under both the Replica
Symmetry (RS) and the one step Replica Symmetry Breaking (1-RSB) assumptions.
For the case of peak power constraint on each transmit antenna, our analyses
under the RS assumption show that the LSE precoder can reduce the peak to
average power ratio to 3dB without any significant performance loss. For PSK
constellations, as $N/K$ grows, the RS assumption fails to predict the
performance accurately and therefore, investigations under the 1-RSB assumption
are further considered. The results show that the 1-RSB assumption is more
accurate.

 <dc:description>  Through the development of efficient algorithms, data structures and
preprocessing techniques, real-world shortest path problems in street networks
are now very fast to solve. But in reality, the exact travel times along each
arc in the network may not be known. This lead to the development of robust
shortest path problems, where all possible arc travel times are contained in a
so-called uncertainty set of possible outcomes.
  Research in robust shortest path problems typically assumes this set to be
given, and provides complexity results as well as algorithms depending on its
shape. However, what can actually be observed in real-world problems are only
discrete raw data points. The shape of the uncertainty is already a modelling
assumption. In this paper we test several of the most widely used assumptions
on the uncertainty set using real-world traffic measurements provided by the
City of Chicago. We calculate the resulting different robust solutions, and
evaluate which uncertainty approach is actually reasonable for our data. This
anchors theoretical research in a real-world application and allows us to point
out which robust models should be the future focus of algorithmic development.

 <dc:description>  Consider a fading Gaussian MIMO channel with $N_\mathrm{t}$ transmit and
$N_\mathrm{r}$ receive antennas. The transmitter selects $L_\mathrm{t}$
antennas corresponding to the strongest channels. For this setup, we study the
distribution of the input-output mutual information when $N_\mathrm{t}$ grows
large. We show that, for any $N_\mathrm{r}$ and $L_\mathrm{t}$, the
distribution of the input-output mutual information is accurately approximated
by a Gaussian distribution whose mean grows large and whose variance converges
to zero. Our analysis depicts that, in the large limit, the gap between the
expectation of the mutual information and its corresponding upper bound,
derived by applying Jensen's inequality, converges to a constant which only
depends on $N_\mathrm{r}$ and $L_\mathrm{t}$. The result extends the scope of
channel hardening to the general case of antenna selection with multiple
receive and selected transmit antennas. Although the analyses are given for the
large-system limit, our numerical investigations indicate the robustness of the
approximated distribution even when the number of antennas is not large.

 <dc:description>  Version information plays an important role in spreadsheet understanding,
maintaining and quality improving. However, end users rarely use version
control tools to document spreadsheet version information. Thus, the
spreadsheet version information is missing, and different versions of a
spreadsheet coexist as individual and similar spreadsheets. Existing approaches
try to recover spreadsheet version information through clustering these similar
spreadsheets based on spreadsheet filenames or related email conversation.
However, the applicability and accuracy of existing clustering approaches are
limited due to the necessary information (e.g., filenames and email
conversation) is usually missing. We inspected the versioned spreadsheets in
VEnron, which is extracted from the Enron Corporation. In VEnron, the different
versions of a spreadsheet are clustered into an evolution group. We observed
that the versioned spreadsheets in each evolution group exhibit certain common
features (e.g., similar table headers and worksheet names). Based on this
observation, we proposed an automatic clustering algorithm, SpreadCluster.
SpreadCluster learns the criteria of features from the versioned spreadsheets
in VEnron, and then automatically clusters spreadsheets with the similar
features into the same evolution group. We applied SpreadCluster on all
spreadsheets in the Enron corpus. The evaluation result shows that
SpreadCluster could cluster spreadsheets with higher precision and recall rate
than the filename-based approach used by VEnron. Based on the clustering result
by SpreadCluster, we further created a new versioned spreadsheet corpus
VEnron2, which is much bigger than VEnron. We also applied SpreadCluster on the
other two spreadsheet corpora FUSE and EUSES. The results show that
SpreadCluster can cluster the versioned spreadsheets in these two corpora with
high precision.

 <dc:title>Combinatorial Cost Sharing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We introduce a combinatorial variant of the cost sharing problem: several
services can be provided to each player and each player values every
combination of services differently. A publicly known cost function specifies
the cost of providing every possible combination of services. A combinatorial
cost sharing mechanism is a protocol that decides which services each player
gets and at what price. We look for dominant strategy mechanisms that are
(economically) efficient and cover the cost, ideally without overcharging
(i.e., budget balanced). Note that unlike the standard cost sharing setting,
combinatorial cost sharing is a multi-parameter domain. This makes designing
dominant strategy mechanisms with good guarantees a challenging task.
  We present the Potential Mechanism -- a combination of the VCG mechanism and
a well-known tool from the theory of cooperative games: Hart and Mas-Colell's
potential function. The potential mechanism is a dominant strategy mechanism
that always covers the incurred cost. When the cost function is subadditive the
same mechanism is also approximately efficient. Our main technical contribution
shows that when the cost function is submodular the potential mechanism is
approximately budget balanced in three settings: supermodular valuations,
symmetric cost function and general symmetric valuations, and two players with
general valuations.

 <dc:description>  A unique sink orientation (USO) is an orientation of the $n$-dimensional cube
graph ($n$-cube) such that every face (subcube) has a unique sink. The number
of unique sink orientations is $n^{\Theta(2^n)}$. If a cube orientation is not
a USO, it contains a pseudo unique sink orientation (PUSO): an orientation of
some subcube such that every proper face of it has a unique sink, but the
subcube itself hasn't. In this paper, we characterize and count PUSOs of the
$n$-cube. We show that PUSOs have a much more rigid structure than USOs and
that their number is between $2^{\Omega(2^{n-\log n})}$ and $2^{O(2^n)}$ which
is negligible compared to the number of USOs. As tools, we introduce and
characterize two new classes of USOs: border USOs (USOs that appear as facets
of PUSOs), and odd USOs which are dual to border USOs but easier to understand.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Suppose a large scale quantum computer becomes available over the Internet.
Could we delegate universal quantum computations to this server, using only
classical communication between client and server, in a way that is
information-theoretically blind (i.e., the server learns nothing about the
input apart from its size, with no cryptographic assumptions required)? In this
paper we give strong indications that the answer is no. This contrasts with the
situation where quantum communication between client and server is allowed ---
where we know that such information-theoretically blind quantum computation is
possible. It also contrasts with the case where cryptographic assumptions are
allowed: there again, it is now known that there are quantum analogues of fully
homomorphic encryption. In more detail, we observe that, if there exist
information-theoretically secure classical schemes for performing universal
quantum computations on encrypted data, then we get unlikely containments
between complexity classes, such as ${\sf BQP} \subset {\sf NP/poly}$.
Moreover, we prove that having such schemes for delegating quantum sampling
problems, such as Boson Sampling, would lead to a collapse of the polynomial
hierarchy. We then consider encryption schemes which allow one round of quantum
communication and polynomially many rounds of classical communication, yielding
a generalization of blind quantum computation. We give a complexity theoretic
upper bound, namely ${\sf QCMA/qpoly} \cap {\sf coQCMA/qpoly}$, on the types of
functions that admit such a scheme. This upper bound then lets us show that,
under plausible complexity assumptions, such a protocol is no more useful than
classical schemes for delegating ${\sf NP}$-hard problems to the server.
Lastly, we comment on the implications of these results for the prospect of
verifying a quantum computation through classical interaction with the server.

 <dc:description>  A popular curve shown in introductory maths textbooks, seems like a circle.
But it is actually a different curve. This paper discusses some elementary
approaches to identify the geometric object, including novel technological
means by using GeoGebra. We demonstrate two ways to refute the false

confirm the result by proving it rigorously.
  All of the discussed approaches can be introduced in classrooms at various
levels from middle school to high school.

 <dc:description>  A set $D$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a dominating set if every vertex of
$G$, which is not in $D$, has a neighbor in $D$. A set of vertices $D$ in $G$
is convex (respectively, isometric), if all vertices in all shortest paths
(respectively, all vertices in one of the shortest paths) between any two
vertices in $D$ lie in $D$. The problem of finding a minimum convex dominating
(respectively, isometric dominating) set is considered in this paper from
algorithmic point of view. For the class of weak dominating pair graphs
(i.e.,~the graphs that contain a dominating pair, which is a pair of vertices
$x,y\in V(G)$ such that vertices of any path between $x$ and $y$ form a
dominating set), we present an efficient algorithm that finds a minimum
isometric dominating set of such a graph. On the other hand, we prove that even
if one restricts to weak dominating pair graphs that are also chordal graphs,
the problem of deciding whether there exists a convex dominating set bounded by
a given arbitrary positive integer is NP-complete. By further restricting the
class of graphs to chordal dominating pair graphs (i.e.,~the chordal graphs in
which every connected induced subgraph has a dominating pair) we are able to
find a polynomial time algorithm that determines the minimum size of a convex
dominating set of such a graph.

 <dc:description>  The process of liquidity provision in financial markets can result in
prolonged exposure to illiquid instruments for market makers. In this case,
where a proprietary position is not desired, pro-actively targeting the right
client who is likely to be interested can be an effective means to offset this
position, rather than relying on commensurate interest arising through natural
demand. In this paper, we consider the inference of a client profile for the
purpose of corporate bond recommendation, based on typical recorded information
available to the market maker. Given a historical record of corporate bond
transactions and bond meta-data, we use a topic-modelling analogy to develop a
probabilistic technique for compiling a curated list of client recommendations
for a particular bond that needs to be traded, ranked by probability of
interest. We show that a model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation offers
promising performance to deliver relevant recommendations for sales traders.

 <dc:description>  Chat messages of development teams play an increasingly significant role in
software development, having replaced emails in some cases. Chat messages
contain information about discussed issues, considered alternatives and
argumentation leading to the decisions made during software development. These
elements, defined as rationale, are invaluable during software evolution for
documenting and reusing development knowledge. Rationale is also essential for
coping with changes and for effective maintenance of the software system.
However, exploiting the rationale hidden in the chat messages is challenging
due to the high volume of unstructured messages covering a wide range of
topics. This work presents the results of an exploratory study examining the
frequency of rationale in chat messages, the completeness of the available
rationale and the potential of automatic techniques for rationale extraction.
For this purpose, we apply content analysis and machine learning techniques on
more than 8,700 chat messages from three software development projects. Our
results show that chat messages are a rich source of rationale and that machine
learning is a promising technique for detecting rationale and identifying
different rationale elements.

 <dc:description>  This paper aims to address two issues existing in the current speech
enhancement methods: 1) the difficulty of phase estimations; 2) a single
objective function cannot consider multiple metrics simultaneously. To solve
the first problem, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model
for complex spectrogram enhancement, namely estimating clean real and imaginary
(RI) spectrograms from noisy ones. The reconstructed RI spectrograms are
directly used to synthesize enhanced speech waveforms. In addition, since
log-power spectrogram (LPS) can be represented as a function of RI
spectrograms, its reconstruction is also considered as another target. Thus a
unified objective function, which combines these two targets (reconstruction of
RI spectrograms and LPS), is equivalent to simultaneously optimizing two
commonly used objective metrics: segmental signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) and
logspectral distortion (LSD). Therefore, the learning process is called
multi-metrics learning (MML). Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
the proposed CNN with RI spectrograms and MML in terms of improved standardized
evaluation metrics on a speech enhancement task.

 <dc:description>  Despite the recent success of deep-learning based semantic segmentation,
deploying a pre-trained road scene segmenter to a city whose images are not
presented in the training set would not achieve satisfactory performance due to
dataset biases. Instead of collecting a large number of annotated images of
each city of interest to train or refine the segmenter, we propose an
unsupervised learning approach to adapt road scene segmenters across different
cities. By utilizing Google Street View and its time-machine feature, we can
collect unannotated images for each road scene at different times, so that the
associated static-object priors can be extracted accordingly. By advancing a
joint global and class-specific domain adversarial learning framework,
adaptation of pre-trained segmenters to that city can be achieved without the
need of any user annotation or interaction. We show that our method improves
the performance of semantic segmentation in multiple cities across continents,
while it performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches requiring
annotated training data.

 <dc:description>  Energy efficiency is one of the most important parameters for designing and
building a computing system nowadays. Introduction of new transistor and memory
technologies to the integrated circuits design have brought hope for low energy
very large scale integration (VLSI) circuit design. This excellency is pleasant
if the computing system is secure and the energy is not wasted through
execution of malicious actions. In fact, it is required to make sure that the
utilized transistor and memory devices function correctly and no error occurs
in the system operation. In this regard, we propose a built-in-self-test
architecture for security checking of the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) device
under malicious process variations attack. Also, a general identification
technique is presented to investigate the behaviour and activities of the
employed circuitries within this MTJ testing architecture. The presented
identification technique tries to find any abnormal behaviour using the circuit
current signal.

 <dc:title>The Primal-Dual Greedy Algorithm for Weighted Covering Problems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a general approximation framework for weighted integer covering
problems. In a weighted integer covering problem, the goal is to determine a
non-negative integer solution $x$ to system $\{ Ax \geq r \}$ minimizing a
non-negative cost function $c^T x$ (of appropriate dimensions). All
coefficients in matrix $A$ are assumed to be non-negative. We analyze the
performance of a very simple primal-dual greedy algorithm and discuss
conditions of system $(A,r)$ that guarantee feasibility of the constructed
solutions, and a bounded approximation factor. We call system $(A,r)$ a
\emph{greedy system} if it satisfies certain properties introduced in this
work. These properties highly rely on monotonicity and supermodularity
conditions on $A$ and $r$, and can thus be seen as a far reaching
generalization of contra-polymatroids. Given a greedy system $(A,r)$, we
carefully construct a truncated system $(A',r)$ containing the same integer
feasible points. We show that our primal-dual greedy algorithm when applied to
the truncated system $(A',r)$ obtains a feasible solution to $(A,r)$ with
approximation factor at most $2\delta + 1$, or $2\delta$ if $r$ is
non-negative. Here, $\delta$ is some characteristic of the truncated matrix
$A'$ which is small in many applications. The analysis is shown to be tight up
to constant factors. We also provide an approximation factor of $k (\delta +
1)$ if the greedy algorithm is applied to the intersection of multiple greedy
systems. The parameter $k$ is always bounded by the number of greedy systems
but may be much smaller. Again, we show that the dependency on $k$ is tight. We
conclude this paper with an exposition of classical approximation results based
on primal-dual algorithms that are covered by our framework. We match all of
the known results. Additionally, we provide some new insight in a
generalization of the flow cover on a line problem.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper provides modified Distributed Arithmetic based technique to
compute sum of products saving appreciable number of Multiply And accumulation
blocks and this consecutively reduces circuit size. In this technique
multiplexer based structure is used to reuse the blocks so as to reduce the
required memory locations. In this technique a Carry Look Ahead based adder
tree is used to have better area-delay product. Designing of FIR filter is done
using VHDL and synthesized using Xilinx 12.2 synthesis tool and ISIM simulator.
The power analysis is done using Xilinx Xpower analyzer. The proposed structure
requires nearly 42% less cells, 40% less LUT flip-flop pairs used, and also 2%
less power compared with existing structure.

 <dc:title>A polynomial-time randomized reduction from tournament isomorphism to

 <dc:description>  The paper develops a new technique to extract a characteristic subset from a
random source that repeatedly samples from a set of elements. Here a
characteristic subset is a set that when containing an element contains all
elements that have the same probability. With this technique at hand the paper
looks at the special case of the tournament isomorphism problem that stands in
the way towards a polynomial-time algorithm for the graph isomorphism problem.
Noting that there is a reduction from the automorphism (asymmetry) problem to
the isomorphism problem, a reduction in the other direction is nevertheless not
known and remains a thorny open problem. Applying the new technique, we develop
a randomized polynomial-time Turing-reduction from the tournament isomorphism
problem to the tournament automorphism problem. This is the first such
reduction for any kind of combinatorial object not known to have a
polynomial-time solvable isomorphism problem.

 <dc:description>  Riemannian geometry has been successfully used in many brain-computer
interface (BCI) classification problems and demonstrated superior performance.
In this paper, for the first time, it is applied to BCI regression problems, an
important category of BCI applications. More specifically, we propose a new
feature extraction approach for Electroencephalogram (EEG) based BCI regression
problems: a spatial filter is first used to increase the signal quality of the
EEG trials and also to reduce the dimensionality of the covariance matrices,
and then Riemannian tangent space features are extracted. We validate the
performance of the proposed approach in reaction time estimation from EEG
signals measured in a large-scale sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance
task, and show that compared with the traditional powerband features, the
tangent space features can reduce the root mean square estimation error by
4.30-8.30%, and increase the estimation correlation coefficient by 6.59-11.13%.

 <dc:title>TFDASH: A Fairness, Stability, and Efficiency Aware Rate Control

 <dc:description>  Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) has recently been widely deployed
in the Internet and adopted in the industry. It, however, does not impose any
adaptation logic for selecting the quality of video fragments requested by
clients and suffers from lackluster performance with respect to a number of
desirable properties: efficiency, stability, and fairness when multiple players
compete for a bottleneck link. In this paper, we propose a throughput-friendly
DASH (TFDASH) rate control scheme for video streaming with multiple clients
over DASH to well balance the trade-offs among efficiency, stability, and
fairness. The core idea behind guaranteeing fairness and high efficiency
(bandwidth utilization) is to avoid OFF periods during the downloading process
for all clients, i.e., the bandwidth is in perfect-subscription or
over-subscription with bandwidth utilization approach to 100\%. We also propose
a dual-threshold buffer model to solve the instability problem caused by the
above idea. As a result, by integrating these novel components, we also propose
a probability-driven rate adaption logic taking into account several key
factors that most influence visual quality, including buffer occupancy, video
playback quality, video bit-rate switching frequency and amplitude, to
guarantee high-quality video streaming. Our experiments evidently demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed method.

 <dc:title>The Parameterized Complexity of Positional Games</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the parameterized complexity of several positional games. Our main
result is that Short Generalized Hex is W[1]-complete parameterized by the
number of moves. This solves an open problem from Downey and Fellows'
influential list of open problems from 1999. Previously, the problem was
thought of as a natural candidate for AW[*]-completeness. Our main tool is a
new fragment of first-order logic where universally quantified variables only
occur in inequalities. We show that model-checking on arbitrary relational
structures for a formula in this fragment is W[1]-complete when parameterized
by formula size. We also consider a general framework where a positional game
is represented as a hypergraph and two players alternately pick vertices. In a
Maker-Maker game, the first player to have picked all the vertices of some
hyperedge wins the game. In a Maker-Breaker game, the first player wins if she
picks all the vertices of some hyperedge, and the second player wins otherwise.
In an Enforcer-Avoider game, the first player wins if the second player picks
all the vertices of some hyperedge, and the second player wins otherwise. Short
Maker-Maker is AW[*]-complete, whereas Short Maker-Breaker is W[1]-complete and
Short Enforcer-Avoider co-W[1]-complete parameterized by the number of moves.
This suggests a rough parameterized complexity categorization into positional
games that are complete for the first level of the W-hierarchy when the winning
configurations only depend on which vertices one player has been able to pick,
but AW[*]-completeness when the winning condition depends on which vertices
both players have picked. However, some positional games where the board and
the winning configurations are highly structured are fixed-parameter tractable.
We give another example of such a game, Short k-Connect, which is
fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the number of moves.

 <dc:title>The Web SSO Standard OpenID Connect: In-Depth Formal Security Analysis

 <dc:description>  Web-based single sign-on (SSO) services such as Google Sign-In and Log In
with Paypal are based on the OpenID Connect protocol. This protocol enables
so-called relying parties to delegate user authentication to so-called identity
providers. OpenID Connect is one of the newest and most widely deployed single
sign-on protocols on the web. Despite its importance, it has not received much
attention from security researchers so far, and in particular, has not
undergone any rigorous security analysis.
  In this paper, we carry out the first in-depth security analysis of OpenID
Connect. To this end, we use a comprehensive generic model of the web to
develop a detailed formal model of OpenID Connect. Based on this model, we then
precisely formalize and prove central security properties for OpenID Connect,
including authentication, authorization, and session integrity properties.
  In our modeling of OpenID Connect, we employ security measures in order to
avoid attacks on OpenID Connect that have been discovered previously and new
attack variants that we document for the first time in this paper. Based on
these security measures, we propose security guidelines for implementors of
OpenID Connect. Our formal analysis demonstrates that these guidelines are in
fact effective and sufficient.

 <dc:description>  Many privacy-type properties of security protocols can be modelled using
trace equivalence properties in suitable process algebras. It has been shown
that such properties can be decided for interesting classes of finite processes
(i.e., without replication) by means of symbolic execution and constraint
solving. However, this does not suffice to obtain practical tools. Current
prototypes suffer from a classical combinatorial explosion problem caused by
the exploration of many interleavings in the behaviour of processes.
M\&quot;odersheim et al. have tackled this problem for reachability properties using
partial order reduction techniques. We revisit their work, generalize it and
adapt it for equivalence checking. We obtain an optimisation in the form of a
reduced symbolic semantics that eliminates redundant interleavings on the fly.
The obtained partial order reduction technique has been integrated in a tool
called APTE. We conducted complete benchmarks showing dramatic improvements.

 <dc:description>  A central goal in cancer genomics is to identify the somatic alterations that
underpin tumor initiation and progression. This task is challenging as the
mutational profiles of cancer genomes exhibit vast heterogeneity, with many
alterations observed within each individual, few shared somatically mutated
genes across individuals, and important roles in cancer for both frequently and
infrequently mutated genes. While commonly mutated cancer genes are readily
identifiable, those that are rarely mutated across samples are difficult to
distinguish from the large numbers of other infrequently mutated genes. Here,
we introduce a method that considers per-individual mutational profiles within
the context of protein-protein interaction networks in order to identify small
connected subnetworks of genes that, while not individually frequently mutated,
comprise pathways that are perturbed across (i.e., &quot;cover&quot;) a large fraction of
the individuals. We devise a simple yet intuitive objective function that
balances identifying a small subset of genes with covering a large fraction of
individuals. We show how to solve this problem optimally using integer linear
programming and also give a fast heuristic algorithm that works well in
practice. We perform a large-scale evaluation of our resulting method, nCOP, on
6,038 TCGA tumor samples across 24 different cancer types. We demonstrate that
our approach nCOP is more effective in identifying cancer genes than both
methods that do not utilize any network information as well as state-of-the-art
network-based methods that aggregate mutational information across individuals.
Overall, our work demonstrates the power of combining per-individual mutational
information with interaction networks in order to uncover genes functionally
relevant in cancers, and in particular those genes that are less frequently
mutated.

difficulty of reducing a large portion of computation for pixel-wise label
inference. We propose an compressed-PSPNet-based image cascade network (ICNet)
that incorporates multi-resolution branches under proper label guidance to
address this challenge. We provide in-depth analysis of our framework and
introduce the cascade feature fusion to quickly achieve high-quality
segmentation. Our system yields realtime inference on a single GPU card with
decent quality results evaluated on challenging Cityscapes dataset.

 <dc:description>  Re-Pair is an efficient grammar compressor that operates by recursively
replacing high-frequency character pairs with new grammar symbols. The most
space-efficient linear-time algorithm computing Re-Pair uses
$(1+\epsilon)n+\sqrt n$ words on top of the re-writable text (of length $n$ and
stored in $n$ words), for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$; in practice however, this
solution uses complex sub-procedures preventing it from being practical. In
this paper, we present an implementation of the above-mentioned result making
use of more practical solutions; our tool further improves the working space to
$(1.5+\epsilon)n$ words (text included), for some small constant $\epsilon$. As
a second contribution, we focus on compact representations of the output
grammar. The lower bound for storing a grammar with $d$ rules is
$\log(d!)+2d\approx d\log d+0.557 d$ bits, and the most efficient encoding
algorithm in the literature uses at most $d\log d + 2d$ bits and runs in
$\mathcal O(d^{1.5})$ time. We describe a linear-time heuristic maximizing the
compressibility of the output Re-Pair grammar. On real datasets, our grammar
encoding uses---on average---only $2.8\%$ more bits than the
information-theoretic minimum. In half of the tested cases, our compressor
improves the output size of 7-Zip with maximum compression rate turned on.

 <dc:description>  Channel estimation is useful in millimeter wave (mmWave) MIMO communication
systems. Channel state information allows optimized designs of precoders and
combiners under different metrics such as mutual information or
signal-to-interference-noise (SINR) ratio. At mmWave, MIMO precoders and
combiners are usually hybrid, since this architecture provides a means to
trade-off power consumption and achievable rate. Channel estimation is
challenging when using these architectures, however, since there is no direct
access to the outputs of the different antenna elements in the array. The MIMO
channel can only be observed through the analog combining network, which acts
as a compression stage of the received signal. Most of prior work on channel
estimation for hybrid architectures assumes a frequency-flat mmWave channel
model. In this paper, we consider a frequency-selective mmWave channel and
propose compressed-sensing-based strategies to estimate the channel in the
frequency domain. We evaluate different algorithms and compute their complexity
to expose trade-offs in complexity-overhead-performance as compared to those of
previous approaches.

 <dc:description>  The widespread use of multisensor technology and the emergence of big
datasets have created the need to develop tools to reduce, approximate, and
classify large and multimodal data such as higher-order tensors. While early
approaches focused on matrix and vector based methods to represent these
higher-order data, more recently it has been shown that tensor decomposition
methods are better equipped to capture couplings across their different modes.
For these reasons, tensor decomposition methods have found applications in many
different signal processing problems including dimensionality reduction, signal
separation, linear regression, feature extraction, and classification. However,
most of the existing tensor decomposition methods are based on the principle of
finding a low-rank approximation in a linear subspace structure, where the
definition of the rank may change depending on the particular decomposition.
Since many datasets are not necessarily low-rank in a linear subspace, this
often results in high approximation errors or low compression rates. In this
paper, we introduce a new adaptive, multi-scale tensor decomposition method for
higher order data inspired by hybrid linear modeling and subspace clustering
techniques. In particular, we develop a multi-scale higher-order singular value
decomposition (MS-HoSVD) approach where a given tensor is first permuted and
then partitioned into several sub-tensors each of which can be represented as a
low-rank tensor with increased representational efficiency. The proposed
approach is evaluated for dimensionality reduction and classification for
several different real-life tensor signals with promising results.

 <dc:creator>Bramas, Berenger</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Mathematical Software</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes fast sorting techniques using the recent AVX-512
instruction set. Our implementations benefit from the latest possibilities
offered by AVX-512 to vectorize a two-parts hybrid algorithm: we sort the small
arrays using a branch- free Bitonic variant, and we provide a vectorized
partitioning kernel which is the main component of the well-known Quicksort.
Our algorithm sorts in-place and is straightforward to implement thanks to the
new instructions. Meanwhile, we also show how an algorithm can be adapted and
implemented with AVX-512. We report a performance study on the Intel KNL where
our approach is faster than the GNU C++ sort algorithm for any size in both
integer and double floating-point arithmetics by a factor of 4 in average.

 <dc:description>  The notion of events has occupied a central role in modeling and has an
influence in computer science and philosophy. Recent developments in
diagrammatic modeling have made it possible to examine conceptual
representation of events. This paper explores some aspects of the notion of
events that are produced by applying a new diagrammatic methodology with a
focus on the interaction of events with such concepts as time and space,
objects. The proposed description applies to abstract machines where events
form the dynamic phases of a system. The results of this nontechnical research
can be utilized in many fields where the notion of an event is typically used
in interdisciplinary application.

 <dc:description>  Finding central nodes is a fundamental problem in network analysis.
Betweenness centrality is a well-known measure which quantifies the importance
of a node based on the fraction of shortest paths going though it. Due to the
dynamic nature of many today's networks, algorithms that quickly update
centrality scores have become a necessity. For betweenness, several dynamic
algorithms have been proposed over the years, targeting different update types
(incremental- and decremental-only, fully-dynamic). In this paper we introduce
a new dynamic algorithm for updating betweenness centrality after an edge
insertion or an edge weight decrease. Our method is a combination of two
independent contributions: a faster algorithm for updating pairwise distances
as well as number of shortest paths, and a faster algorithm for updating
dependencies. Whereas the worst-case running time of our algorithm is the same
as recomputation, our techniques considerably reduce the number of operations
performed by existing dynamic betweenness algorithms.

 <dc:title>Crowdsensing in Opportunistic Mobile Social Networks: A Context-aware
  and Human-centric Approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nguyen, Phuong</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Nahrstedt, Klara</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years, there have been efforts to collect human contact traces
during social events (e.g., conferences) using Bluetooth devices (e.g., mobile
phones, iMotes). The results of these studies have enabled the ability to do
the crowd-sourcing task from within the crowd, in order to answer questions,
such as: what is the current density of the crowd, or how many people are
attending the event? However, in those studies, the sensing devices are usually
distributed and configured in a certain manner. For example, the number of
devices is fixed, people register for the devices on a volunteering basis. In
this paper, we treat the above problem as an optimization problem and draw the
connection to the vertex cover problem in graph theory. Since finding the
optimal solution for minimum vertex cover problem is NP-complete, approximation
algorithms have to be used. However, we will show that the well-known
approximation algorithms do not perform well with the crowd-sensing task. In
this paper, we propose the notions of node observability and coverage utility
score and design a new context-aware approximation algorithm to find vertex
cover that is tailored for crowd-sensing task. In addition, we design
human-centric bootstrapping strategies to make initial assignment of sensing
devices based on meta information about the participants (e.g., interests,
friendship). The motivation is to assign the sensing task to a more
&quot;socialized&quot; device to obtain better sensing coverage. We perform comprehensive
experiments on real-world data traces obtained from previous experimental
studies in conference and academic social context. The results show that our
proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline approximation
algorithms in terms of sensing coverage.

 <dc:description>  In order to handle undesirable failures of a multicopter which occur in
either the pre-flight process or the in-flight process, a failsafe mechanism
design method based on supervisory control theory is proposed for the
semi-autonomous control mode. Failsafe mechanism is a control logic that guides
what subsequent actions the multicopter should take, by taking account of
real-time information from guidance, attitude control, diagnosis, and other
low-level subsystems. In order to design a failsafe mechanism for multicopters,
safety issues of multicopters are introduced. Then, user requirements including
functional requirements and safety requirements are textually described, where
function requirements determine a general multicopter plant, and safety
requirements cover the failsafe measures dealing with the presented safety
issues. In order to model the user requirements by discrete-event systems,
several multicopter modes and events are defined. On this basis, the
multicopter plant and control specifications are modeled by automata. Then, a
supervisor is synthesized by monolithic supervisory control theory. In
addition, we present three examples to demonstrate the potential blocking
phenomenon due to inappropriate design of control specifications. Also, we
discuss the meaning of correctness and the properties of the obtained
supervisor. This makes the failsafe mechanism convincingly correct and
effective. Finally, based on the obtained supervisory controller generated by
TCT software, an implementation method suitable for multicopters is presented,
in which the supervisory controller is transformed into decision-making codes.

 <dc:description>  Computer vision systems are designed to work well within the context of
everyday photography. However, artists often render the world around them in
ways that do not resemble photographs. Artwork produced by people is not
constrained to mimic the physical world, making it more challenging for
machines to recognize.
  This work is a step toward teaching machines how to categorize images in ways
that are valuable to humans. First, we collect a large-scale dataset of
contemporary artwork from Behance, a website containing millions of portfolios
from professional and commercial artists. We annotate Behance imagery with rich
attribute labels for content, emotions, and artistic media. Furthermore, we
carry out baseline experiments to show the value of this dataset for artistic
style prediction, for improving the generality of existing object classifiers,
and for the study of visual domain adaptation. We believe our Behance Artistic
Media dataset will be a good starting point for researchers wishing to study
artistic imagery and relevant problems.

 <dc:description>  The field of fixation prediction is heavily model-driven, with dozens of new
models published every year. However, progress in the field can be difficult to
judge because models are compared using a variety of inconsistent metrics. As
soon as a saliency map is optimized for a certain metric, it is penalized by
other metrics. Here we propose a principled approach to solve the benchmarking
problem: we separate the notions of saliency models and saliency maps. We
define a saliency model to be a probabilistic model of fixation density
prediction and, inspired by Bayesian decision theory, a saliency map to be a
metric-specific prediction derived from the model density which maximizes the
expected performance on that metric. We derive the optimal saliency map for the
most commonly used saliency metrics (AUC, sAUC, NSS, CC, SIM, KL-Div) and show
that they can be computed analytically or approximated with high precision
using the model density. We show that this leads to consistent rankings in all
metrics and avoids the penalties of using one saliency map for all metrics.
Under this framework, &quot;good&quot; models will perform well in all metrics.

indicate that it will trigger the fourth industrial revolution. This article
presents a review of some of the most relevant milestones that occurred in
robotics over the last few decades and future perspectives. Despite the fact
that, nowadays, robotics is an emerging field, the challenges in many
technological aspects and more importantly bringing innovative solutions to the
market still remain open. The need of reducing the integration time, costs and
a common hardware infrastructure are discussed and further analysed in this
work. We conclude with a discussion of the future perspectives of robotics as

 <dc:description>  Automatic affect recognition is a challenging task due to the various
modalities emotions can be expressed with. Applications can be found in many
domains including multimedia retrieval and human computer interaction. In
recent years, deep neural networks have been used with great success in
determining emotional states. Inspired by this success, we propose an emotion
recognition system using auditory and visual modalities. To capture the
emotional content for various styles of speaking, robust features need to be
extracted. To this purpose, we utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
extract features from the speech, while for the visual modality a deep residual
network (ResNet) of 50 layers. In addition to the importance of feature
extraction, a machine learning algorithm needs also to be insensitive to
outliers while being able to model the context. To tackle this problem, Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are utilized. The system is then trained in
an end-to-end fashion where - by also taking advantage of the correlations of
the each of the streams - we manage to significantly outperform the traditional
approaches based on auditory and visual handcrafted features for the prediction
of spontaneous and natural emotions on the RECOLA database of the AVEC 2016
research challenge on emotion recognition.

{\cal S}$ so that $S\subseteq W$. The members in $U$ are called {\em vertices}
and the sets of ${\cal S}$ are called the {\em hyperedges}. This is the
simplest extension into hyperedges of the case of sets of size $2$ which is the
well known Dense $k$-subgraph problem.
  The best known ratio for the Dense-$3$-Subhypergraph is $O(n^{0.69783..})$ by
Chlamt{\'{a}}c et al. We improve this ratio to $n^{0.61802..}$. More
importantly, we give a new algorithm that approximates Dense-$3$-Subhypergraph
within a ratio of $\tilde O(n/k)$, which improves the ratio of $O(n^2/k^2)$ of
Chlamt{\'{a}}c et al.
  We prove that under the {\em log density conjecture} (see Bhaskara et al.
[STOC'10]) the ratio cannot be better than $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ and demonstrate
some cases in which this optimum can be attained.

 <dc:description>Comment: Claim 4.6 does not hold for the algorithm; we erroneously claimed
  that we could nullify kD'_i edges in the ith step of the algorithm</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  We state and solve a problem of the optimal geographic caching of content in
cellular networks, where linear combinations of contents are stored in the
caches of base stations. We consider a general content popularity distribution
and a general distribution of the number of stations covering the typical
location in the network. We are looking for a policy of content caching
maximizing the probability of serving the typical content request from the
caches of covering stations. The problem has a special form of monotone
sub-modular set function maximization. Using dynamic programming, we find a
deterministic policy solving the problem. We also consider two natural greedy
caching policies. We evaluate our policies considering two popular stochastic
geometric coverage models: the Boolean one and the
Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise-Ratio one, assuming Zipf popularity
distribution. Our numerical results show that the proposed deterministic
policies are in general not worse than some randomized policy considered in the
literature and can further improve the total hit probability in the moderately
high coverage regime.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In error-correcting codes, locality refers to several different ways of
quantifying how easily a small amount of information can be recovered from
encoded data. In this work, we study a notion of locality called the
s-Disjoint-Repair-Group Property (s-DRGP). This notion can interpolate between
two very different settings in coding theory: that of Locally Correctable Codes
(LCCs) when s is large---a very strong guarantee---and Locally Recoverable
Codes (LRCs) when s is small---a relatively weaker guarantee. This motivates
the study of the s-DRGP for intermediate s, which is the focus of our paper. We
construct codes in this parameter regime which have a higher rate than
previously known codes. Our construction is based on a novel variant of the
lifted codes of Guo, Kopparty and Sudan. Beyond the results on the s-DRGP, we
hope that our construction is of independent interest, and will find uses
elsewhere.

 <dc:description>  Text line detection and localization is a crucial step for full page document
analysis, but still suffers from heterogeneity of real life documents. In this
paper, we present a new approach for full page text recognition. Localization
of the text lines is based on regressions with Fully Convolutional Neural
Networks and Multidimensional Long Short-Term Memory as contextual layers. In
order to increase the efficiency of this localization method, only the position
of the left side of the text lines are predicted. The text recognizer is then
in charge of predicting the end of the text to recognize. This method has shown
good results for full page text recognition on the highly heterogeneous Maurdor
dataset.

 <dc:title>Sparse Hierachical Extrapolated Parametric Methods for Cortical Data

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many neuroimaging studies focus on the cortex, in order to benefit from
better signal to noise ratios and reduced computational burden. Cortical data
are usually projected onto a reference mesh, where subsequent analyses are
carried out. Several multiscale approaches have been proposed for analyzing
these surface data, such as spherical harmonics and graph wavelets. As far as
we know, however, the hierarchical structure of the template icosahedral meshes
used by most neuroimaging software has never been exploited for cortical data
factorization. In this paper, we demonstrate how the structure of the
ubiquitous icosahedral meshes can be exploited by data factorization methods
such as sparse dictionary learning, and we assess the optimization speed-up
offered by extrapolation methods in this context. By testing different
sparsity-inducing norms, extrapolation methods, and factorization schemes, we
compare the performances of eleven methods for analyzing four datasets: two
structural and two functional MRI datasets obtained by processing the data
publicly available for the hundred unrelated subjects of the Human Connectome
Project. Our results demonstrate that, depending on the level of details
requested, a speedup of several orders of magnitudes can be obtained.

 <dc:description>  Generalizing standard monadic second-order logic for Kripke models, we
introduce monadic second-order logic interpreted over coalgebras for an
arbitrary set functor. We then consider invariance under behavioral equivalence
of MSO-formulas. More specifically, we investigate whether the coalgebraic
mu-calculus is the bisimulation-invariant fragment of the monadic second-order
language for a given functor. Using automatatheoretic techniques and building
on recent results by the third author, we show that in order to provide such a
characterization result it suffices to find what we call an adequate uniform
construction for the coalgebraic type functor. As direct applications of this
result we obtain a partly new proof of the Janin-Walukiewicz Theorem for the
modal mu-calculus, avoiding the use of syntactic normal forms, and bisimulation
invariance results for the bag functor (graded modal logic) and all exponential
polynomial functors (including the &quot;game functor&quot;). As a more involved
application, involving additional non-trivial ideas, we also derive a
characterization theorem for the monotone modal mu-calculus, with respect to a
natural monadic second-order language for monotone neighborhood models.

 <dc:description>  The 2-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) can be found in the heart of many
image-processing algorithms. Until recently, several studies have compared the
performance of such transform on various shared-memory parallel architectures,
especially on graphics processing units (GPUs). All these studies, however,
considered only separable calculation schemes. We show that corresponding
separable parts can be merged into non-separable units, which halves the number
of steps. In addition, we introduce an optional optimization approach leading
to a reduction in the number of arithmetic operations. The discussed schemes
were adapted on the OpenCL framework and pixel shaders, and then evaluated
using GPUs of two biggest vendors. We demonstrate the performance of the
proposed non-separable methods by comparison with existing separable schemes.
The non-separable schemes outperform their separable counterparts on numerous
setups, especially considering the pixel shaders.

 <dc:title>The ZX calculus is a language for surface code lattice surgery</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Quantum computing is moving rapidly to the point of deployment of technology.
Functional quantum devices will require the ability to correct error in order
to be scalable and effective. A leading choice of error correction, in
particular for modular or distributed architectures, is the surface code with
logical two-qubit operations realised via &quot;lattice surgery&quot;. These operations
consist of &quot;merges&quot; and &quot;splits&quot; acting non-unitarily on the logical states and
are not easily captured by standard circuit notation. This raises the question
of how best to reason about lattice surgery in order efficiently to use quantum
states and operations in architectures with complex resource management issues.
In this paper we demonstrate that the operations of the ZX calculus, a form of
quantum diagrammatic reasoning designed using category theory, match exactly
the operations of lattice surgery. Red and green &quot;spider&quot; nodes match rough and
smooth merges and splits, and follow the axioms of a dagger special associative
Frobenius algebra. Some lattice surgery operations can require non-trivial
correction operations, which are captured natively in the use of the ZX
calculus in the form of ensembles of diagrams. We give a first taste of the
power of the calculus as a language for surgery by considering two operations
(magic state use and producing a CNOT) and show how ZX diagram re-write rules
give lattice surgery procedures for these operations that are novel, efficient,
and highly configurable.

 <dc:description>  One of the most challenging tasks when adopting Bayesian Networks (BNs) is
the one of learning their structure from data. This task is complicated by the
huge search space of possible solutions and turned out to be a well-known
NP-hard problem and, hence, approximations are required. However, to the best
of our knowledge, a quantitative analysis of the performance and
characteristics of the different heuristics to solve this problem has never
been done before.
  For this reason, in this work, we provide a detailed study of the different
state-of-the-arts methods for structural learning on simulated data considering
both BNs with discrete and continuous variables, and with different rates of
noise in the data. In particular, we investigate the characteristics of
different widespread scores proposed for the inference and the statistical
pitfalls within them.

 <dc:title>Non-Uniform Attacks Against Pseudoentropy</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  De, Trevisan and Tulsiani [CRYPTO 2010] show that every distribution over
$n$-bit strings which has constant statistical distance to uniform (e.g., the
output of a pseudorandom generator mapping $n-1$ to $n$ bit strings), can be
distinguished from the uniform distribution with advantage $\epsilon$ by a
circuit of size $O( 2^n\epsilon^2)$.
  We generalize this result, showing that a distribution which has less than
$k$ bits of min-entropy, can be distinguished from any distribution with $k$
bits of $\delta$-smooth min-entropy with advantage $\epsilon$ by a circuit of
size $O(2^k\epsilon^2/\delta^2)$. As a special case, this implies that any
distribution with support at most $2^k$ (e.g., the output of a pseudoentropy
generator mapping $k$ to $n$ bit strings) can be distinguished from any given
distribution with min-entropy $k+1$ with advantage $\epsilon$ by a circuit of
size $O(2^k\epsilon^2)$.
  Our result thus shows that pseudoentropy distributions face basically the
same non-uniform attacks as pseudorandom distributions.

 <dc:description>  We consider an energy harvesting two-hop network where a source is
communicating to a destination through a relay. During a given communication
session time, the source collects measurement updates from a physical
phenomenon and sends them to the relay, which then forwards them to the
destination. The objective is to send these updates to the destination as
timely as possible; namely, such that the total age of information is minimized
by the end of the communication session, subject to energy causality
constraints at the source and the relay, and data causality constraints at the
relay. Both the source and the relay use fixed, yet possibly different,
transmission rates. Hence, each update packet incurs fixed non-zero
transmission delays. We first solve the single-hop version of this problem, and
then show that the two-hop problem is solved by treating the source and relay
nodes as one combined node, with some parameter transformations, and solving a
single-hop problem between that combined node and the destination.

 <dc:description>  This work studies the strong duality of non-convex matrix factorization
problems: we show that under certain dual conditions, these problems and its
dual have the same optimum. This has been well understood for convex
optimization, but little was known for non-convex problems. We propose a novel
analytical framework and show that under certain dual conditions, the optimal
solution of the matrix factorization program is the same as its bi-dual and
thus the global optimality of the non-convex program can be achieved by solving
its bi-dual which is convex. These dual conditions are satisfied by a wide
class of matrix factorization problems, although matrix factorization problems
are hard to solve in full generality. This analytical framework may be of
independent interest to non-convex optimization more broadly.
  We apply our framework to two prototypical matrix factorization problems:
matrix completion and robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA). These are
examples of efficiently recovering a hidden matrix given limited reliable
observations of it. Our framework shows that exact recoverability and strong
duality hold with nearly-optimal sample complexity guarantees for matrix
completion and robust PCA.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new framework for learning dense correspondence between
deformable 3D shapes. Existing learning based approaches model shape
correspondence as a labelling problem, where each point of a query shape
receives a label identifying a point on some reference domain; the
correspondence is then constructed a posteriori by composing the label
predictions of two input shapes. We propose a paradigm shift and design a
structured prediction model in the space of functional maps, linear operators
that provide a compact representation of the correspondence. We model the
learning process via a deep residual network which takes dense descriptor
fields defined on two shapes as input, and outputs a soft map between the two
given objects. The resulting correspondence is shown to be accurate on several
challenging benchmarks comprising multiple categories, synthetic models, real
scans with acquisition artifacts, topological noise, and partiality.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things (IoT) being a promising technology of the future is
expected to connect billions of devices. The increased number of communication
is expected to generate mountains of data and the security of data can be a
threat. The devices in the architecture are essentially smaller in size and low
powered. Conventional encryption algorithms are generally computationally
expensive due to their complexity and requires many rounds to encrypt,
essentially wasting the constrained energy of the gadgets. Less complex
algorithm, however, may compromise the desired integrity. In this paper we
propose a lightweight encryption algorithm named as Secure IoT (SIT). It is a
64-bit block cipher and requires 64-bit key to encrypt the data. The
architecture of the algorithm is a mixture of feistel and a uniform
substitution-permutation network. Simulations result shows the algorithm
provides substantial security in just five encryption rounds. The hardware
implementation of the algorithm is done on a low cost 8-bit micro-controller
and the results of code size, memory utilization and encryption/decryption
execution cycles are compared with benchmark encryption algorithms. The MATLAB
code for relevant simulations is available online at https://goo.gl/Uw7E0W.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present AWEsome (Airborne Wind Energy Standardized
Open-source Model Environment), a test platform for airborne wind energy
systems that consists of low-cost hardware and is entirely based on open-source
software. It can hence be used without the need of large financial investments,
in particular by research groups and startups to acquire first experiences in
their flight operations, to test novel control strategies or technical designs,
or for usage in public relations. Our system consists of a modified
off-the-shelf model aircraft that is controlled by the pixhawk autopilot
hardware and the ardupilot software for fixed wing aircraft. The aircraft is
attached to the ground by a tether. We have implemented new flight modes for
the autonomous tethered flight of the aircraft along periodic patterns. We
present the principal functionality of our algorithms. We report on first
successful tests of these modes in real flights.

 <dc:description>  We present a general framework for balancing expressions (terms) in form of
so called tree straight-line programs. The latter can be seen as circuits over
the free term algebra extended by contexts (terms with a hole) and the
operations which insert terms/contexts into contexts. It is shown that for
every term one can compute in DLOGTIME-uniform TC$^0$ a tree straight-line
program of logarithmic depth and size $O(n/\log n)$. This allows reducing the
term evaluation problem over an arbitrary algebra $\mathcal{A}$ to the term
evaluation problem over a derived two-sorted algebra
$\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{A})$. Several applications are presented: (i) an
alternative proof for a recent result by Krebs, Limaye and Ludwig on the
expression evaluation problem is given, (ii) it is shown that expressions for
an arbitrary (possibly non-commutative) semiring can be transformed in
DLOGTIME-uniform TC$^0$ into equivalent circuits of logarithmic depth and size
$O(n/\log n)$, and (iii) a corresponding result for regular expressions is
shown.

 <dc:title>Finding the Size of a Radio Network with Short Labels</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The number of nodes of a network, called its size, is one of the most
important network parameters. A radio network is a collection of stations,
called nodes, with wireless transmission and receiving capabilities. It is
modeled as a simple connected undirected graph whose nodes communicate in
synchronous rounds. In each round, a node can either transmit a message to all
its neighbors, or stay silent and listen. At the receiving end, a node $v$
hears a message from a neighbor $w$ in a given round, if $v$ listens in this
round, and if $w$ is its only neighbor that transmits in this round. If $v$
listens in a round, and two or more neighbors of $v$ transmit in this round, a
collision occurs at $v$. Two scenarios are considered in the literature: if
nodes can distinguish collision from silence (the latter occurs when no
neighbor transmits), we say that the network has the collision detection
capability, otherwise there is no collision detection.
  We consider the task of size discovery: finding the size of an unknown radio
network with collision detection. All nodes have to output the size of the
network, using a deterministic algorithm. Nodes have labels which are (not
necessarily distinct) binary strings. The length of a labeling scheme is the
largest length of a label.
  Our main result states that the minimum length of a labeling scheme
permitting size discovery in the class of networks of maximum degree Delta is
Theta(\log\log Delta).

 <dc:description>  A Siamese Deep Forest (SDF) is proposed in the paper. It is based on the Deep
Forest or gcForest proposed by Zhou and Feng and can be viewed as a gcForest
modification. It can be also regarded as an alternative to the well-known
Siamese neural networks. The SDF uses a modified training set consisting of
concatenated pairs of vectors. Moreover, it defines the class distributions in
the deep forest as the weighted sum of the tree class probabilities such that
the weights are determined in order to reduce distances between similar pairs
and to increase them between dissimilar points. We show that the weights can be
obtained by solving a quadratic optimization problem. The SDF aims to prevent
overfitting which takes place in neural networks when only limited training
data are available. The numerical experiments illustrate the proposed distance
metric method.

 <dc:description>  Artificial intelligence methods have often been applied to perform specific
functions or tasks in the cyber-defense realm. However, as adversary methods
become more complex and difficult to divine, piecemeal efforts to understand
cyber-attacks, and malware-based attacks in particular, are not providing
sufficient means for malware analysts to understand the past, present and
future characteristics of malware.
  In this paper, we present the Malware Analysis and Attributed using Genetic
Information (MAAGI) system. The underlying idea behind the MAAGI system is that
there are strong similarities between malware behavior and biological organism
behavior, and applying biologically inspired methods to corpora of malware can
help analysts better understand the ecosystem of malware attacks. Due to the
sophistication of the malware and the analysis, the MAAGI system relies heavily
on artificial intelligence techniques to provide this capability. It has
already yielded promising results over its development life, and will hopefully
inspire more integration between the artificial intelligence and cyber--defense
communities.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new class of random sequences called binary primes
tableau (PT) sequences that have potential applications in cryptography and
communications. The PT sequence of rank p is obtained from numbers arranged in
a tableau with p columns where primes are marked off until each column has at
least one prime and where the column entries are added modulo 2. We also
examine the dual to the PT sequences obtained by adding the rows of the
tableau. It is shown that PT sequences have excellent autocorrelation
properties.

 <dc:description>  Despite the rapid progress, existing works on action understanding focus
strictly on one type of action agent, which we call actor---a human adult,
ignoring the diversity of actions performed by other actors. To overcome this
narrow viewpoint, our paper marks the first effort in the computer vision
community to jointly consider algorithmic understanding of various types of
actors undergoing various actions. To begin with, we collect a large annotated
Actor-Action Dataset (A2D) that consists of 3782 short videos and 31 temporally
untrimmed long videos. We formulate the general actor-action understanding
problem and instantiate it at various granularities: video-level single- and
multiple-label actor-action recognition, and pixel-level actor-action
segmentation. We propose and examine a comprehensive set of graphical models
that consider the various types of interplay among actors and actions. Our
findings have led us to conclusive evidence that the joint modeling of actor
and action improves performance over modeling each of them independently, and
further improvement can be obtained by considering the multi-scale natural in
video understanding. Hence, our paper concludes the argument of the value of
explicit consideration of various actors in comprehensive action understanding
and provides a dataset and a benchmark for later works exploring this new
problem.

 <dc:description>  Many methods for automatic music transcription involves a multi-pitch
estimation method that estimates an activity score for each pitch. A second
processing step, called note segmentation, has to be performed for each pitch
in order to identify the time intervals when the notes are played. In this
study, a pitch-wise two-state on/off firstorder Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is
developed for note segmentation. A complete parametrization of the HMM sigmoid
function is proposed, based on its original regression formulation, including a
parameter alpha of slope smoothing and beta? of thresholding contrast. A
comparative evaluation of different note segmentation strategies was performed,
differentiated according to whether they use a fixed threshold, called &quot;Hard
Thresholding&quot; (HT), or a HMM-based thresholding method, called &quot;Soft
Thresholding&quot; (ST). This evaluation was done following MIREX standards and
using the MAPS dataset. Also, different transcription scenarios and recording
natures were tested using three units of the Degradation toolbox. Results show
that note segmentation through a HMM soft thresholding with a data-based
optimization of the {alpha,beta} parameter couple significantly enhances
transcription performance.

Speak (available at rocspeak.com) enables anyone to go to a website, record a

modulation, filler word usage, unique word usage, word cloud of the spoken
words, in addition to overall assessment and subjective comments by peers. Peer
comments are automatically ranked and sorted for usefulness and sentiment
(i.e., positive vs. negative). We evaluated the system with a diverse group of
56 online participants for a 10-day period. Participants submitted responses to
career oriented prompts every other day. The participants were randomly split
into two groups: 1) treatment - full feedback from the ROC Speak system; 2)
control - written feedback from online peers. When judged by peers (p&lt;.001) and
independent raters (p&lt;.05), participants from the treatment group demonstrated
statistically significant improvement in overall speaking skills rating while
the control group did not. Furthermore, in terms of speaking attributes,
treatment group showed an improvement in friendliness (p&lt;.001), vocal variety
(p&lt;.05) and articulation (p&lt;.01).

 <dc:description>  Cloud providers have begun to offer their surplus capacity in the form of
low-cost transient servers, which can be revoked unilaterally at any time.
While the low cost of transient servers makes them attractive for a wide range
of applications, such as data processing and scientific computing, failures due
to server revocation can severely degrade application performance. Since
different transient server types offer different cost and availability
tradeoffs, we present the notion of server portfolios that is based on
financial portfolio modeling. Server portfolios enable construction of an
&quot;optimal&quot; mix of severs to meet an application's sensitivity to cost and
revocation risk. We implement model-driven portfolios in a system called
ExoSphere, and show how diverse applications can use portfolios and
application-specific policies to gracefully handle transient servers. We show
that ExoSphere enables widely-used parallel applications such as Spark, MPI,
and BOINC to be made transiency-aware with modest effort. Our experiments show
that allowing the applications to use suitable transiency-aware policies,
ExoSphere is able to achieve 80\% cost savings when compared to on-demand
servers and greatly reduces revocation risk compared to existing approaches.

 <dc:title>Improving Facial Attribute Prediction using Semantic Segmentation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kalayeh, Mahdi M.</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Attributes are semantically meaningful characteristics whose applicability
widely crosses category boundaries. They are particularly important in
describing and recognizing concepts where no explicit training example is
given, \textit{e.g., zero-shot learning}. Additionally, since attributes are
human describable, they can be used for efficient human-computer interaction.
In this paper, we propose to employ semantic segmentation to improve facial
attribute prediction. The core idea lies in the fact that many facial
attributes describe local properties. In other words, the probability of an
attribute to appear in a face image is far from being uniform in the spatial
domain. We build our facial attribute prediction model jointly with a deep
semantic segmentation network. This harnesses the localization cues learned by
the semantic segmentation to guide the attention of the attribute prediction to
the regions where different attributes naturally show up. As a result of this
approach, in addition to recognition, we are able to localize the attributes,
despite merely having access to image level labels (weak supervision) during
training. We evaluate our proposed method on CelebA and LFWA datasets and
achieve superior results to the prior arts. Furthermore, we show that in the
reverse problem, semantic face parsing improves when facial attributes are
available. That reaffirms the need to jointly model these two interconnected
tasks.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the Busy Beaver Game introduced by Rado (1962) generalized to
non-binary alphabets. Harland (2016) conjectured that activity (number of
steps) and productivity (number of non-blank symbols) of candidate machines
grow as the alphabet size increases. We prove this conjecture for any alphabet
size under the condition that the number of states is sufficiently large. For
the measure activity we show that increasing the alphabet size from two to
three allows an increase. By a classical construction it is even possible to
obtain a two-state machine increasing activity and productivity of any machine
if we allow an alphabet size depending on the number of states of the original
machine. We also show that an increase of the alphabet by a factor of three
admits an increase of activity.

 <dc:description>  Small changes to the parameters of a system can lead to abrupt qualitative
changes of its behavior, a phenomenon known as bifurcation. Such instabilities
are typically considered problematic, however, we show that their power can be
leveraged to design novel types of mechanisms. Hysteresis mechanisms use
transient changes of system parameters to induce a permanent improvement to its
performance via optimal equilibrium selection. Optimal control mechanisms
induce convergence to states whose performance is better than even the best
equilibrium. We apply these mechanisms in two different settings that
illustrate the versatility of bifurcation mechanism design. In the first one we
explore how introducing flat taxation can improve social welfare, despite
decreasing agent &quot;rationality&quot;, by destabilizing inefficient equilibria. From
there we move on to consider a well known game of tumor metabolism and use our
approach to derive novel cancer treatment strategies.

 <dc:description>  In the recent years, we have witnessed the development of multi-label
classification methods which utilize the structure of the label space in a
divide and conquer approach to improve classification performance and allow
large data sets to be classified efficiently. Yet most of the available data
sets have been provided in train/test splits that did not account for
maintaining a distribution of higher-order relationships between labels among
splits or folds. We present a new approach to stratifying multi-label data for
classification purposes based on the iterative stratification approach proposed
by Sechidis et. al. in an ECML PKDD 2011 paper. Our method extends the
iterative approach to take into account second-order relationships between
labels. Obtained results are evaluated using statistical properties of obtained
strata as presented by Sechidis. We also propose new statistical measures
relevant to second-order quality: label pairs distribution, the percentage of
label pairs without positive evidence in folds and label pair - fold pairs that
have no positive evidence for the label pair. We verify the impact of new
methods on classification performance of Binary Relevance, Label Powerset and a
fast greedy community detection based label space partitioning classifier.
Random Forests serve as base classifiers. We check the variation of the number
of communities obtained per fold, and the stability of their modularity score.
Second-Order Iterative Stratification is compared to standard k-fold, label
set, and iterative stratification. The proposed approach lowers the variance of
classification quality, improves label pair oriented measures and example
distribution while maintaining a competitive quality in label-oriented
measures. We also witness an increase in stability of network characteristics.

 <dc:description>  Obstacle avoidance from monocular images is a challenging problem for robots.
Though multi-view structure-from-motion could build 3D maps, it is not robust
in textureless environments. Some learning based methods exploit human
demonstration to predict a steering command directly from a single image.
However, this method is usually biased towards certain tasks or demonstration
scenarios and also biased by human understanding. In this paper, we propose a
new method to predict a trajectory from images. We train our system on more
diverse NYUv2 dataset. The ground truth trajectory is computed from the
designed cost functions automatically. The Convolutional Neural Network
perception is divided into two stages: first, predict depth map and surface
normal from RGB images, which are two important geometric properties related to
3D obstacle representation. Second, predict the trajectory from the depth and
normal. Results show that our intermediate perception increases the accuracy by
20% than the direct prediction. Our model generalizes well to other public
indoor datasets and is also demonstrated for robot flights in simulation and
experiments.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach to rapidly and easily build natural language
interfaces to databases for new domains, whose performance improves over time
based on user feedback, and requires minimal intervention. To achieve this, we
adapt neural sequence models to map utterances directly to SQL with its full
expressivity, bypassing any intermediate meaning representations. These models
are immediately deployed online to solicit feedback from real users to flag
incorrect queries. Finally, the popularity of SQL facilitates gathering
annotations for incorrect predictions using the crowd, which is directly used
to improve our models. This complete feedback loop, without intermediate
representations or database specific engineering, opens up new ways of building
high quality semantic parsers. Experiments suggest that this approach can be
deployed quickly for any new target domain, as we show by learning a semantic
parser for an online academic database from scratch.

 <dc:description>  The paper is concerned with the computational complexity of the initial value
problem (IVP) for a system of ordinary dynamical equations. Formal problem
statement is given, containing a Turing machine with an oracle for getting the
initial values as real numbers. It is proven that the computational complexity
of the IVP for the three body problem is not bounded by a polynomial. The proof
is based on the analysis of oscillatory solutions of the Sitnikov problem that
have complex dynamical behavior. These solutions contradict the existence of an
algorithm that solves the IVP in polynomial time.

 <dc:description>  We present GazeDirector, a new approach for eye gaze redirection that uses
model-fitting. Our method first tracks the eyes by fitting a multi-part eye
region model to video frames using analysis-by-synthesis, thereby recovering
eye region shape, texture, pose, and gaze simultaneously. It then redirects
gaze by 1) warping the eyelids from the original image using a model-derived
flow field, and 2) rendering and compositing synthesized 3D eyeballs onto the
output image in a photorealistic manner. GazeDirector allows us to change where
people are looking without person-specific training data, and with full
articulation, i.e. we can precisely specify new gaze directions in 3D.
Quantitatively, we evaluate both model-fitting and gaze synthesis, with
experiments for gaze estimation and redirection on the Columbia gaze dataset.
Qualitatively, we compare GazeDirector against recent work on gaze redirection,
showing better results especially for large redirection angles. Finally, we
demonstrate gaze redirection on YouTube videos by introducing new 3D gaze
targets and by manipulating visual behavior.

 <dc:description>  In competitive sports it is often very hard to quantify the performance. A
player to score or overtake may depend on only millesimal of seconds or
millimeters. In racquet sports like tennis, table tennis and squash many events
will occur in a short time duration, whose recording and analysis can help
reveal the differences in performance. In this paper we show that it is
possible to architect a framework that utilizes the characteristic sound
patterns to precisely classify the types of and localize the positions of these
events. From these basic information the shot types and the ball speed along
the trajectories can be estimated. Comparing these estimates with the optimal
speed and target the precision of the shot can be defined. The detailed shot
statistics and precision information significantly enriches and improves data
available today. Feeding them back to the players and the coaches facilitates
to describe playing performance objectively and to improve strategy skills. The
framework is implemented, its hardware and software components are installed
and tested in a squash court.

 <dc:description>  The polyhedron projection for 360-degree video is becoming more and more
popular since it can lead to much less geometry distortion compared with the
equirectangular projection. However, in the polyhedron projection, we can
observe very obvious texture discontinuity in the area near the face boundary.
Such a texture discontinuity may lead to serious quality degradation when
motion compensation crosses the discontinuous face boundary. To solve this
problem, in this paper, we first propose to fill the corresponding neighboring
faces in the suitable positions as the extension of the current face to keep
approximated texture continuity. Then a co-projection-plane based 3-D padding
method is proposed to project the reference pixels in the neighboring face to
the current face to guarantee exact texture continuity. Under the proposed
scheme, the reference pixel is always projected to the same plane with the
current pixel when performing motion compensation so that the texture
discontinuity problem can be solved. The proposed scheme is implemented in the
reference software of High Efficiency Video Coding. Compared with the existing
method, the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the rate-distortion
performance. The experimental results obviously demonstrate that the texture
discontinuity in the face boundary can be well handled by the proposed
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of strong coordination of actions of two agents $X$ and
$Y$ that communicate over a noisy communication channel such that the actions
follow a given joint probability distribution. We propose two novel schemes for
this noisy strong coordination problem, and derive inner bounds for the
underlying strong coordination capacity region. The first scheme is a joint
coordination-channel coding scheme that utilizes the randomness provided by the
communication channel to reduce the local randomness required in generating the
action sequence at agent $Y$. The second scheme exploits separate coordination
and channel coding where local randomness is extracted from the channel after
decoding. Finally, we present an example in which the joint scheme is able to
outperform the separate scheme in terms of coordination rate.

 <dc:description>  Blind deblurring consists a long studied task, however the outcomes of
generic methods are not effective in real world blurred images. Domain-specific
methods for deblurring targeted object categories, e.g. text or faces,
frequently outperform their generic counterparts, hence they are attracting an
increasing amount of attention. In this work, we develop such a domain-specific
method to tackle deblurring of human faces, henceforth referred to as face
deblurring. Studying faces is of tremendous significance in computer vision,
however face deblurring has yet to demonstrate some convincing results. This
can be partly attributed to the combination of i) poor texture and ii) highly
structure shape that yield the contour/gradient priors (that are typically
used) sub-optimal. In our work instead of making assumptions over the prior, we
adopt a learning approach by inserting weak supervision that exploits the
well-documented structure of the face. Namely, we utilise a deep network to
perform the deblurring and employ a face alignment technique to pre-process
each face. We additionally surpass the requirement of the deep network for
thousands training samples, by introducing an efficient framework that allows
the generation of a large dataset. We utilised this framework to create 2MF2, a
dataset of over two million frames. We conducted experiments with real world
blurred facial images and report that our method returns a result close to the
sharp natural latent image.

 <dc:title>Genealogical Distance as a Diversity Estimate in Evolutionary Algorithms</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The evolutionary edit distance between two individuals in a population, i.e.,
the amount of applications of any genetic operator it would take the
evolutionary process to generate one individual starting from the other, seems
like a promising estimate for the diversity between said individuals. We
introduce genealogical diversity, i.e., estimating two individuals' degree of
relatedness by analyzing large, unused parts of their genome, as a
computationally efficient method to approximate that measure for diversity.

 <dc:title>Partially Occluded Leaf Recognition via Subgraph Matching and Energy

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an approach to match partially occluded plant leaves with
databases of full plant leaves. Although contour based 2D shape matching has
been studied extensively in the last couple of decades, matching occluded
leaves with full leaf databases is an open and little worked on problem.
Classifying occluded plant leaves is even more challenging than full leaf
matching because of large variations and complexity of leaf structures.
Matching an occluded contour with all the full contours in a database is an
NP-hard problem [Su et al. ICCV2015], so our algorithm is necessarily
suboptimal.

 <dc:title>Learning Quadratic Variance Function (QVF) DAG models via OverDispersion
  Scoring (ODS)</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Learning DAG or Bayesian network models is an important problem in
multi-variate causal inference. However, a number of challenges arises in
learning large-scale DAG models including model identifiability and
computational complexity since the space of directed graphs is huge. In this
paper, we address these issues in a number of steps for a broad class of DAG
models where the noise or variance is signal-dependent. Firstly we introduce a
new class of identifiable DAG models, where each node has a distribution where
the variance is a quadratic function of the mean (QVF DAG models). Our QVF DAG
models include many interesting classes of distributions such as Poisson,
Binomial, Geometric, Exponential, Gamma and many other distributions in which
the noise variance depends on the mean. We prove that this class of QVF DAG
models is identifiable, and introduce a new algorithm, the OverDispersion
Scoring (ODS) algorithm, for learning large-scale QVF DAG models. Our algorithm
is based on firstly learning the moralized or undirected graphical model
representation of the DAG to reduce the DAG search-space, and then exploiting
the quadratic variance property to learn the causal ordering. We show through
theoretical results and simulations that our algorithm is statistically
consistent in the high-dimensional p&gt;n setting provided that the degree of the
moralized graph is bounded and performs well compared to state-of-the-art
DAG-learning algorithms.

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In deep learning, performance is strongly affected by the choice of
architecture and hyperparameters. While there has been extensive work on
automatic hyperparameter optimization for simple spaces, complex spaces such as
the space of deep architectures remain largely unexplored. As a result, the
choice of architecture is done manually by the human expert through a slow
trial and error process guided mainly by intuition. In this paper we describe a
framework for automatically designing and training deep models. We propose an
extensible and modular language that allows the human expert to compactly
represent complex search spaces over architectures and their hyperparameters.
The resulting search spaces are tree-structured and therefore easy to traverse.
Models can be automatically compiled to computational graphs once values for
all hyperparameters have been chosen. We can leverage the structure of the
search space to introduce different model search algorithms, such as random
search, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), and sequential model-based optimization
(SMBO). We present experiments comparing the different algorithms on CIFAR-10
and show that MCTS and SMBO outperform random search. In addition, these
experiments show that our framework can be used effectively for model
discovery, as it is possible to describe expressive search spaces and discover
competitive models without much effort from the human expert. Code for our
framework and experiments has been made publicly available.

 <dc:description>  We propose to directly map raw visual observations and text input to actions
for instruction execution. While existing approaches assume access to
structured environment representations or use a pipeline of separately trained
models, we learn a single model to jointly reason about linguistic and visual
input. We use reinforcement learning in a contextual bandit setting to train a
neural network agent. To guide the agent's exploration, we use reward shaping
with different forms of supervision. Our approach does not require intermediate
representations, planning procedures, or training different models. We evaluate
in a simulated environment, and show significant improvements over supervised
learning and common reinforcement learning variants.

 <dc:description>  Risk stratification of lung nodules is a task of primary importance in lung
cancer diagnosis. Any improvement in robust and accurate nodule
characterization can assist in identifying cancer stage, prognosis, and
improving treatment planning. In this study, we propose a 3D Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) based nodule characterization strategy. With a completely
3D approach, we utilize the volumetric information from a CT scan which would
be otherwise lost in the conventional 2D CNN based approaches. In order to
address the need for a large amount for training data for CNN, we resort to
transfer learning to obtain highly discriminative features. Moreover, we also
acquire the task dependent feature representation for six high-level nodule
attributes and fuse this complementary information via a Multi-task learning
(MTL) framework. Finally, we propose to incorporate potential disagreement
among radiologists while scoring different nodule attributes in a graph
regularized sparse multi-task learning. We evaluated our proposed approach on
one of the largest publicly available lung nodule datasets comprising 1018
scans and obtained state-of-the-art results in regressing the malignancy
scores.

 <dc:description>  Words often convey affect -- emotions, feelings, and attitudes. Lexicons of
word-affect association have applications in automatic emotion analysis and
natural language generation. However, existing lexicons indicate only coarse
categories of affect association. Here, for the first time, we create an affect
intensity lexicon with real-valued scores of association. We use a technique
called best-worst scaling that improves annotation consistency and obtains
reliable fine-grained scores. The lexicon includes terms common from both
general English and terms specific to social media communications. It has close
to 6,000 entries for four basic emotions. We will be adding entries for other
affect dimensions shortly.

 <dc:description>  Despite the impressive improvements achieved by unsupervised deep neural
networks in computer vision and NLP tasks, such improvements have not yet been
observed in ranking for information retrieval. The reason may be the complexity
of the ranking problem, as it is not obvious how to learn from queries and
documents when no supervised signal is available. Hence, in this paper, we
propose to train a neural ranking model using weak supervision, where labels
are obtained automatically without human annotators or any external resources
(e.g., click data). To this aim, we use the output of an unsupervised ranking
model, such as BM25, as a weak supervision signal. We further train a set of
simple yet effective ranking models based on feed-forward neural networks. We
study their effectiveness under various learning scenarios (point-wise and
pair-wise models) and using different input representations (i.e., from
encoding query-document pairs into dense/sparse vectors to using word embedding
representation). We train our networks using tens of millions of training
instances and evaluate it on two standard collections: a homogeneous news
collection(Robust) and a heterogeneous large-scale web collection (ClueWeb).
Our experiments indicate that employing proper objective functions and letting
the networks to learn the input representation based on weakly supervised data
leads to impressive performance, with over 13% and 35% MAP improvements over
the BM25 model on the Robust and the ClueWeb collections. Our findings also
suggest that supervised neural ranking models can greatly benefit from
pre-training on large amounts of weakly labeled data that can be easily
obtained from unsupervised IR models.

ambiguity issue in semantic segmentation by proposing a global background
attenuation model. A spatial-temporal refinement network is developed to
further refine the segmentation errors in each frame and ensure temporal
coherence in the segmentation map. We form an end-to-end network for training
and testing. Each module is designed considering efficiency and accuracy. We
build a portrait dataset, which includes 8,000 images with high-quality labeled
map for training and testing. To further improve the performance, we build a
portrait video dataset with 50 sequences to fine-tune video segmentation. Our
framework benefits many video processing applications.

 <dc:creator>Sepasdar, Zahra</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Quasi-cyclic (QC) codes form an important generalization of cyclic codes. It
is well know that QC codes of length $s\ell$ with index $s$ over the finite
field $\mathbb{F}$ are $\mathbb{F}[y]$-submodules of the ring
$\frac{\mathbb{F}[x,y]}{&lt; x^s-1,y^{\ell}-1 &gt;}$. The aim of the present paper,
is to study QC codes of length $s\ell$ with index $s$ over the finite field
$\mathbb{F}$ and find generator polynomials and generator matrix for these
codes. To achieve this aim, we apply a novel method to find generator
polynomials for $\mathbb{F}[y]$-submodules of $\frac{\mathbb{F}[x,y]}{&lt;
x^s-1,y^{\ell}-1 &gt;}$. These polynomials will be applied to obtain generator
matrix for corresponding QC codes.

 <dc:title>A Tribe Competition-Based Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection in
  Pattern Classification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Feature selection has always been a critical step in pattern recognition, in
which evolutionary algorithms, such as the genetic algorithm (GA), are most
commonly used. However, the individual encoding scheme used in various GAs
would either pose a bias on the solution or require a pre-specified number of
features, and hence may lead to less accurate results. In this paper, a tribe
competition-based genetic algorithm (TCbGA) is proposed for feature selection
in pattern classification. The population of individuals is divided into
multiple tribes, and the initialization and evolutionary operations are
modified to ensure that the number of selected features in each tribe follows a
Gaussian distribution. Thus each tribe focuses on exploring a specific part of
the solution space. Meanwhile, tribe competition is introduced to the evolution
process, which allows the winning tribes, which produce better individuals, to
enlarge their sizes, i.e. having more individuals to search their parts of the
solution space. This algorithm, therefore, avoids the bias on solutions and
requirement of a pre-specified number of features. We have evaluated our
algorithm against several state-of-the-art feature selection approaches on 20
benchmark datasets. Our results suggest that the proposed TCbGA algorithm can
identify the optimal feature subset more effectively and produce more accurate
pattern classification.

 <dc:title>Stream Processing using Grammars and Regular Expressions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rasmussen, Ulrik Terp</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this dissertation we study regular expression based parsing and the use of
grammatical specifications for the synthesis of fast, streaming
string-processing programs.
  In the first part we develop two linear-time algorithms for regular
expression based parsing with Perl-style greedy disambiguation. The first
algorithm operates in two passes in a semi-streaming fashion, using a constant
amount of working memory and an auxiliary tape storage which is written in the
first pass and consumed by the second. The second algorithm is a single-pass
and optimally streaming algorithm which outputs as much of the parse tree as is
semantically possible based on the input prefix read so far, and resorts to
buffering as many symbols as is required to resolve the next choice. Optimality
is obtained by performing a PSPACE-complete pre-analysis on the regular
expression.
  In the second part we present Kleenex, a language for expressing
high-performance streaming string processing programs as regular grammars with
embedded semantic actions, and its compilation to streaming string transducers
with worst-case linear-time performance. Its underlying theory is based on
transducer decomposition into oracle and action machines, and a finite-state
specialization of the streaming parsing algorithm presented in the first part.
In the second part we also develop a new linear-time streaming parsing
algorithm for parsing expression grammars (PEG) which generalizes the regular
grammars of Kleenex. The algorithm is based on a bottom-up tabulation algorithm
reformulated using least fixed points and evaluated using an instance of the
chaotic iteration scheme by Cousot and Cousot.

 <dc:description>  A discriminative ensemble tracker employs multiple classifiers, each of which
casts a vote on all of the obtained samples. The votes are then aggregated in
an attempt to localize the target object. Such method relies on collective
competence and the diversity of the ensemble to approach the target/non-target
classification task from different views. However, by updating all of the
ensemble using a shared set of samples and their final labels, such diversity
is lost or reduced to the diversity provided by the underlying features or
internal classifiers' dynamics. Additionally, the classifiers do not exchange
information with each other while striving to serve the collective goal, i.e.,
better classification. In this study, we propose an active collaborative
information exchange scheme for ensemble tracking. This, not only orchestrates
different classifier towards a common goal but also provides an intelligent
update mechanism to keep the diversity of classifiers and to mitigate the
shortcomings of one with the others. The data exchange is optimized with regard
to an ensemble uncertainty utility function, and the ensemble is updated via
co-training. The evaluations demonstrate promising results realized by the
proposed algorithm for the real-world online tracking.

 <dc:title>A new image compression by gradient Haar wavelet</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sadra, Yaser</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the development of human communications the usage of Visual
Communications has also increased. The advancement of image compression methods
is one of the main reasons for the enhancement. This paper first presents main
modes of image compression methods such as JPEG and JPEG2000 without
mathematical details. Also, the paper describes gradient Haar wavelet
transforms in order to construct a preliminary image compression algorithm.
Then, a new image compression method is proposed based on the preliminary image
compression algorithm that can improve standards of image compression. The new
method is compared with original modes of JPEG and JPEG2000 (based on Haar
wavelet) by image quality measures such as MAE, PSNAR, and SSIM. The image
quality and statistical results confirm that can boost image compression
standards. It is suggested that the new method is used in a part or all of an
image compression standard.

 <dc:title>Spectral-Efficient Analog Precoding for Generalized Spatial Modulation
  Aided MmWave MIMO</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Generalized spatial modulation (GenSM) aided millimeter wave (mmWave)
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has recently received substantial
academic attention. However, due to the insufficient exploitation of the
transmitter's knowledge of the channel state information (CSI), the achievable
rates of state-of-the-art GenSM-aided mmWave MIMO systems are far from being
optimal. Against this background, a novel analog precoding scheme is proposed
in this paper to improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of conventional
GenSM-aided mmWave MIMOs. More specifically, we firstly manage to lower-bound
the achievable SE of GenSM-aided mmWave MIMO with a closed-form expression.
Secondly, by exploiting this lower bound as a cost function, a low-complexity
iterative algorithm is proposed to design the analog precoder for SE
maximization. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to substantiate the
superior performance of the proposed design with respect to state-of-the-art
GenSM-aided mmWave MIMO schemes.

 <dc:description>  Due to the high cost and low energy efficiency of the dedicated radio
frequency (RF) chains, the number of RF chains in a millimeter wave (mmWave)
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system is usually limited from a
practical point of view. In this case, the maximum number of independent data
streams is also restricted by the number of RF chains, which consequently leads
to limiting the potentially attainable spatial multiplexing gain. In order to
address this issue, in this paper, a novel generalized spatial modulation
(GenSM) aided mmWave MIMO system is proposed, which enables the transmission of
an extra data stream via the index of the active antennas group and requires no
extra RF chain. Moreover, a two-step algorithm is also proposed to optimize the
hybrid precoder design with respect to spectral efficiency (SE) maximization.
Finally, numerical simulation results demonstrate the superior SE performance
achieved by the proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a general graph representation learning framework called
DeepGL for learning deep node and edge representations from large (attributed)
graphs. In particular, DeepGL begins by deriving a set of base features (e.g.,
graphlet features) and automatically learns a multi-layered hierarchical graph
representation where each successive layer leverages the output from the
previous layer to learn features of a higher-order. Contrary to previous work,
DeepGL learns relational functions (each representing a feature) that
generalize across-networks and therefore useful for graph-based transfer
learning tasks. Moreover, DeepGL naturally supports attributed graphs, learns
interpretable features, and is space-efficient (by learning sparse feature
vectors). In addition, DeepGL is expressive, flexible with many interchangeable
components, efficient with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(|E|)$, and
scalable for large networks via an efficient parallel implementation. Compared
with the state-of-the-art method, DeepGL is (1) effective for across-network
transfer learning tasks and attributed graph representation learning, (2)
space-efficient requiring up to 6x less memory, (3) fast with up to 182x
speedup in runtime performance, and (4) accurate with an average improvement of
20% or more on many learning tasks.

 <dc:title>Outline Colorization through Tandem Adversarial Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  When creating digital art, coloring and shading are often time consuming
tasks that follow the same general patterns. A solution to automatically
colorize raw line art would have many practical applications. We propose a
setup utilizing two networks in tandem: a color prediction network based only
on outlines, and a shading network conditioned on both outlines and a color
scheme. We present processing methods to limit information passed in the color
scheme, improving generalization. Finally, we demonstrate natural-looking
results when colorizing outlines from scratch, as well as from a messy,
user-defined color scheme.

 <dc:description>  Online graph problems are considered in models where the irrevocability
requirement is relaxed. Motivated by practical examples where, for example,
there is a cost associated with building a facility and no extra cost
associated with doing it later, we consider the Late Accept model, where a
request can be accepted at a later point, but any acceptance is irrevocable.
Similarly, we also consider a Late Reject model, where an accepted request can
later be rejected, but any rejection is irrevocable (this is sometimes called
preemption). Finally, we consider the Late Accept/Reject model, where late
accepts and rejects are both allowed, but any late reject is irrevocable. For
Independent Set, the Late Accept/Reject model is necessary to obtain a constant
competitive ratio, but for Vertex Cover the Late Accept model is sufficient and
for Minimum Spanning Forest the Late Reject model is sufficient. The Matching
problem has a competitive ratio of 2, but in the Late Accept/Reject model, its
competitive ratio is 3/2.

 <dc:description>  The problem of how to coordinate a large fleet of trucks with given itinerary
to enable fuel-efficient platooning is considered. Platooning is a promising
technology that enables trucks to save significant amounts of fuel by driving
close together and thus reducing air drag. A setting is considered in which
each truck in a fleet is provided with a start location, a destination, a
departure time, and an arrival deadline from a higher planning level.
Fuel-efficient plans should be computed. The plans consist of routes and speed
profiles that allow trucks to arrive by their arrival deadlines. Hereby, trucks
can meet on common parts of their routes and form platoons, resulting in
decreased fuel consumption.
  We formulate a combinatorial optimization problem that combines plans
involving only two vehicles. We show that this problem is hard to solve for
large problem instances. Hence a heuristic algorithm is proposed. The resulting
plans are further optimized using convex optimization techniques. The method is
evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations in a realistic setting. We demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm can compute plans for thousands of trucks and that
significant fuel savings can be achieved.

 <dc:description>  Image reconstruction plays a critical role in the implementation of all
contemporary imaging modalities across the physical and life sciences including
optical, MRI, CT, PET, and radio astronomy. During an image acquisition, the
sensor encodes an intermediate representation of an object in the sensor
domain, which is subsequently reconstructed into an image by an inversion of
the encoding function. Image reconstruction is challenging because analytic
knowledge of the inverse transform may not exist a priori, especially in the
presence of sensor non-idealities and noise. Thus, the standard reconstruction
approach involves approximating the inverse function with multiple ad hoc
stages in a signal processing chain whose composition depends on the details of
each acquisition strategy, and often requires expert parameter tuning to
optimize reconstruction performance. We present here a unified framework for
image reconstruction, AUtomated TransfOrm by Manifold APproximation (AUTOMAP),
which recasts image reconstruction as a data-driven, supervised learning task
that allows a mapping between sensor and image domain to emerge from an
appropriate corpus of training data. We implement AUTOMAP with a deep neural
network and exhibit its flexibility in learning reconstruction transforms for a
variety of MRI acquisition strategies, using the same network architecture and
hyperparameters. We further demonstrate its efficiency in sparsely representing
transforms along low-dimensional manifolds, resulting in superior immunity to
noise and reconstruction artifacts compared with conventional handcrafted
reconstruction methods. In addition to improving the reconstruction performance
of existing acquisition methodologies, we anticipate accelerating the discovery
of new acquisition strategies across modalities as the burden of reconstruction
becomes lifted by AUTOMAP and learned-reconstruction approaches.

 <dc:description>  We introduce Parseval networks, a form of deep neural networks in which the
Lipschitz constant of linear, convolutional and aggregation layers is
constrained to be smaller than 1. Parseval networks are empirically and
theoretically motivated by an analysis of the robustness of the predictions
made by deep neural networks when their input is subject to an adversarial
perturbation. The most important feature of Parseval networks is to maintain
weight matrices of linear and convolutional layers to be (approximately)
Parseval tight frames, which are extensions of orthogonal matrices to
non-square matrices. We describe how these constraints can be maintained
efficiently during SGD. We show that Parseval networks match the
state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy on CIFAR-10/100 and Street View House
Numbers (SVHN) while being more robust than their vanilla counterpart against
adversarial examples. Incidentally, Parseval networks also tend to train faster
and make a better usage of the full capacity of the networks.

 <dc:description>  The wide spread of location-based social networks brings about a huge volume
of user check-in data, which facilitates the recommendation of points of
interest (POIs). Recent advances on distributed representation shed light on
learning low dimensional dense vectors to alleviate the data sparsity problem.
Current studies on representation learning for POI recommendation embed both
users and POIs in a common latent space, and users' preference is inferred
based on the distance/similarity between a user and a POI. Such an approach is
not in accordance with the semantics of users and POIs as they are inherently
different objects. In this paper, we present a novel spatiotemporal aware (STA)
representation, which models the spatial and temporal information as \emph{a
relationship connecting users and POIs}. Our model generalizes the recent
advances in knowledge graph embedding. The basic idea is that the embedding of
a $&lt;$time, location$&gt;$ pair corresponds to a translation from embeddings of
users to POIs. Since the POI embedding should be close to the user embedding
plus the relationship vector, the recommendation can be performed by selecting
the top-\emph{k} POIs similar to the translated POI, which are all of the same
type of objects. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets.
The results demonstrate that our STA model achieves the state-of-the-art
performance in terms of high recommendation accuracy, robustness to data
sparsity and effectiveness in handling cold start problem.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study multi-agent discrete-event systems where the agents
can be divided into several groups, and within each group the agents have
similar or identical state transition structures. We employ a relabeling map to
generate a &quot;template structure&quot; for each group, and synthesize a scalable
supervisor whose state size and computational process are independent of the
number of agents. This scalability allows the supervisor to remain invariant
(no recomputation or reconfiguration needed) if and when there are agents
removed due to failure or added for increasing productivity. The constant
computational effort for synthesizing the scalable supervisor also makes our
method promising for handling large-scale multi-agent systems. Moreover, based
on the scalable supervisor we design scalable local controllers, one for each
component agent, to establish a purely distributed control architecture. Three
examples are provided to illustrate our proposed scalable supervisory synthesis
and the resulting scalable supervisors as well as local controllers.

 <dc:description>  To improve national security, government agencies have long been committed to
enforcing powerful surveillance measures on suspicious individuals or
communications. In this paper, we consider a wireless legitimate surveillance
system, where a full-duplex multi-antenna legitimate monitor aims to eavesdrop
on a dubious communication link between a suspicious pair via proactive
jamming. Assuming that the legitimate monitor can successfully overhear the
suspicious information only when its achievable data rate is no smaller than
that of the suspicious receiver, the key objective is to maximize the
eavesdropping non-outage probability by joint design of the jamming power,
receive and transmit beamformers at the legitimate monitor. Depending on the
number of receive/transmit antennas implemented, i.e., single-input
single-output, single-input multiple-output, multiple-input single-output and
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), four different scenarios are
investigated. For each scenario, the optimal jamming power is derived in
closed-form and efficient algorithms are obtained for the optimal
transmit/receive beamforming vectors. Moreover, low-complexity suboptimal
beamforming schemes are proposed for the MIMO case. Our analytical findings
demonstrate that by exploiting multiple antennas at the legitimate monitor, the
eavesdropping non-outage probability can be significantly improved compared to
the single antenna case. In addition, the proposed suboptimal transmit
zero-forcing scheme yields similar performance as the optimal scheme.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A proper initialization of the weights in a neural network is critical to its
convergence. Current insights into weight initialization come primarily from
linear activation functions. In this paper, I develop a theory for weight
initializations with non-linear activations. First, I derive a general weight
initialization strategy for any neural network using activation functions
differentiable at 0. Next, I derive the weight initialization strategy for the
Rectified Linear Unit (RELU), and provide theoretical insights into why the
Xavier initialization is a poor choice with RELU activations. My analysis
provides a clear demonstration of the role of non-linearities in determining
the proper weight initializations.

 <dc:description>  In $(k,r)$-Center we are given a (possibly edge-weighted) graph and are asked
to select at most $k$ vertices (centers), so that all other vertices are at
distance at most $r$ from a center. In this paper we provide a number of tight
fine-grained bounds on the complexity of this problem with respect to various
standard graph parameters. Specifically: - For any $r\ge 1$, we show an
algorithm that solves the problem in $O^*((3r+1)^{\textrm{cw}})$ time, where
$\textrm{cw}$ is the clique-width of the input graph, as well as a tight SETH
lower bound matching this algorithm's performance. As a corollary, for $r=1$,
this closes the gap that previously existed on the complexity of Dominating Set
parameterized by $\textrm{cw}$. - We strengthen previously known FPT lower
bounds, by showing that $(k,r)$-Center is W[1]-hard parameterized by the input
graph's vertex cover (if edge weights are allowed), or feedback vertex set,
even if $k$ is an additional parameter. Our reductions imply tight ETH-based
lower bounds. Finally, we devise an algorithm parameterized by vertex cover for
unweighted graphs. - We show that the complexity of the problem parameterized
by tree-depth is $2^{\Theta(\textrm{td}^2)}$ by showing an algorithm of this
complexity and a tight ETH-based lower bound. We complement these mostly
negative results by providing FPT approximation schemes parameterized by
clique-width or treewidth which work efficiently independently of the values of
$k,r$. In particular, we give algorithms which, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, run in
time $O^*((\textrm{tw}/\epsilon)^{O(\textrm{tw})})$,
$O^*((\textrm{cw}/\epsilon)^{O(\textrm{cw})})$ and return a
$(k,(1+\epsilon)r)$-center, if a $(k,r)$-center exists, thus circumventing the
problem's W-hardness.

 <dc:description>  The design of mixed-criticality systems often involvespainful tradeoffs
between safety guarantees and performance.However, the use of more detailed
architectural modelsin the design and analysis of scheduling arrangements for
mixedcriticalitysystems can provide greater confidence in the analysis,but also
opportunities for better performance. Motivated by thisview, we propose an
extension of Vestal 19s model for mixedcriticalitymulticore systems that (i)
accounts for the per-taskpartitioning of the last-level cache and (ii) supports
the dynamicreassignment, for better schedulability, of cache portions
initiallyreserved for lower-criticality tasks to the higher-criticalitytasks,
when the system switches to high-criticality mode. Tothis model, we apply
partitioned EDF scheduling with Ekbergand Yi 19s deadline-scaling technique.
Our schedulability analysisand scalefactor calculation is cognisant of the
cache resourcesassigned to each task, by using WCET estimates that take
intoaccount these resources. It is hence able to leverage the
dynamicreconfiguration of the cache partitioning, at mode change, forbetter
performance, in terms of provable schedulability. We alsopropose heuristics for
partitioning the cache in low- and highcriticalitymode, that promote
schedulability. Our experimentswith synthetic task sets, indicate tangible
improvements inschedulability compared to a baseline cache-aware
arrangementwhere there is no redistribution of cache resources from low-
tohigh-criticality tasks in the event of a mode change.

 <dc:title>Deterministic Gathering with Crash Faults</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pelc, Andrzej</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A team consisting of an unknown number of mobile agents, starting from
different nodes of an unknown network, have to meet at the same node and
terminate. This problem is known as {\em gathering}. We study deterministic
gathering algorithms under the assumption that agents are subject to {\em crash
faults} which can occur at any time. Two fault scenarios are considered. A {\em
motion fault} immobilizes the agent at a node or inside an edge but leaves
intact its memory at the time when the fault occurred. A more severe {\em total
fault} immobilizes the agent as well, but also erases its entire memory. Of
course, we cannot require faulty agents to gather. Thus the gathering problem
for fault prone agents calls for all fault-free agents to gather at a single
node, and terminate.
  When agents move completely asynchronously, gathering with crash faults of
any type is impossible. Hence we consider a restricted version of asynchrony,
where each agent is assigned by the adversary a fixed speed, possibly different
for each agent. Agents have clocks ticking at the same rate. Each agent can
wait for a time of its choice at any node, or decide to traverse an edge but
then it moves at constant speed assigned to it. Moreover, agents have different
labels. Each agent knows its label and speed but not those of other agents.
  We construct a gathering algorithm working for any team of at least two
agents in the scenario of motion faults, and a gathering algorithm working in
the presence of total faults, provided that at least two agents are fault free
all the time. If only one agent is fault free, the task of gathering with total
faults is sometimes impossible. Both our algorithms work in time polynomial in
the size of the graph, in the logarithm of the largest label, in the inverse of
the smallest speed, and in the ratio between the largest and the smallest
speed.

 <dc:description>  Many modern approaches for object detection are two-staged pipelines. The
first stage identifies regions of interest which are then classified in the
second stage. Faster R-CNN is such an approach for object detection which
combines both stages into a single pipeline. In this paper we apply Faster
R-CNN to the task of company logo detection. Motivated by its weak performance
on small object instances, we examine in detail both the proposal and the
classification stage with respect to a wide range of object sizes. We
investigate the influence of feature map resolution on the performance of those
stages.
  Based on theoretical considerations, we introduce an improved scheme for
generating anchor proposals and propose a modification to Faster R-CNN which
leverages higher-resolution feature maps for small objects. We evaluate our
approach on the FlickrLogos dataset improving the RPN performance from 0.52 to
0.71 (MABO) and the detection performance from 0.52 to 0.67 (mAP).

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in combining deep neural network architectures with
reinforcement learning techniques have shown promising potential results in
solving complex control problems with high dimensional state and action spaces.
Inspired by these successes, in this paper, we build two kinds of reinforcement
learning algorithms: deep policy-gradient and value-function based agents which
can predict the best possible traffic signal for a traffic intersection. At
each time step, these adaptive traffic light control agents receive a snapshot
of the current state of a graphical traffic simulator and produce control
signals. The policy-gradient based agent maps its observation directly to the
control signal, however the value-function based agent first estimates values
for all legal control signals. The agent then selects the optimal control
action with the highest value. Our methods show promising results in a traffic
network simulated in the SUMO traffic simulator, without suffering from
instability issues during the training process.

 <dc:description>  What is a finite-state strategy in a delay game? We answer this surprisingly
non-trivial question and present a very general framework for computing such
strategies: they exist for all winning conditions that are recognized by
automata with acceptance conditions that satisfy a certain aggregation
property. Our framework also yields upper bounds on the complexity of
determining the winner of such delay games and upper bounds on the necessary
lookahead to win the game. In particular, we cover all previous results of that
kind as special cases of our uniform approach.

 <dc:description>  Discourse-annotated corpora are an important resource for the community.
However, these corpora are often annotated according to different frameworks,
making comparison of the annotations difficult. This is unfortunate, since
mapping the existing annotations would result in more (training) data for
researchers in automatic discourse relation processing and researchers in
linguistics and psycholinguistics. In this article, we present an effort to map
two large corpora onto each other: the Penn Discourse Treebank and the
Rhetorical Structure Theory Discourse Treebank. We first propose a method for
aligning the discourse segments, and then evaluate the observed against the
expected mappings for explicit and implicit relations separately. We find that
while agreement on explicit relations is reasonable, agreement between the
frameworks on implicit relations is astonishingly low. We identify sources of
systematic discrepancies between the two annotation schemes; many of the
differences in annotation can be traced back to different operationalizations
and goals of the PDTB and RST frameworks. We discuss the consequences of these
discrepancies for future annotation, and the usability of the mapped data for
theoretical studies and the training of automatic discourse relation labellers.

 <dc:description>  Aboria is a powerful and flexible C++ library for the implementation of
particle-based numerical methods. The particles in such methods can represent
actual particles (e.g. Molecular Dynamics) or abstract particles used to
discretise a continuous function over a domain (e.g. Radial Basis Functions).
Aboria provides a particle container, compatible with the Standard Template
Library, spatial search data structures, and a Domain Specific Language to
specify non-linear operators on the particle set. This paper gives an overview
of Aboria's design, an example of use, and a performance benchmark.

 <dc:description>  We propose to constrain segmentation functionals with a dimensionless,
unbiased and position-independent shape compactness prior, which we solve
efficiently with an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
Involving a squared sum of pairwise potentials, our prior results in a
challenging high-order optimization problem, which involves dense (fully
connected) graphs. We split the problem into a sequence of easier sub-problems,
each performed efficiently at each iteration: (i) a sparse-matrix inversion
based on Woodbury identity, (ii) a closed-form solution of a cubic equation and
(iii) a graph-cut update of a sub-modular pairwise sub-problem with a sparse
graph. We deploy our prior in an energy minimization, in conjunction with a
supervised classifier term based on CNNs and standard regularization
constraints. We demonstrate the usefulness of our energy in several medical
applications. In particular, we report comprehensive evaluations of our fully
automated algorithm over 40 subjects, showing a competitive performance for the
challenging task of abdominal aorta segmentation in MRI.

 <dc:title>A Constructive Framework for Galois Connections</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Abstract interpretation-based static analyses rely on abstract domains of
program properties, such as intervals or congruences for integer variables.
Galois connections (GCs) between posets provide the most widespread and useful
formal tool for mathematically specifying abstract domains. Recently, Darais
and Van Horn [2016] put forward a notion of constructive Galois connection for
unordered sets (rather than posets), which allows to define abstract domains in
a so-called mechanized and calculational proof style and therefore enables the
use of proof assistants like Coq and Agda for automatically extracting verified
algorithms of static analysis. We show here that constructive GCs are
isomorphic, in a precise and comprehensive meaning including sound abstract
functions, to so-called partitioning GCs--an already known class of GCs which
allows to cast standard set partitions as an abstract domain. Darais and Van
Horn [2016] also provide a notion of constructive GC for posets, which we prove
to be isomorphic to plain GCs and therefore lose their constructive attribute.
Drawing on these findings, we put forward and advocate the use of purely
partitioning GCs, a novel class of constructive abstract domains for a
mechanized approach to abstract interpretation. We show that this class of
abstract domains allows us to represent a set partition with more flexibility
while retaining a constructive approach to Galois connections.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present techniques and examples to reduce power consumption
and increase energy efficiency of autonomous wireless sensor nodes for the
Internet of Things. We focus on RF energy harvesting and data transfer, all of
which have a large impact on the device cost, lifetime and functionality. We
explore the co-design of antenna and electronics to increase RF-DC conversion
and efficiency and to improve the performance of the LNA. A high-efficiency
orthogonally switching charge pump rectifier is presented. Its measurement
results are presented, along with a discussion on how to define its power
conversion efficiency. To boost the rectifier output voltage, while presenting
the best output load to it, a DC-DC converter with maximum power point tracking
is presented. To transmit slowly-varying signals in a low-power manner, an
asynchronous data converter is discussed and two modalities of data
transmission are presented. The first one is a passive transmitter
implementation and the second a novel low-power sub-GHz UWB transmitter.

 <dc:description>  In this chapter, we analyze nonlinear filtering problems in distributed
environments, e.g., sensor networks or peer-to-peer protocols. In these
scenarios, the agents in the environment receive measurements in a streaming
fashion, and they are required to estimate a common (nonlinear) model by
alternating local computations and communications with their neighbors. We
focus on the important distinction between single-task problems, where the
underlying model is common to all agents, and multitask problems, where each
agent might converge to a different model due to, e.g., spatial dependencies or
other factors. Currently, most of the literature on distributed learning in the
nonlinear case has focused on the single-task case, which may be a strong
limitation in real-world scenarios. After introducing the problem and reviewing
the existing approaches, we describe a simple kernel-based algorithm tailored
for the multitask case. We evaluate the proposal on a simulated benchmark task,
and we conclude by detailing currently open problems and lines of research.

 <dc:description>  We present SuperPivot, an analysis method for low-resource languages that
occur in a superparallel corpus, i.e., in a corpus that contains an order of
magnitude more languages than parallel corpora currently in use. We show that
SuperPivot performs well for the crosslingual analysis of the linguistic
phenomenon of tense. We produce analysis results for more than 1000 languages,
conducting - to the best of our knowledge - the largest crosslingual
computational study performed to date. We extend existing methodology for
leveraging parallel corpora for typological analysis by overcoming a limiting
assumption of earlier work: We only require that a linguistic feature is
overtly marked in a few of thousands of languages as opposed to requiring that
it be marked in all languages under investigation.

 <dc:title>OSPF extension for the support of multi-area networks with arbitrary

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>C.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  OSPF currently supports multi-area networking with two severe limitations,
due to the distance vector approach taken in the inter-area routing protocol:
(i) the multi-area topology is restricted to a two-level hierarchy, and (ii)
globally optimal routing may not be achieved. In this letter, we propose an
OSPF extension that overcomes these limitations by adopting a link state
inter-area routing protocol. The extension applies to both OSPFv2 (IPv4) and
OSPFv3 (IPv6), and is fully transparent to area-internal routers. Despite its
simplicity, this extension may have a large impact in the operation of the
current Internet.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel approach to enable the coexistence between
Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) radar and downlink multi-user
Multi-Input-Single-Output (MU-MISO) communication system. By exploiting the
constructive multi-user interference (MUI), the proposed approach trades-off
useful MUI power for reducing the transmit power, to obtain a power efficient
transmission. This paper focuses on two optimization problems: a) Transmit
power minimization at the base station (BS) while guaranteeing the receive
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) level of downlink users and the
interference-to-noise ratio (INR) level to radar; b) Minimization of the
interference from BS to radar for a given requirement of downlink SINR and
transmit power budget. To reduce the computational overhead of the proposed
scheme in practice, an algorithm based on gradient projection is designed to
solve the power minimization problem. In addition, we investigate the trade-off
between the performance of radar and communication, and analytically derive the
key metrics for MIMO radar in the presence of the interference from the BS.
Finally, a robust power minimization problem is formulated to ensure the
effectiveness of the proposed method in the case of imperfect Channel State
Information (CSI). Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves a
significant power saving compared to conventional approaches, while obtaining a
favorable performance-complexity trade-off.

 <dc:title>A Framework for Rate Efficient Control of Distributed Discrete Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A key issue in the control of distributed discrete systems modeled as Markov
decisions processes, is that often the state of the system is not directly
observable at any single location in the system. The participants in the
control scheme must share information with one another regarding the state of
the system in order to collectively make informed control decisions, but this
information sharing can be costly. Harnessing recent results from information
theory regarding distributed function computation, in this paper we derive, for
several information sharing model structures, the minimum amount of control
information that must be exchanged to enable local participants to derive the
same control decisions as an imaginary omniscient controller having full
knowledge of the global state. Incorporating consideration for this amount of
information that must be exchanged into the reward enables one to trade the
competing objectives of minimizing this control information exchange and
maximizing the performance of the controller. An alternating optimization
framework is then provided to help find the efficient controllers and messaging
schemes. A series of running examples from wireless resource allocation
illustrate the ideas and design tradeoffs.

 <dc:description>  Constraint &quot;at most one&quot; is a basic cardinality constraint which requires
that at most one of its $n$ boolean inputs is set to $1$. This constraint is
widely used when translating a problem into a conjunctive normal form (CNF) and
we investigate its CNF encodings suitable for this purpose. An encoding differs
from a CNF representation of a function in that it can use auxiliary variables.
We are especially interested in propagation complete encodings which have the
property that unit propagation is strong enough to enforce consistency on input
variables. We show a lower bound on the number of clauses in any propagation
complete encoding of the &quot;at most one&quot; constraint. The lower bound almost
matches the size of the best known encodings. We also study an important case
of 2-CNF encodings where we show a slightly better lower bound. The lower bound
holds also for a related &quot;exactly one&quot; constraint.

 <dc:description>  Color and intensity are two important components in an image. Usually, groups
of image pixels, which are similar in color or intensity, are an informative
representation for an object. They are therefore particularly suitable for
computer vision tasks, such as saliency detection and object proposal
generation. However, image pixels, which share a similar real-world color, may
be quite different since colors are often distorted by intensity. In this
paper, we reinvestigate the affinity matrices originally used in image
segmentation methods based on spectral clustering. A new affinity matrix, which
is robust to color distortions, is formulated for object discovery. Moreover, a
Cohesion Measurement (CM) for object regions is also derived based on the
formulated affinity matrix. Based on the new Cohesion Measurement, a novel
object discovery method is proposed to discover objects latent in an image by
utilizing the eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. Then we apply the proposed
method to both saliency detection and object proposal generation. Experimental
results on several evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CM based
method has achieved promising performance for these two tasks.

 <dc:description>  Beneath the uncertain primitive visual features of face images are the
primitive intrinsic structural patterns (PISP) essential for characterizing a
sample face discriminative attributes. It is on this basis that this paper
presents a simple yet effective facial descriptor formed from derivatives of
Gaussian and Gabor Wavelets. The new descriptor is coined local edge gradient
Gabor magnitude (LEGGM) pattern. LEGGM first uncovers the PISP locked in every
pixel through determining the pixel gradient in relation to its neighbors using
the Derivatives of Gaussians. Then, the resulting output is embedded into the
global appearance of the face which are further processed using Gabor wavelets
in order to express its frequency characteristics. Additionally, we adopted
various subspace models for dimensionality reduction in order to ascertain the
best fit model for reporting a more effective representation of the LEGGM
patterns. The proposed descriptor-based face recognition method is evaluated on
three databases: Plastic surgery, LFW, and GT face databases. Through
experiments, using a base classifier, the efficacy of the proposed method is
demonstrated, especially in the case of plastic surgery database. The
heterogeneous database, which we created to typify real-world scenario, show
that the proposed method is to an extent insensitive to image formation factors
with impressive recognition performances.

 <dc:description>  We propose a robust two-dimensional polynomial beamformer design method,
formulated as a convex optimization problem, which allows for flexible steering
of a previously proposed data-independent robust beamformer in both azimuth and
elevation direction.~As an exemplary application, the proposed two-dimensional
polynomial beamformer design is applied to a twelve-element microphone array,
integrated into the head of a humanoid robot. To account for the effects of the
robot's head on the sound field, measured head-related transfer functions are
integrated into the optimization problem as steering vectors. The
two-dimensional polynomial beamformer design is evaluated using
signal-independent and signal-dependent measures. The results confirm that the
proposed polynomial beamformer design approximates the original fixed
beamformer design very accurately, which makes it an attractive approach for
robust real-time data-independent beamforming.

 <dc:description>  The upcoming WebRTC-based browser-to-browser communication services present
new challenges for user discovery in peer-to-peer mode. Even more so, if we
wish to enable different web communication services to interact. This paper
presents Identity Mapping and Discovery Service (IMaDS), a global, scalable,
service independent discovery service that enables users of web-based
peer-to-peer applications to discover other users whom to communicate with. It
also provides reachability and presence information. For that, user identities
need to be mapped to any compatible service identity as well as to a globally
unique, service-independent identity. This mapping and discovery process is
suitable for multiple identifier formats and personal identifying properties,
but it supports user-determined privacy options. IMaDS operates across
different service domains dynamically, using context information. Users and
devices have profiles containing context and other specific information that
can be discovered by a search engine. The search results reveal the user's
allocated globally unique identifier (GUID), which is then resolved to a list
of the user's service domains identities, using a DHT-based directory service.
Service-specific directories allow tracking of active endpoints, where users
are currently logged on and can be contacted.

 <dc:description>  Ideally, by enabling multi-tenancy, network virtualization allows to improve
resource utilization, while providing performance isolation: although the
underlying resources are shared, the virtual network appears as a dedicated
network to the tenant. However, providing such an illusion is challenging in
practice, and over the last years, many expedient approaches have been proposed
to provide performance isolation in virtual networks, by enforcing bandwidth
reservations. We in this paper study another source for overheads and
unpredictable performance in virtual networks: the hypervisor.
  The hypervisor is a critical component in multi-tenant environments, but its
overhead and influence on performance are hardly understood today. In
particular, we focus on OpenFlow-based virtualized Software Defined Networks
(vSDNs). Network virtualization is considered a killer application for SDNs: a
vSDN allows each tenant to flexibly manage its network from a logically
centralized perspective, via a simple API. For the purpose of our study, we
developed a new benchmarking tool for OpenFlow control and data planes,
enabling high and consistent OpenFlow message rates. Using our tool, we
identify and measure controllable and uncontrollable effects on performance and
overhead, including the hypervisor technology, the number of tenants as well as
the tenant type, as well as the type of OpenFlow messages.

 <dc:description>  Neural word segmentation research has benefited from large-scale raw texts by
leveraging them for pretraining character and word embeddings. On the other
hand, statistical segmentation research has exploited richer sources of
external information, such as punctuation, automatic segmentation and POS. We
investigate the effectiveness of a range of external training sources for
neural word segmentation by building a modular segmentation model, pretraining
the most important submodule using rich external sources. Results show that
such pretraining significantly improves the model, leading to accuracies
competitive to the best methods on six benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Neural conversational models require substantial amounts of dialogue data for
their parameter estimation and are therefore usually learned on large corpora
such as chat forums or movie subtitles. These corpora are, however, often
challenging to work with, notably due to their frequent lack of turn
segmentation and the presence of multiple references external to the dialogue
itself. This paper shows that these challenges can be mitigated by adding a
weighting model into the architecture. The weighting model, which is itself
estimated from dialogue data, associates each training example to a numerical
weight that reflects its intrinsic quality for dialogue modelling. At training
time, these sample weights are included into the empirical loss to be
minimised. Evaluation results on retrieval-based models trained on movie and TV
subtitles demonstrate that the inclusion of such a weighting model improves the
model performance on unsupervised metrics.

 <dc:description>  Traditional power grids are being transformed into Smart Grids (SGs) to solve
the problems of uni-directional information flow, energy wastage, growing
energy demand, reliability and security. SGs offer bi-directional energy flow
between service providers and consumers, involving power generation,
transmission, distribution and utilization systems. SGs employ various devices
for the monitoring, analysis and control of the grid, deployed at power plants,
distribution centers and in consumers' premises in a very large number. Hence,
an SG requires connectivity, automation and the tracking of such devices. This
is achieved with the help of Internet of Things (IoT). IoT helps SG systems to
support various network functions throughout the generation, transmission,
distribution and consumption of energy by incorporating IoT devices (such as
sensors, actuators and smart meters), as well as by providing the connectivity,
automation and tracking for such devices. In this paper, we provide the first
comprehensive survey on IoT-aided SG systems, which includes the existing
architectures, applications and prototypes of IoT-aided SG systems. This survey
also highlights the open issues, challenges and future research directions for
IoT-aided SG systems.

 <dc:description>  Education and training in digital forensics requires a variety of suitable
challenge corpora containing realistic features including regular
wear-and-tear, background noise, and the actual digital traces to be discovered
during investigation. Typically, the creation of these challenges requires
overly arduous effort on the part of the educator to ensure their viability.
Once created, the challenge image needs to be stored and distributed to a class
for practical training. This storage and distribution step requires significant
time and resources and may not even be possible in an online/distance learning
scenario due to the data sizes involved. As part of this paper, we introduce a
more capable methodology and system as an alternative to current approaches.
EviPlant is a system designed for the efficient creation, manipulation, storage
and distribution of challenges for digital forensics education and training.
The system relies on the initial distribution of base disk images, i.e., images
containing solely base operating systems. In order to create challenges for
students, educators can boot the base system, emulate the desired activity and
perform a &quot;diffing&quot; of resultant image and the base image. This diffing process
extracts the modified artefacts and associated metadata and stores them in an
&quot;evidence package&quot;. Evidence packages can be created for different personae,
different wear-and-tear, different emulated crimes, etc., and multiple evidence
packages can be distributed to students and integrated into the base images. A
number of additional applications in digital forensic challenge creation for
tool testing and validation, proficiency testing, and malware analysis are also
discussed as a result of using EviPlant.

 <dc:description>  Recommendation plays a key role in e-commerce and in the entertainment
industry. We propose to consider successive recommendations to users under the
form of graphs of recommendations. We give models for this representation.
Motivated by the growing interest for algorithmic transparency, we then propose
a first application for those graphs, that is the potential detection of
introduced recommendation bias by the service provider. This application relies
on the analysis of the topology of the extracted graph for a given user; we
propose a notion of recommendation coherence with regards to the topological
proximity of recommended items (under the measure of items' k-closest
neighbors, reminding the &quot;small-world&quot; model by Watts &amp; Stroggatz). We finally
illustrate this approach on a model and on Youtube crawls, targeting the
prediction of &quot;Recommended for you&quot; links (i.e., biased or not by Youtube).

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce robust and synergetic hand-crafted features and a
simple but efficient deep feature from a convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture for defocus estimation. This paper systematically analyzes the
effectiveness of different features, and shows how each feature can compensate
for the weaknesses of other features when they are concatenated. For a full
defocus map estimation, we extract image patches on strong edges sparsely,
after which we use them for deep and hand-crafted feature extraction. In order
to reduce the degree of patch-scale dependency, we also propose a multi-scale
patch extraction strategy. A sparse defocus map is generated using a neural
network classifier followed by a probability-joint bilateral filter. The final
defocus map is obtained from the sparse defocus map with guidance from an
edge-preserving filtered input image. Experimental results show that our
algorithm is superior to state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of defocus
estimation. Our work can be used for applications such as segmentation, blur
magnification, all-in-focus image generation, and 3-D estimation.

 <dc:description>  To cope with the increasing variability and sophistication of modern attacks,
machine learning has been widely adopted as a statistically-sound tool for
malware detection. However, its security against well-crafted attacks has not
only been recently questioned, but it has been shown that machine learning
exhibits inherent vulnerabilities that can be exploited to evade detection at
test time. In other words, machine learning itself can be the weakest link in a
security system. In this paper, we rely upon a previously-proposed attack
framework to categorize potential attack scenarios against learning-based
malware detection tools, by modeling attackers with different skills and
capabilities. We then define and implement a set of corresponding evasion
attacks to thoroughly assess the security of Drebin, an Android malware
detector. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a simple and
scalable secure-learning paradigm that mitigates the impact of evasion attacks,
while only slightly worsening the detection rate in the absence of attack. We
finally argue that our secure-learning approach can also be readily applied to
other malware detection tasks.

these in models of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) network has
consumed considerable effort using special insights into the structure of
corresponding models. Here we apply combinations of symbolic computation
methods for mixed equality/inequality systems, specifically virtual
substitution, lazy real triangularization and cylindrical algebraic
decomposition. We determine multistationarity of an 11-dimensional MAPK network
when numeric values are known for all but potentially one parameter. More
precisely, our considered model has 11 equations in 11 variables and 19
parameters, 3 of which are of interest for symbolic treatment, and furthermore
positivity conditions on all variables and parameters.

 <dc:description>  Voltage control plays an important role in the operation of electricity
distribution networks, especially with high penetration of distributed energy
resources. These resources introduces significant and fast varying
uncertainties. In this paper, we focus on reactive power compensation to
control voltage in the presence of uncertainties. We adopt a probabilistic
approach that accounts for arbitrary correlations between renewable resources
at each of the buses and we use the linearized DistFlow equations to model the
distribution network. We then show that this optimization problem is convex for
a wide variety of probabilistic distributions. Compared to conventional per-bus
chance constraints, our formulation is more robust to uncertainty and more
computationally tractable. We illustrate the results using standard IEEE
distribution test feeders.

 <dc:description>  This is an intuitive introduction to classic sliding mode control that shows
how the associated assumptions and condition for its use arise in the context
of a derivation of the method. It derives a controller that obviates the need
for the assumption of any sign for the control input vector, answers why it is
said that it deals only with matched disturbances and why a system that it may
apply to 'must' be linear in the control signal. Additionally, it may be viewed
as an example of how a control design method might be developed, adding to its
pedagogical usefulness.

 <dc:description>  Agile Development is used for many problems, often with different priorities
and challenges. However, generalized engineering methodologies often overlook
the particularities of a project. To solve this problem, we have looked at ways
engineers have modified development methodologies for a particular focus, and
created a generalized framework for leveraging Kanban towards focused
improvements. The result is a parallel iterative board that tracks and
visualizes progress towards a focus, which we have applied to security,
sustainability, and high performance as examples. Through use of this system,
software projects can be more focused and directed towards their goals.

 <dc:title>Entropy of Independent Experiments, Revisited</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Skorski, Maciej</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The weak law of large numbers implies that, under mild assumptions on the
source, the Renyi entropy per produced symbol converges (in probability)
towards the Shannon entropy rate. This paper quantifies the speed of this
convergence for sources with independent (but not iid) outputs, generalizing
and improving the result of Holenstein and Renner (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory,
2011). (a) we characterize sources with \emph{slowest convergence} (for given
entropy): their outputs are mixtures of a uniform distribution and a unit mass.
(b) based on the above characterization, we establish faster convergences in
\emph{high-entropy} regimes.
  We discuss how these improved bounds may be used to better quantify security
of outputs of random number generators. In turn, the characterization of
&quot;worst&quot; distributions can be used to derive sharp &quot;extremal&quot; inequalities
between Renyi and Shannon entropy. The main technique is \emph{non-convex
programming}, used to characterize distributions of possibly large exponential
moments under certain entropy.

 <dc:description>  The contextual bandit literature has traditionally focused on algorithms that
address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In particular, greedy policies
that exploit current estimates without any exploration may be sub-optimal in
general. However, exploration-free greedy policies are desirable in many
practical settings where exploration may be prohibitively costly or unethical
(e.g. clinical trials). We prove that, for a general class of context
distributions, the greedy policy benefits from a natural exploration obtained
from the varying contexts and becomes asymptotically rate-optimal for the
two-armed contextual bandit. Through simulations, we also demonstrate that
these results generalize to more than two arms if the dimension of contexts is
large enough. Motivated by these results, we introduce Greedy-First, a new
algorithm that uses only observed contexts and rewards to determine whether to
follow a greedy policy or to explore. We prove that this algorithm is
asymptotically optimal without any additional assumptions on the distribution
of contexts or the number of arms. Extensive simulations demonstrate that
Greedy-First successfully reduces experimentation and outperforms existing
(exploration-based) contextual bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling,
UCB, or $\epsilon$-greedy.

 <dc:description>  In previous work two of the authors have shown that a vector $x \in
\mathbb{R}^n$ with at most $k &lt; n$ nonzeros can be recovered from an expander
sketch $Ax$ in $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{nnz}(A)\log k)$ operations via the
Parallel-$\ell_0$ decoding algorithm, where $\mathrm{nnz}(A)$ denotes the
number of nonzero entries in $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$. In this paper we
present the Robust-$\ell_0$ decoding algorithm, which robustifies
Parallel-$\ell_0$ when the sketch $Ax$ is corrupted by additive noise. This
robustness is achieved by approximating the asymptotic posterior distribution
of values in the sketch given its corrupted measurements. We provide analytic
expressions that approximate these posteriors under the assumptions that the
nonzero entries in the signal and the noise are drawn from continuous
distributions. Numerical experiments presented show that Robust-$\ell_0$ is
superior to existing greedy and combinatorial compressed sensing algorithms in
the presence of small to moderate signal-to-noise ratios in the setting of
Gaussian signals and Gaussian additive noise.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce and formalize Substochastic Monte Carlo (SSMC)
algorithms. These algorithms, originally intended to be a better classical foil
to quantum annealing than simulated annealing, prove to be worthy optimization
algorithms in their own right. In SSMC, a population of walkers is initialized
according to a known distribution on an arbitrary search space and varied into
the solution of some optimization problem of interest. The first argument of
this paper shows how an existing classical algorithm, &quot;Go-With-The-Winners&quot;
(GWW), is a limiting case of SSMC when restricted to binary search and
particular driving dynamics.
  Although limiting to GWW, SSMC is more general. We show that (1) GWW can be
efficiently simulated within the SSMC framework, (2) SSMC can be exponentially
faster than GWW, (3) by naturally incorporating structural information, SSMC
can exponentially outperform the quantum algorithm that first inspired it, and
(4) SSMC exhibits desirable search features in general spaces. Our approach
combines ideas from genetic algorithms (GWW), theoretical probability
(Fleming-Viot processes), and quantum computing. Not only do we demonstrate
that SSMC is often more efficient than competing algorithms, but we also hope
that our results connecting these disciplines will impact each independently.
An implemented version of SSMC has previously enjoyed some success as a
competitive optimization algorithm for Max-$k$-SAT.

 <dc:description>  A type system combining type application, constants as types, union types
(associative, commutative and idempotent) and recursive types has recently been
proposed for statically typing path polymorphism, the ability to define
functions that can operate uniformly over recursively specified applicative
data structures. A typical pattern such functions resort to is $x\,y$ which
decomposes a compound, in other words any applicative tree structure, into its
parts. We study type-checking for this type system in two stages. First we
propose algorithms for checking type equivalence and subtyping based on
coinductive characterizations of those relations. We then formulate a
syntax-directed presentation and prove its equivalence with the original one.
This yields a type-checking algorithm which unfortunately has exponential time
complexity in the worst case. A second algorithm is then proposed, based on
automata techniques, which yields a polynomial-time type-checking algorithm.

 <dc:description>  The literature on bandit learning and regret analysis has focused on contexts
where the goal is to converge on an optimal action in a manner that limits
exploration costs. One shortcoming imposed by this orientation is that it does
not treat time preference in a coherent manner. Time preference plays an
important role when the optimal action is costly to learn relative to
near-optimal actions. This limitation has not only restricted the relevance of
theoretical results but has also influenced the design of algorithms. Indeed,
popular approaches such as Thompson sampling and UCB can fare poorly in such
situations. In this paper, we consider discounted rather than cumulative
regret, where a discount factor encodes time preference. We propose satisficing
Thompson sampling -- a variation of Thompson sampling -- and establish a strong
discounted regret bound for this new algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Video analytics requires operating with large amounts of data. Compressive
sensing allows to reduce the number of measurements required to represent the
video using the prior knowledge of sparsity of the original signal, but it
imposes certain conditions on the design matrix. The Bayesian compressive
sensing approach relaxes the limitations of the conventional approach using the
probabilistic reasoning and allows to include different prior knowledge about
the signal structure. This paper presents two Bayesian compressive sensing
methods for autonomous object detection in a video sequence from a static
camera. Their performance is compared on the real datasets with the
non-Bayesian greedy algorithm. It is shown that the Bayesian methods can
provide the same accuracy as the greedy algorithm but much faster; or if the
computational time is not critical they can provide more accurate results.

 <dc:description>  In this study we map out the large-scale structure of citation networks of
science journals and follow their evolution in time by using stochastic block
models (SBMs). The SBM fitting procedures are principled methods that can be
used to find hierarchical grouping of journals into blocks that show similar
incoming and outgoing citations patterns. These methods work directly on the
citation network without the need to construct auxiliary networks based on
similarity of nodes. We fit the SBMs to the networks of journals we have
constructed from the data set of around 630 million citations and find a
variety of different types of blocks, such as clusters, bridges, sources, and
sinks. In addition we use a recent generalization of SBMs to determine how much
a manually curated classification of journals into subfields of science is
related to the block structure of the journal network and how this relationship
changes in time. The SBM method tries to find a network of blocks that is the
best high-level representation of the network of journals, and we illustrate
how these block networks (at various levels of resolution) can be used as maps
of science.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we aim to monitor the flow of people in large public
infrastructures. We propose an unsupervised methodology to cluster people flow
patterns into the most typical and meaningful configurations. By processing 3D
images from a network of depth cameras, we built a descriptor for the flow
pattern. We define a data-irregularity measure that assesses how well each
descriptor fits a data model. This allows us to rank the flow patterns from
highly distinctive (outliers) to very common ones and, discarding outliers,
obtain more reliable key configurations (classes). We applied this methodology
in an operational scenario during 18 days in the X-ray screening area of an
international airport. Results show that our methodology is able to summarize
the representative patterns, a relevant information for airport management.
Beyond regular flows our method identifies a set of rare events corresponding
to uncommon activities (cleaning,special security and circulating staff). We
demonstrate that for such a long observation period our methodology
encapsulates the relevant &quot;states&quot; of the infrastructure in a very compact way.

 <dc:description>  To mitigate the uncertainty of variable renewable resources, two
off-the-shelf machine learning tools are deployed to forecast the solar power
output of a solar photovoltaic system. The support vector machines generate the
forecasts and the random forest acts as an ensemble learning method to combine
the forecasts. The common ensemble technique in wind and solar power
forecasting is the blending of meteorological data from several sources. In
this study though, the present and the past solar power forecasts from several
models, as well as the associated meteorological data, are incorporated into
the random forest to combine and improve the accuracy of the day-ahead solar
power forecasts. The performance of the combined model is evaluated over the
entire year and compared with other combining techniques.

 <dc:description>  Non-cosmic, non-Gaussian disturbances known as &quot;glitches&quot;, show up in
gravitational-wave data of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave
Observatory, or aLIGO. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-view
convolutional neural network to classify glitches automatically. The primary
purpose of classifying glitches is to understand their characteristics and
origin, which facilitates their removal from the data or from the detector
entirely. We visualize glitches as spectrograms and leverage the
state-of-the-art image classification techniques in our model. The suggested
classifier is a multi-view deep neural network that exploits four different
views for classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed model improves the overall accuracy of the classification compared to
traditional single view algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the problem of sentence-level supporting argument detection
from relevant documents for user-specified claims. A dataset containing claims
and associated citation articles is collected from online debate website
idebate.org. We then manually label sentence-level supporting arguments from
the documents along with their types as study, factual, opinion, or reasoning.
We further characterize arguments of different types, and explore whether
leveraging type information can facilitate the supporting arguments detection
task. Experimental results show that LambdaMART (Burges, 2010) ranker that uses
features informed by argument types yields better performance than the same
ranker trained without type information.

 <dc:description>  Kiwi is a minimalist and extendable Constraint Programming (CP) solver
specifically designed for education. The particularities of Kiwi stand in its
generic trailing state restoration mechanism and its modulable use of
variables. By developing Kiwi, the author does not aim to provide an
alternative to full featured constraint solvers but rather to provide readers
with a basic architecture that will (hopefully) help them to understand the
core mechanisms hidden under the hood of constraint solvers, to develop their
own extended constraint solver, or to test innovative ideas.

 <dc:description>  Current approaches in video forecasting attempt to generate videos directly
in pixel space using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs). However, since these approaches try to model all the
structure and scene dynamics at once, in unconstrained settings they often
generate uninterpretable results. Our insight is to model the forecasting
problem at a higher level of abstraction. Specifically, we exploit human pose
detectors as a free source of supervision and break the video forecasting
problem into two discrete steps. First we explicitly model the high level
structure of active objects in the scene---humans---and use a VAE to model the
possible future movements of humans in the pose space. We then use the future
poses generated as conditional information to a GAN to predict the future
frames of the video in pixel space. By using the structured space of pose as an
intermediate representation, we sidestep the problems that GANs have in
generating video pixels directly. We show through quantitative and qualitative
evaluation that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for video
prediction.

 <dc:description>  Modern computer networks support interesting new routing models in which
traffic flows from a source s to a destination t can be flexibly steered
through a sequence of waypoints, such as (hardware) middleboxes or
(virtualized) network functions, to create innovative network services like
service chains or segment routing. While the benefits and technological
challenges of providing such routing models have been articulated and studied
intensively over the last years, much less is known about the underlying
algorithmic traffic routing problems. This paper shows that the waypoint
routing problem features a deep combinatorial structure, and we establish
interesting connections to several classic graph theoretical problems. We find
that the difficulty of the waypoint routing problem depends on the specific
setting, and chart a comprehensive landscape of the computational complexity.
In particular, we derive several NP-hardness results, but we also demonstrate
that exact polynomial-time algorithms exist for a wide range of practically
relevant scenarios.

 <dc:title>Stability analysis and stabilization of LPV systems with jumps and

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) systems with jumps and piecewise
differentiable parameters is a class of hybrid LPV systems for which no
tailored stability analysis and stabilization conditions have been obtained so
far. We fill this gap here by proposing an approach relying on the
reformulation of the considered LPV system as an extended equivalent hybrid
system that will incorporate, through a suitable state augmentation,
information on both the dynamics of the state of the system and the considered
class of parameter trajectories. Two stability conditions are established using
a result pertaining on the stability of hybrid systems and shown to naturally
generalize and unify the well-known quadratic and robust stability criteria
together. The obtained conditions being \blue{infinite-dimensional semidefinite
programming problems}, a relaxation approach based on sum of squares
programming is used in order to obtain tractable finite-dimensional conditions.
The conditions are then losslessly extended to solve two control problems,
namely, the stabilization by continuous and sampled-data gain-scheduled
state-feedback controllers. The approach is finally illustrated on several
examples from the literature

 <dc:description>  Recent developments in quaternion-valued widely linear processing have
illustrated that the exploitation of complete second-order statistics requires
consideration of both the covariance and complementary covariance matrices.
Such matrices have a tremendous amount of structure, and their decomposition is
a powerful tool in a variety of applications, however, this has proven rather
difficult, owing to the non-commutative nature of the quaternion product. To
this end, we introduce novel techniques for a simultaneous decomposition of the
covariance and complementary covariance matrices in the quaternion domain,
whereby the quaternion version of the Takagi factorisation is explored to
diagonalise symmetric quaternion-valued matrices. This gives new insight into
the quaternion uncorrelating transform (QUT) and forms a basis for the proposed
quaternion approximate uncorrelating transform (QAUT) which simultaneously
diagonalises all four covariance matrices associated with improper quaternion
signals. The effectiveness of the proposed uncorrelating transforms is
validated by simulations on synthetic and real-world quaternion-valued signals.

 <dc:description>  Research, especially in the social sciences and humanities, is increasingly
reliant on the application of data science methods to analyze large amounts of
(often private) data. Secure data enclaves provide a solution for managing and
analyzing private data. However, such enclaves do not readily support discovery
science---a form of exploratory or interactive analysis by which researchers
execute a range of (sometimes large) analyses in an iterative and collaborative
manner. The batch computing model offered by many data enclaves is well suited
to executing large compute tasks; however it is far from ideal for day-to-day
discovery science. As researchers must submit jobs to queues and wait for
results, the high latencies inherent in queue-based, batch computing systems
hinder interactive analysis. In this paper we describe how we have augmented
the Cloud Kotta secure data enclave to support collaborative and interactive
analysis of sensitive data. Our model uses Jupyter notebooks as a flexible
analysis environment and Python language constructs to support the execution of
arbitrary functions on private data within this secure framework.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an effective approach for the scaling registration of
$m$-D point sets. Different from the rigid transformation, the scaling
registration can not be formulated into the common least square function due to
the ill-posed problem caused by the scale factor. Therefore, this paper designs
a novel objective function for the scaling registration problem. The appearance
of this objective function is a rational fraction, where the numerator item is
the least square error and the denominator item is the square of the scale
factor. By imposing the emphasis on scale factor, the ill-posed problem can be
avoided in the scaling registration. Subsequently, the new objective function
can be solved by the proposed scaling iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm,
which can obtain the optimal scaling transformation. For the practical
applications, the scaling ICP algorithm is further extended to align partially
overlapping point sets. Finally, the proposed approach is tested on public data
sets and applied to merging grid maps of different resolutions. Experimental
results demonstrate its superiority over previous approaches on efficiency and
robustness.

 <dc:description>  Path planning for autonomous vehicles in arbitrary environments requires a
guarantee of safety, but this can be impractical to ensure in real-time when
the vehicle is described with a high-fidelity model. To address this problem,
this paper develops a method to perform trajectory design by considering a
low-fidelity model that accounts for model mismatch. The presented method
begins by computing a conservative Forward Reachable Set (FRS) of a
high-fidelity model's trajectories produced when tracking trajectories of a
low-fidelity model over a finite time horizon. At runtime, the vehicle
intersects this FRS with obstacles in the environment to eliminate trajectories
that can lead to a collision, then selects an optimal plan from the remaining
safe set. By bounding the time for this set intersection and subsequent path
selection, this paper proves a lower bound for the FRS time horizon and sensing
horizon to guarantee safety. This method is demonstrated in simulation using a
kinematic Dubin's car as the low-fidelity model and a dynamic unicycle as the
high-fidelity model.

 <dc:description>  This paper explores the Coevolutionary Optional Prisoner's Dilemma (COPD)
game, which is a simple model to coevolve game strategy and link weights of
agents playing the Optional Prisoner's Dilemma game. We consider a population
of agents placed in a lattice grid with boundary conditions. A number of Monte
Carlo simulations are performed to investigate the impacts of the COPD game on
the emergence of cooperation. Results show that the coevolutionary rules enable
cooperators to survive and even dominate, with the presence of abstainers in
the population playing a key role in the protection of cooperators against
exploitation from defectors. We observe that in adverse conditions such as when
the initial population of abstainers is too scarce/abundant, or when the
temptation to defect is very high, cooperation has no chance of emerging.
However, when the simple coevolutionary rules are applied, cooperators
flourish.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present two flavors of a quantum extension to the lambda
calculus. The first one, $\lambda_\rho$, follows the approach of classical
control/quantum data, where the quantum data is represented by density
matrices. We provide an interpretation for programs as density matrices and
functions upon them. The second one, $\lambda_\rho^\circ$, take advantage of
the density matrices presentation in order to follow the mixed trace of
programs in a kind of generalised density matrix. Such a control can be seen as
a weaker form of the quantum control and data approach.

 <dc:description>  A class of xorshift random number generators (RNGs) are introduced by
Marsaglia. We have proposed an algorithm which constructs a full period
xorshift RNG from a given primitive polynomial. It is shown there is a weakness
present in those RNGs and is suggested its improvement. A separate algorithm is
also proposed which returns a full period xorshift generator with desired
number of xorshift operations.%We also introduce the notion of tweaked
primitive multiple-recursive matrix method with improved linear complexity.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel ranking framework for collaborative
filtering with the overall aim of learning user preferences over items by
minimizing a pairwise ranking loss. We show the minimization problem involves
dependent random variables and provide a theoretical analysis by proving the
consistency of the empirical risk minimization in the worst case where all
users choose a minimal number of positive and negative items. We further derive
a Neural-Network model that jointly learns a new representation of users and
items in an embedded space as well as the preference relation of users over the
pairs of items. The learning objective is based on three scenarios of ranking
losses that control the ability of the model to maintain the ordering over the
items induced from the users' preferences, as well as, the capacity of the
dot-product defined in the learned embedded space to produce the ordering. The
proposed model is by nature suitable for implicit feedback and involves the
estimation of only very few parameters. Through extensive experiments on
several real-world benchmarks on implicit data, we show the interest of
learning the preference and the embedding simultaneously when compared to
learning those separately. We also demonstrate that our approach is very
competitive with the best state-of-the-art collaborative filtering techniques
proposed for implicit feedback.

 <dc:description>  We study automatic question generation for sentences from text passages in
reading comprehension. We introduce an attention-based sequence learning model
for the task and investigate the effect of encoding sentence- vs.
paragraph-level information. In contrast to all previous work, our model does
not rely on hand-crafted rules or a sophisticated NLP pipeline; it is instead
trainable end-to-end via sequence-to-sequence learning. Automatic evaluation
results show that our system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
rule-based system. In human evaluations, questions generated by our system are
also rated as being more natural (i.e., grammaticality, fluency) and as more
difficult to answer (in terms of syntactic and lexical divergence from the
original text and reasoning needed to answer).

 <dc:title>The Social Benefits of Balancing Creativity and Imitation: Evidence from

 <dc:description>  Although creativity is encouraged in the abstract it is often discouraged in
educational and workplace settings. Using an agent-based model of cultural
evolution, we investigated the idea that tempering the novelty-generating
effects of creativity with the novelty-preserving effects of imitation is
beneficial for society. In Experiment One we systematically introduced
individual differences in creativity, and observed a trade-off between the
ratio of creators to imitators, and how creative the creators were. Excess
creativity was detrimental because creators invested in unproven ideas at the
expense of propagating proven ones. Experiment Two tested the hypothesis that
society as a whole benefits if individuals adjust how creative they are in
accordance with their creative success. When effective creators created more,
and ineffective creators created less (social regulation), the agents
segregated into creators and imitators, and the mean fitness of outputs was
temporarily higher. We hypothesized that the temporary nature of the effect was
due to a ceiling on output fitness. In Experiment Three we made the space of
possible outputs open-ended by giving agents the capacity to chain simple
outputs into arbitrarily complex ones such that fitter outputs were always
possible. With the capacity for chained outputs, the effect of social
regulation could indeed be maintained indefinitely. The results are discussed
in light of empirical data.

 <dc:description>  Pre-trained word embeddings learned from unlabeled text have become a
standard component of neural network architectures for NLP tasks. However, in
most cases, the recurrent network that operates on word-level representations
to produce context sensitive representations is trained on relatively little
labeled data. In this paper, we demonstrate a general semi-supervised approach
for adding pre- trained context embeddings from bidirectional language models
to NLP systems and apply it to sequence labeling tasks. We evaluate our model
on two standard datasets for named entity recognition (NER) and chunking, and
in both cases achieve state of the art results, surpassing previous systems
that use other forms of transfer or joint learning with additional labeled data
and task specific gazetteers.

 <dc:description>  The future 5G wireless infrastructure will support any-to-any connectivity
between densely deployed smart objects that form the emerging paradigm known as
the Internet of Everything (IoE). Compared to traditional wireless networks
that enable communication between devices using a single technology, 5G
networks will need to support seamless connectivity between heterogeneous
wireless objects and IoE networks. To tackle the complexity and versatility of
future IoE networks, 5G will need to guarantee optimal usage of both spectrum
and energy resources and further support technology-agnostic connectivity
between objects. One way to realize this is to combine intelligent network
control with adaptive software defined air interfaces. In this paper, a
flexible and compact platform is proposed for on-the-fly composition of
low-power adaptive air interfaces, based on hardware/software co-processing.
Compared to traditional Software Defined Radio (SDR) systems that perform
computationally-intensive signal processing algorithms in software, consume
significantly power and have a large form factor, the proposed platform uses
modern hybrid FPGA technology combined with novel ideas such as RF
Network-on-Chip (RFNoC) and partial reconfiguration. The resulting system
enables composition of reconfigurable air interfaces based on hardware/software
co-processing on a single chip, allowing high processing throughput, at a
smaller form factor and reduced power consumption.

 <dc:description>  Multiple-antenna systems is a key technique to serve multiple users in future
wireless systems. For low energy consumption and hardware complexity we first
consider transmit symbols with constant magnitude and then 1-bit
digital-to-analog converters. We propose precoding designs which maximize the
minimum distance to the decision threshold at the receiver. The precoding
design with 1-bit DAC corresponds to a discrete optimization problem, which we
solve exactly with a branch-and-bound strategy. We alternatively present an
approximation based on relaxation. Our results show that the proposed
branch-and-bound approach has polynomial complexity. The proposed methods
outperform existing precoding methods with 1-bit DAC in terms of uncoded bit
error rate and sum-rate. The performance loss in comparison to infinite DAC
resolution is small.

 <dc:description>  We discuss several modifications and extensions over the previous proposed
Cnvlutin (CNV) accelerator for convolutional and fully-connected layers of Deep
Learning Network. We first describe different encodings of the activations that
are deemed ineffectual. The encodings have different memory overhead and energy
characteristics. We propose using a level of indirection when accessing
activations from memory to reduce their memory footprint by storing only the
effectual activations. We also present a modified organization that detects the
activations that are deemed as ineffectual while fetching them from memory.
This is different than the original design that instead detected them at the
output of the preceding layer. Finally, we present an extended CNV that can
also skip ineffectual weights.

on &quot;real-world&quot; instances than in the worst case are greedy algorithms and
local search algorithms. In this paper, we systematically study these two types
of algorithms for the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular set function
subject to downward-closed feasibility constraints. We consider
perturbation-stable instances, in the sense of Bilu and Linial, and precisely
identify the stability threshold beyond which these algorithms are guaranteed
to recover the optimal solution. Byproducts of our work include the first
definition of perturbation-stability for non-additive objective functions, and
a resolution of the worst-case approximation guarantee of local search in
p-extendible systems.

 <dc:description>  In most of modern enterprise systems, redundancy configuration is often
considered to provide availability during the part of such systems is being
patched. However, the redundancy may increase the attack surface of the system.
In this paper, we model and assess the security and capacity oriented
availability of multiple server redundancy designs when applying security
patches to the servers. We construct (1) a graphical security model to evaluate
the security under potential attacks before and after applying patches, (2) a
stochastic reward net model to assess the capacity oriented availability of the
system with a patch schedule. We present our approach based on case study and
model-based evaluation for multiple design choices. The results show redundancy
designs increase capacity oriented availability but decrease security when
applying security patches. We define functions that compare values of security
metrics and capacity oriented availability with the chosen upper/lower bounds
to find design choices that satisfy both security and availability
requirements.

competing against k-shifting experts. We give a series of algorithms for this

further present efficient algorithms based on an approximation of the
competitor automaton, in particular n-gram models obtained by minimizing the

approximation properties of such models. Finally, we also extend our algorithms
and results to the framework of sleeping experts.

 <dc:description>  Recent developments in formal verification have identified approximate
liftings (also known as approximate couplings) as a clean, compositional
abstraction for proving differential privacy. There are two styles of
definitions for this construction. Earlier definitions require the existence of
one or more witness distributions, while a recent definition by Sato uses
universal quantification over all sets of samples. These notions have different
strengths and weaknesses: the universal version is more general than the
existential ones, but the existential versions enjoy more precise composition
principles.
  We propose a novel, existential version of approximate lifting, called
*-lifting, and show that it is equivalent to Sato's construction for discrete
probability measures. Our work unifies all known notions of approximate
lifting, giving cleaner properties, more general constructions, and more
precise composition theorems for both styles of lifting, enabling richer proofs
of differential privacy. We also clarify the relation between existing
definitions of approximate lifting, and generalize our constructions to
approximate liftings based on f-divergences.

 <dc:description>  Embedded real-time systems (RTS) are pervasive. Many modern RTS are exposed
to unknown security flaws, and threats to RTS are growing in both number and
sophistication. However, until recently, cyber-security considerations were an
afterthought in the design of such systems. Any security mechanisms integrated
into RTS must (a) co-exist with the real- time tasks in the system and (b)
operate without impacting the timing and safety constraints of the control
logic. We introduce Contego, an approach to integrating security tasks into RTS
without affecting temporal requirements. Contego is specifically designed for
legacy systems, viz., the real-time control systems in which major alterations
of the system parameters for constituent tasks is not always feasible. Contego
combines the concept of opportunistic execution with hierarchical scheduling to
maintain compatibility with legacy systems while still providing flexibility by
allowing security tasks to operate in different modes. We also define a metric
to measure the effectiveness of such integration. We evaluate Contego using
synthetic workloads as well as with an implementation on a realistic embedded
platform (an open- source ARM CPU running real-time Linux).

 <dc:description>  Homomorphic encryption is an encryption scheme that allows computations to be
evaluated on encrypted inputs without knowledge of their raw messages. Recently
Ouyang et al. constructed a quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) scheme for
Clifford circuits with statistical security (or information-theoretic security
(IT-security)). It is desired to see whether an information-
theoretically-secure (ITS) quantum FHE exists. If not, what other nontrivial
class of quantum circuits can be homomorphically evaluated with IT-security? We
provide a limitation for the first question that an ITS quantum FHE necessarily
incurs exponential overhead. As for the second one, we propose two QHE schemes
for an enlarged class of the instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP)
circuits called IQP + . The first scheme TRIV follows directly from the
one-time pad. The second scheme IQPP is constructed from a class of
concatenated quantum stabilizer codes, whose logical X and Z operators act
nontrivially on different sets of qubits

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study arithmetic computations in the nonassociative, and
noncommutative free polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\}$. Prior
to this work, nonassociative arithmetic computation was considered by Hrubes,
Wigderson, and Yehudayoff [HWY10], and they showed lower bounds and proved
completeness results. We consider Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) and
polynomial factorization over $\mathbb{F}\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\}$ and show the
following results. (1) Given an arithmetic circuit $C$ of size $s$ computing a
polynomial $f\in \mathbb{F} \{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\}$ of degree $d$, we give a
deterministic $poly(n,s,d)$ algorithm to decide if $f$ is identically zero
polynomial or not. Our result is obtained by a suitable adaptation of the PIT
algorithm of Raz-Shpilka [RS05] for noncommutative ABPs. (2) Given an
arithmetic circuit $C$ of size $s$ computing a polynomial $f\in \mathbb{F}
\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\}$ of degree $d$, we give an efficient deterministic
algorithm to compute circuits for the irreducible factors of $f$ in time
$poly(n,s,d)$ when $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{Q}$. Over finite fields of
characteristic $p$, our algorithm runs in time $poly(n,s,d,p)$.

 <dc:description>  Time-domain chromatic dispersion (CD) equalization using finite impulse
response (FIR) filter is now a common approach for coherent optical fiber
communication systems. The complex weights of FIR filter taps are calculated
from a truncated impulse response of the CD transfer function, and the modulus
of the complex weights is constant. In our work, we take the limited bandwidth
of a single channel signal into account and propose weighted FIR filters to
improve the performance of CD equalization. A raised cosine FIR filter and a
Gaussian FIR filter are investigated in our work. The optimization of raised
cosine FIR filter and Gaussian FIR filter are made in terms of the EVM of QPSK,
16QAM and 32QAM coherent detection signal. The results demonstrate that the
optimized parameters of the weighted filters are independent of the modulation
format, symbol rate and the length of transmission fiber. With the optimized
weighted FIR filters, the EVM of CD equalization signal is decreased
significantly. The principle of weighted FIR filter can also be extended to
other symmetric functions as weighted functions.

 <dc:description>  We consider the replica placement problem: given a graph with clients and
nodes, place replicas on a minimum set of nodes to serve all the clients; each
client is associated with a request and maximum distance that it can travel to
get served and there is a maximum limit (capacity) on the amount of request a
replica can serve. The problem falls under the general framework of capacitated
set covering. It admits an O(\log n)-approximation and it is NP-hard to
approximate within a factor of $o(\log n)$. We study the problem in terms of
the treewidth $t$ of the graph and present an O(t)-approximation algorithm.

 <dc:title>Classical Planning in Deep Latent Space: Bridging the

 <dc:creator>Asai, Masataro</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Current domain-independent, classical planners require symbolic models of the
problem domain and instance as input, resulting in a knowledge acquisition
bottleneck. Meanwhile, although deep learning has achieved significant success
in many fields, the knowledge is encoded in a subsymbolic representation which
is incompatible with symbolic systems such as planners. We propose LatPlan, an
unsupervised architecture combining deep learning and classical planning. Given
only an unlabeled set of image pairs showing a subset of transitions allowed in
the environment (training inputs), and a pair of images representing the
initial and the goal states (planning inputs), LatPlan finds a plan to the goal
state in a symbolic latent space and returns a visualized plan execution. The
contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) State Autoencoder, which finds a
propositional state representation of the environment using a Variational
Autoencoder. It generates a discrete latent vector from the images, based on
which a PDDL model can be constructed and then solved by an off-the-shelf
planner. (2) Action Autoencoder / Discriminator, a neural architecture which
jointly finds the action symbols and the implicit action models
(preconditions/effects), and provides a successor function for the implicit
graph search. We evaluate LatPlan using image-based versions of 3 planning
domains: 8-puzzle, Towers of Hanoi and LightsOut.

 <dc:description>  Hysteresis is a highly nonlinear phenomenon, showing up in a wide variety of
science and engineering problems. The identification of hysteretic systems from
input-output data is a challenging task. Recent work on black-box polynomial
nonlinear state-space modeling for hysteresis identification has provided
promising results, but struggles with a large number of parameters due to the
use of multivariate polynomials. This drawback is tackled in the current paper
by applying a decoupling approach that results in a more parsimonious
representation involving univariate polynomials. This work is carried out
numerically on input-output data generated by a Bouc-Wen hysteretic model and
follows up on earlier work of the authors. The current article discusses the
polynomial decoupling approach and explores the selection of the number of
univariate polynomials with the polynomial degree, as well as the connections
with neural network modeling. We have found that the presented decoupling
approach is able to reduce the number of parameters of the full nonlinear model
up to about 50\%, while maintaining a comparable output error level.

 <dc:title>Cyclic Hypergraph Degree Sequences</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Meesum, Syed Mohammad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of efficiently characterizing degree sequences of simple
hypergraphs is a fundamental long-standing open problem in Graph Theory.
Several results are known for restricted versions of this problem. This paper
adds to the list of sufficient conditions for a degree sequence to be {\em
hypergraphic}. This paper proves a combinatorial lemma about cyclically
permuting the columns of a binary table with length $n$ binary sequences as
rows. We prove that for any set of cyclic permutations acting on its columns,
the resulting table has all of its $2^n$ rows distinct. Using this property, we
first define a subset {\em cyclic hyper degrees} of hypergraphic sequences and
show that they admit a polynomial time recognition algorithm. Next, we prove
that there are at least $2^{\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}}$ {\em cyclic hyper degrees},
which also serves as a lower bound on the number of {\em hypergraphic}
sequences. The {\em cyclic hyper degrees} also enjoy a structural
characterization, they are the integral points contained in the union of some
$n$-dimensional rectangles.

 <dc:description>  One of the key concepts in the research on political attitudes is attitude
strength. Strong attitudes are durable and impactful, while weak attitudes are
fluctuating and inconsequential. Recently, the Causal Attitude Network (CAN)
model was proposed as a comprehensive measurement model of attitudes. In this
model, attitudes are conceptualized as networks of causally connected
evaluative reactions (i.e., beliefs, feelings, and behavior toward an attitude
object). Here, we test the central postulate of the CAN model that strong
attitudes correspond to highly connected attitude networks. We use data from
the American National Election Studies 1980-2012 on attitudes toward
presidential candidates (total n = 18,795). The results show that attitude
strength and connectivity of attitude networks are strongly related. Additional
analyses show that connections between non-behavioral evaluative reactions
(i.e., beliefs and feelings toward presidential candidates) are highly
predictive of the connections between behavior (i.e., voting decisions) and
non-behavioral evaluative reactions. This result indicates that connectivity of
political attitude networks accounts for differences between strong and weak
attitudes in attitude-behavior consistency with respect to voting decisions. We
conclude that network theory provides a promising framework to advance the
understanding of attitude strength.

 <dc:description>  Curiosity is the strong desire to learn or know more about something or
someone. Since learning is often a social endeavor, social dynamics in
collaborative learning may inevitably influence curiosity. There is a scarcity
of research, however, focusing on how curiosity can be evoked in group learning
contexts. Inspired by a recently proposed theoretical framework that
articulates an integrated socio-cognitive infrastructure of curiosity, in this
work, we use data-driven approaches to identify fine-grained social scaffolding
of curiosity in child-child interaction, and propose how they can be used to
elicit and maintain curiosity in technology-enhanced learning environments. For
example, we discovered sequential patterns of multimodal behaviors across group
members and we describe those that maximize an individual's utility, or
likelihood, of demonstrating curiosity during open-ended problem-solving in
group work. We also discovered, and describe here, behaviors that directly or
in a mediated manner cause curiosity related conversational behaviors in the
interaction, with twice as many interpersonal causal influences compared to
intrapersonal ones. We explain how these findings form a solid foundation for
developing curiosity-increasing learning technologies or even assisting a human
coach to induce curiosity among learners.

 <dc:title>A Partitioning Algorithm for Detecting Eventuality Coincidence in
  Temporal Double recurrence</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A logical theory of regular double or multiple recurrence of eventualities,
which are regular patterns of occurrences that are repeated, in time, has been
developed within the context of temporal reasoning that enabled reasoning about
the problem of coincidence. i.e. if two complex eventualities, or eventuality
sequences consisting respectively of component eventualities x0, x1,....,xr and
y0, y1, ..,ys both recur over an interval k and all eventualities are of fixed
durations, is there a subinterval of k over which the occurrence xp and yq for
p between 1 and r and q between 1 and s coincide. We present the ideas behind a
new algorithm for detecting the coincidence of eventualities xp and yq within a
cycle of the double recurrence of x and y. The algorithm is based on the novel
concept of gcd partitions that requires the partitioning of each of the
incidences of both x and y into eventuality sequences each of which components
have a duration that is equal to the greatest common divisor of the durations
of x and y. The worst case running time of the partitioning algorithm is linear
in the maximum of the duration of x and that of y, while the worst case running
time of an algorithm exploring a complete cycle is quadratic in the durations
of x and y. Hence the partitioning algorithm works faster than the cyclical
exploration in the worst case.

 <dc:description>  This work presents an unsupervised approach for improving WordNet that builds
upon recent advances in document and sense representation via distributional
semantics. We apply our methods to construct Wordnets in French and Russian,
languages which both lack good manual constructions.1 These are evaluated on
two new 600-word test sets for word-to-synset matching and found to improve
greatly upon synset recall, outperforming the best automated Wordnets in
F-score. Our methods require very few linguistic resources, thus being
applicable for Wordnet construction in low-resources languages, and may further
be applied to sense clustering and other Wordnet improvements.

 <dc:description>  Floating point division, even though being an infrequent operation in the
traditional sense, is indis- pensable when it comes to a range of
non-traditional applications such as K-Means Clustering and QR Decomposition
just to name a few. In such applications, hardware support for floating point
division would boost the performance of the entire system. In this paper, we
present a novel architecture for a floating point division unit based on the
Taylor-series expansion algorithm. We show that the Iterative Logarithmic
Multiplier is very well suited to be used as a part of this architecture. We
propose an implementation of the powering unit that can calculate an odd power
and an even power of a number simultaneously, meanwhile having little hardware
overhead when compared to the Iterative Logarithmic Multiplier.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the setting where features are added or change
interpretation over time, which has applications in multiple domains such as
retail, manufacturing, finance. In particular, we propose an approach to
provably determine the time instant from which the new/changed features start
becoming relevant with respect to an output variable in an agnostic
(supervised) learning setting. We also suggest an efficient version of our
approach which has the same asymptotic performance. Moreover, our theory also
applies when we have more than one such change point. Independent post analysis
of a change point identified by our method for a large retailer revealed that
it corresponded in time with certain unflattering news stories about a brand
that resulted in the change in customer behavior. We also applied our method to
data from an advanced manufacturing plant identifying the time instant from
which downstream features became relevant. To the best of our knowledge this is
the first work that formally studies change point detection in a distribution
independent agnostic setting, where the change point is based on the changing
relationship between input and output.

 <dc:description>  This work presents a fully-programmable Internet of Things (IoT) visual
sensing node that targets sub-mW power consumption in always-on monitoring
scenarios. The system features a spatial-contrast $128\mathrm{x}64$ binary
pixel imager with focal-plane processing. The sensor, when working at its
lowest power mode ($10\mu W$ at 10 fps), provides as output the number of
changed pixels. Based on this information, a dedicated camera interface,
implemented on a low-power FPGA, wakes up an ultra-low-power parallel
processing unit to extract context-aware visual information. We evaluate the
smart sensor on three always-on visual triggering application scenarios.
Triggering accuracy comparable to RGB image sensors is achieved at nominal
lighting conditions, while consuming an average power between $193\mu W$ and
$277\mu W$, depending on context activity. The digital sub-system is extremely
flexible, thanks to a fully-programmable digital signal processing engine, but
still achieves 19x lower power consumption compared to MCU-based cameras with
significantly lower on-board computing capabilities.

 <dc:title>When to target hubs? Strategic Diffusion in Complex Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  What is the most effective way to spread a behavior on a network? The recent
literature on network diffusion has focused mostly on models of simple
contagion---where contagion can result from contact with a single &quot;infected&quot;
individual---and complex contagion---where contagion requires contact with
multiple &quot;infected&quot; sources. While in the case of simple contagion, strategies
focused on central nodes are known to be effective, the strategies that are
most effective in the case of complex contagion are relatively unknown. Here,
we study the strategies that optimize the diffusion of a behavior on a network
in the case of complex contagion by comparing algorithms that choose which
nodes to target at each step. We find that, contrary to the case of simple
contagion, where targeting central nodes is an effective strategy, in the case
of complex contagion minimizing the total diffusion time requires the use of
dynamic strategies targeting less connected nodes in the beginning and hubs at
a critical intermediate time. That is, the strategic question in the case of
complex contagion is not who to target, but when to target hubs. We solve the
model analytically for simple network structures and also use numerical
simulations to show that these dynamic strategies outperform simpler strategies
that could be hypothesized to be effective, like always choosing the node with
the highest probability of infection. These findings shed light on the dynamic
strategies that optimize network diffusion in the case of complex contagion.

 <dc:description>  As item trading becomes more popular, users can change their game items or
money into real money more easily. At the same time, hackers turn their eyes on
stealing other users game items or money because it is much easier to earn
money than traditional gold-farming by running game bots. Game companies
provide various security measures to block account- theft attempts, but many
security measures on the user-side are disregarded by users because of lack of
usability. In this study, we propose a server-side account theft detection
system base on action sequence analysis to protect game users from malicious
hackers. We tested this system in the real Massively Multiplayer Online Role
Playing Game (MMORPG). By analyzing users full game play log, our system can
find the particular action sequences of hackers with high accuracy. Also, we
can trace where the victim accounts stolen money goes.

 <dc:description>  We study the design of pricing mechanisms and auctions when the mechanism
designer does not know the distribution of buyers' values. Instead the
mechanism designer receives a set of samples from this distribution and his
goal is to use the sample to design a pricing mechanism or auction with high
expected profit. We provide generalization guarantees which bound the
difference between average profit on the sample and expected profit over the
distribution. These bounds are directly proportional to the intrinsic
complexity of the mechanism class the designer is optimizing over. We present a
single, overarching theorem that uses empirical Rademacher complexity to
measure the intrinsic complexity of a variety of widely-studied single- and
multi-item auction classes, including affine maximizer auctions, mixed-bundling
auctions, and second-price item auctions. Despite the extensive applicability
of our main theorem, we match and improve over the best-known generalization
guarantees for many auction classes. This all-encompassing theorem also applies
to multi- and single-item pricing mechanisms in both multi- and single-unit
settings, such as linear and non-linear pricing mechanisms. Finally, our
central theorem allows us to easily derive generalization guarantees for every
class in several finely grained hierarchies of auction and pricing mechanism
classes. We demonstrate how to determine the precise level in a hierarchy with
the optimal tradeoff between profit and generalization using structural profit
maximization. The mechanism classes we study are significantly different from
well-understood function classes typically found in machine learning, so
bounding their complexity requires a sharp understanding of the interplay
between mechanism parameters and buyer valuations.

 <dc:description>  Non-volatile memory (NVM) provides a scalable and power-efficient solution to
replace DRAM as main memory. However, because of relatively high latency and
low bandwidth of NVM, NVM is often paired with DRAM to build a heterogeneous
memory system (HMS). As a result, data objects of the application must be
carefully placed to NVM and DRAM for best performance. In this paper, we
introduce a lightweight runtime solution that automatically and transparently
manage data placement on HMS without the requirement of hardware modifications
and disruptive change to applications. Leveraging online profiling and
performance models, the runtime characterizes memory access patterns associated
with data objects, and minimizes unnecessary data movement. Our runtime
solution effectively bridges the performance gap between NVM and DRAM. We
demonstrate that using NVM to replace the majority of DRAM can be a feasible
solution for future HPC systems with the assistance of a software-based data
management.

 <dc:description>  This paper makes a focused contribution to supervised aspect extraction. It
shows that if the system has performed aspect extraction from many past domains
and retained their results as knowledge, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) can
leverage this knowledge in a lifelong learning manner to extract in a new
domain markedly better than the traditional CRF without using this prior
knowledge. The key innovation is that even after CRF training, the model can
still improve its extraction with experiences in its applications.

 <dc:description>  The dueling bandits problem is an online learning framework for learning from
pairwise preference feedback, and is particularly well-suited for modeling
settings that elicit subjective or implicit human feedback. In this paper, we
study the problem of multi-dueling bandits with dependent arms, which extends
the original dueling bandits setting by simultaneously dueling multiple arms as
well as modeling dependencies between arms. These extensions capture key
characteristics found in many real-world applications, and allow for the
opportunity to develop significantly more efficient algorithms than were
possible in the original setting. We propose the \selfsparring algorithm, which
reduces the multi-dueling bandits problem to a conventional bandit setting that
can be solved using a stochastic bandit algorithm such as Thompson Sampling,
and can naturally model dependencies using a Gaussian process prior. We present
a no-regret analysis for multi-dueling setting, and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm empirically on a wide range of simulation
settings.

 <dc:description>  The relationship of scientific knowledge development to technological
development is widely recognized as one of the most important and complex
aspects of technological evolution. This paper adds to our understanding of the

 <dc:description>  Resilience is a major design goal for HPC. Checkpoint is the most common
method to enable resilient HPC. Checkpoint periodically saves critical data
objects to non-volatile storage to enable data persistence. However, using
checkpoint, we face dilemmas between resilience, recomputation and checkpoint
cost. The reason that accounts for the dilemmas is the cost of data copying
inherent in checkpoint. In this paper we explore how to build resilient HPC
with non-volatile memory (NVM) as main memory and address the dilemmas. We
introduce a variety of optimization techniques that leverage high performance
and non-volatility of NVM to enable high performance data persistence for data
objects in applications. With NVM we avoid data copying; we optimize cache
flushing needed to ensure consistency between caches and NVM. We demonstrate
that using NVM is feasible to establish data persistence frequently with small
overhead (4.4% on average) to achieve highly resilient HPC and minimize
recomputation.

 <dc:description>  Understanding the application resilience in the presence of faults is
critical to address the HPC resilience challenge. Currently, we largely rely on
random fault injection (RFI) to quantify the application resilience. However,
RFI provides little information on how fault tolerance happens, and RFI results
are often not deterministic due to its random nature. In this paper, we
introduce a new methodology to quantify the application resilience. Our
methodology is based on the observation that at the application level, the
application resilience to faults is due to the application-level fault masking.
The application-level fault masking happens because of application-inherent
semantics and program constructs. Based on this observation, we analyze
application execution information and use a data-oriented approach to model the
application resilience. We use our model to study how and why HPC applications
can (or cannot) tolerate faults. We demonstrate tangible benefits of using the
model to direct fault tolerance mechanisms.

 <dc:title>Joint Denoising / Compression of Image Contours via Shape Prior and

 <dc:description>  With the advent of depth sensing technologies, the extraction of object
contours in images---a common and important pre-processing step for later
higher-level computer vision tasks like object detection and human action
recognition---has become easier. However, acquisition noise in captured depth
images means that detected contours suffer from unavoidable errors. In this
paper, we propose to jointly denoise and compress detected contours in an image
for bandwidth-constrained transmission to a client, who can then carry out
aforementioned application-specific tasks using the decoded contours as input.
We first prove theoretically that in general a joint denoising / compression
approach can outperform a separate two-stage approach that first denoises then
encodes contours lossily. Adopting a joint approach, we first propose a burst
error model that models typical errors encountered in an observed string y of
directional edges. We then formulate a rate-constrained maximum a posteriori
(MAP) problem that trades off the posterior probability p(x'|y) of an estimated
string x' given y with its code rate R(x'). We design a dynamic programming
(DP) algorithm that solves the posed problem optimally, and propose a compact
context representation called total suffix tree (TST) that can reduce
complexity of the algorithm dramatically. Experimental results show that our
joint denoising / compression scheme outperformed a competing separate scheme
in rate-distortion performance noticeably.

 <dc:description>  Despite being vastly ignored in the literature, coping with topological noise
is an issue of increasing importance, especially as a consequence of the
increasing number and diversity of 3D polygonal models that are captured by
devices of different qualities or synthesized by algorithms of different
stabilities. One approach for matching 3D shapes under topological noise is to
replace the topology-sensitive geodesic distance with distances that are less
sensitive to topological changes. We propose an alternative approach utilising
gradual deflation (or inflation) of the shape volume, of which purpose is to
bring the pair of shapes to be matched to a \emph{comparable} topology before
the search for correspondences. Illustrative experiments using different
datasets demonstrate that as the level of topological noise increases, our
approach outperforms the other methods in the literature.

 <dc:title>Indoor Frame Recovery from Refined Line Segments</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Guo, Luanzheng</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An important yet challenging problem in understanding indoor scene is
recovering indoor frame structure from a monocular image. It is more difficult
when occlusions and illumination vary, and object boundaries are weak. To
overcome these difficulties, a new approach based on line segment refinement
with two constraints is proposed. First, the line segments are refined by four
consecutive operations, i.e., reclassifying, connecting, fitting, and voting.
Specifically, misclassified line segments are revised by the reclassifying
operation, some short line segments are joined by the connecting operation, the
undetected key line segments are recovered by the fitting operation with the
help of the vanishing points, the line segments converging on the frame are
selected by the voting operation. Second, we construct four frame models
according to four classes of possible shooting angles of the monocular image,
the natures of all frame models are introduced via enforcing the cross ratio
and depth constraints. The indoor frame is then constructed by fitting those
refined line segments with related frame model under the two constraints, which
jointly advance the accuracy of the frame. Experimental results on a collection
of over 300 indoor images indicate that our algorithm has the capability of
recovering the frame from complex indoor scenes.

 <dc:description>  We consider linear systems of recurrence equations whose coefficients are
given in terms of indefinite nested sums and products covering, e.g., the
harmonic numbers, hypergeometric products, $q$-hypergeometric products or their
mixed versions. These linear systems are formulated in the setting of
$\Pi\Sigma$-extensions and our goal is to find a denominator bound (also known
as universal denominator) for the solutions; i.e., a non-zero polynomial $d$
such that the denominator of every solution of the system divides $d$. This is
the first step in computing all rational solutions of such a rather general
recurrence system. Once the denominator bound is known, the problem of solving
for rational solutions is reduced to the problem of solving for polynomial
solutions.

 <dc:description>  We show that first order logic (FO) and first order logic extended with
modulo counting quantifiers (FOMOD) over purely functional vocabularies which
extend addition, satisfy the Crane beach property (CBP) if the logic satisfies
a normal form (called positional normal form). This not only shows why logics
over the addition vocabulary have the CBP but also gives new CBP results, for
example for the vocabulary which extends addition with the exponentiation
function. The above results can also be viewed from the perspective of circuit
complexity. Showing the existence of regular languages not definable in
FOMOD[&lt;, +, *] is equivalent to the separation of the circuit complexity
classes ACC0 and NC1 . Our theorem shows that a weaker logic , namely,
FOMOD[&lt;,+,2^x] cannot define all regular languages.

 <dc:description>  How the online social media, like Twitter or its variant Weibo, interacts
with the stock market and whether it can be a convincing proxy to predict the
stock market have been debated for years, especially for China. As the
traditional theory in behavioral finance states, the individual emotions can
influence decision-makings of investors, it is reasonable to further explore
these controversial topics systematically from the perspective of online
emotions, which are richly carried by massive tweets in social media. Through
thorough studies on over 10 million stock-relevant tweets and 3 million
investors from Weibo, it is revealed that inexperienced investors with high
emotional volatility are more sensible to the market fluctuations than the
experienced or institutional ones, and their dominant occupation also indicates
that the Chinese market might be more emotional as compared to its western
counterparts. Then both correlation analysis and causality test demonstrate
that five attributes of the stock market in China can be competently predicted
by various online emotions, like disgust, joy, sadness and fear. Specifically,
the presented prediction model significantly outperforms the baseline model,
including the one taking purely financial time series as input features, on
predicting five attributes of the stock market under the $K$-means
discretization. We also employ this prediction model in the scenario of
realistic online application and its performance is further testified.

 <dc:description>  We present SurfCut, an algorithm for extracting a smooth, simple surface with
an unknown 3D curve boundary from a noisy 3D image and a seed point. Our method
is built on the novel observation that certain ridge curves of a function
defined on a front propagated using the Fast Marching algorithm lie on the
surface. Our method extracts and cuts these ridges to form the surface
boundary. Our surface extraction algorithm is built on the novel observation
that the surface lies in a valley of the distance from Fast Marching. We show
that the resulting surface is a collection of minimal paths. Using the
framework of cubical complexes and Morse theory, we design algorithms to
extract these critical structures robustly. Experiments on three 3D datasets
show the robustness of our method, and that it achieves higher accuracy with
lower computational cost than state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, to analyze end-to-end timing behavior in heterogeneous
processor and network environments accurately, we adopt a heterogeneous
selection value on communication contention (HSV_CC) algorithm, which can
synchronize tasks and messages simultaneously, for stream processing
distribution. In order to adapt HSV_CC to automotive data stream management
system (DSMSs), one must address three issues: (i) previous task and message
schedules might lead to less efficient resource usages; (ii) the conventional
method to determine the task scheduling order may not be best suited to deal
with stream processing graphs, and; (iii) there is a need to be able to
schedule tasks with time-varying computational requirements efficiently. To
address (i), we propose the heterogeneous value with load balancing and
communication contention (HVLB_CC) (A) algorithm, which considers load
balancing in addition to the parameters considered by the HSV_CC algorithm. We
propose HVLB_CC (B) to address issue (ii). HVLB_CC (B) can deal with stream
processing task graphs and more various directed acyclic graphs to prevent
assigning a higher priority to successor tasks. In addition, to address issue
(iii), we propose HVLB_CC_IC. To schedule tasks more efficiently with various
computation times, HVLB_CC_IC utilizes schedule holes left in processors. These
idle time slots can be used for the execution of an optional part to generate
more precise data results by applying imprecise computation models.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms improve minimum
schedule length, accuracy, and load balancing significantly compared to the
HSV_CC algorithm. In addition, the proposed HVLB_CC (B) algorithm can schedule
more varied task graphs without reducing performance, and, using imprecise
computation models, HVLB_CC_IC yields higher precision data than HVLB_CC
without imprecise computation models.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of developing automated techniques for solving
recurrence relations to aid the expected-runtime analysis of programs. Several
classical textbook algorithms have quite efficient expected-runtime complexity,
whereas the corresponding worst-case bounds are either inefficient (e.g.,
QUICK-SORT), or completely ineffective (e.g., COUPON-COLLECTOR). Since the main
focus of expected-runtime analysis is to obtain efficient bounds, we consider
bounds that are either logarithmic, linear, or almost-linear ($\mathcal{O}(\log
n)$, $\mathcal{O}(n)$, $\mathcal{O}(n\cdot\log n)$, respectively, where n
represents the input size). Our main contribution is an efficient (simple
linear-time algorithm) sound approach for deriving such expected-runtime bounds
for the analysis of recurrence relations induced by randomized algorithms. Our
approach can infer the asymptotically optimal expected-runtime bounds for
recurrences of classical randomized algorithms, including RANDOMIZED-SEARCH,
QUICK-SORT, QUICK-SELECT, COUPONCOLLECTOR, where the worst-case bounds are
either inefficient (such as linear as compared to logarithmic of
expected-runtime, or quadratic as compared to linear or almost-linear of
expected-runtime), or ineffective. We have implemented our approach, and the
experimental results show that we obtain the bounds efficiently for the
recurrences of various classical algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Deep latent variable models have been shown to facilitate the response
generation for open-domain dialog systems. However, these latent variables are
highly randomized, leading to uncontrollable generated responses. In this
paper, we propose a framework allowing conditional response generation based on
specific attributes. These attributes can be either manually assigned or
automatically detected. Moreover, the dialog states for both speakers are
modeled separately in order to reflect personal features. We validate this
framework on two different scenarios, where the attribute refers to genericness
and sentiment states respectively. The experiment result testified the
potential of our model, where meaningful responses can be generated in
accordance with the specified attributes.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of developing efficient approaches for proving
worst-case bounds of non-deterministic recursive programs. Ranking functions
are sound and complete for proving termination and worst-case bounds of
nonrecursive programs. First, we apply ranking functions to recursion,
resulting in measure functions. We show that measure functions provide a sound
and complete approach to prove worst-case bounds of non-deterministic recursive
programs. Our second contribution is the synthesis of measure functions in
nonpolynomial forms. We show that non-polynomial measure functions with
logarithm and exponentiation can be synthesized through abstraction of
logarithmic or exponentiation terms, Farkas' Lemma, and Handelman's Theorem
using linear programming. While previous methods obtain worst-case polynomial
bounds, our approach can synthesize bounds of the form $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$
as well as $\mathcal{O}(n^r)$ where $r$ is not an integer. We present
experimental results to demonstrate that our approach can obtain efficiently
worst-case bounds of classical recursive algorithms such as (i) Merge-Sort, the
divide-and-conquer algorithm for the Closest-Pair problem, where we obtain
$\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ worst-case bound, and (ii) Karatsuba's algorithm for
polynomial multiplication and Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication,
where we obtain $\mathcal{O}(n^r)$ bound such that $r$ is not an integer and
close to the best-known bounds for the respective algorithms.

 <dc:title>An Order-based Algorithm for Minimum Dominating Set with Application in
  Graph Mining</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chalupa, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Dominating set is a set of vertices of a graph such that all other vertices
have a neighbour in the dominating set. We propose a new order-based randomised
local search (RLS$_o$) algorithm to solve minimum dominating set problem in
large graphs. Experimental evaluation is presented for multiple types of
problem instances. These instances include unit disk graphs, which represent a
model of wireless networks, random scale-free networks, as well as samples from
two social networks and real-world graphs studied in network science. Our
experiments indicate that RLS$_o$ performs better than both a classical greedy
approximation algorithm and two metaheuristic algorithms based on ant colony
optimisation and local search. The order-based algorithm is able to find small
dominating sets for graphs with tens of thousands of vertices. In addition, we
propose a multi-start variant of RLS$_o$ that is suitable for solving the
minimum weight dominating set problem. The application of RLS$_o$ in graph
mining is also briefly demonstrated.

 <dc:description>  Different from other sequential data, sentences in natural language are
structured by linguistic grammars. Previous generative conversational models
with chain-structured decoder ignore this structure in human language and might
generate plausible responses with less satisfactory relevance and fluency. In
this study, we aim to incorporate the results from linguistic analysis into the
process of sentence generation for high-quality conversation generation.
Specifically, we use a dependency parser to transform each response sentence
into a dependency tree and construct a training corpus of sentence-tree pairs.
A tree-structured decoder is developed to learn the mapping from a sentence to
its tree, where different types of hidden states are used to depict the local
dependencies from an internal tree node to its children. For training
acceleration, we propose a tree canonicalization method, which transforms trees
into equivalent ternary trees. Then, with a proposed tree-structured search
method, the model is able to generate the most probable responses in the form
of dependency trees, which are finally flattened into sequences as the system
output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed X2Tree framework
outperforms baseline methods over 11.15% increase of acceptance ratio.

 <dc:description>  Linear synthesis model based dictionary learning framework has achieved
remarkable performances in image classification in the last decade. Behaved as
a generative feature model, it however suffers from some intrinsic
deficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel parametric nonlinear analysis
cosparse model (NACM) with which a unique feature vector will be much more
efficiently extracted. Additionally, we derive a deep insight to demonstrate
that NACM is capable of simultaneously learning the task adapted feature
transformation and regularization to encode our preferences, domain prior
knowledge and task oriented supervised information into the features. The
proposed NACM is devoted to the classification task as a discriminative feature
model and yield a novel discriminative nonlinear analysis operator learning
framework (DNAOL). The theoretical analysis and experimental performances
clearly demonstrate that DNAOL will not only achieve the better or at least
competitive classification accuracies than the state-of-the-art algorithms but
it can also dramatically reduce the time complexities in both training and
testing phases.

 <dc:description>  The Meeting problem for $k\geq 2$ searchers in a polygon $P$ (possibly with
holes) consists in making the searchers move within $P$, according to a
distributed algorithm, in such a way that at least two of them eventually come
to see each other, regardless of their initial positions. The polygon is
initially unknown to the searchers, and its edges obstruct both movement and
vision. Depending on the shape of $P$, we minimize the number of searchers $k$
for which the Meeting problem is solvable. Specifically, if $P$ has a
rotational symmetry of order $\sigma$ (where $\sigma=1$ corresponds to no
rotational symmetry), we prove that $k=\sigma+1$ searchers are sufficient, and
the bound is tight. Furthermore, we give an improved algorithm that optimally
solves the Meeting problem with $k=2$ searchers in all polygons whose
barycenter is not in a hole (which includes the polygons with no holes). Our
algorithms can be implemented in a variety of standard models of mobile robots
operating in Look-Compute-Move cycles. For instance, if the searchers have
memory but are anonymous, asynchronous, and have no agreement on a coordinate
system or a notion of clockwise direction, then our algorithms work even if the
initial memory contents of the searchers are arbitrary and possibly misleading.
Moreover, oblivious searchers can execute our algorithms as well, encoding
information by carefully positioning themselves within the polygon. This code
is computable with basic arithmetic operations, and each searcher can
geometrically construct its own destination point at each cycle using only a
compass. We stress that such memoryless searchers may be located anywhere in
the polygon when the execution begins, and hence the information they initially
encode is arbitrary. Our algorithms use a self-stabilizing map construction
subroutine which is of independent interest.

 <dc:title>Composition Operators, Matrix Representation, and the Finite Section
  Method: A Theoretical Framework for Maps between Shapes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Glashoff, Klaus</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ortlieb, Claus Peter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper intends to lay the theoretical foundation for the method of
functional maps, first presented in 2012 by Ovsjanikov, Ben-Chen, Solomon,
Butscher and Guibas in the field of the theory and numerics of maps between
shapes. We show how to analyze this method by looking at it as an application
of the theories of composition operators, of matrix representa- tion of
operators on separable Hilbert spaces, and of the theory of the Finite Section
Method. These are three well known fruitful topics in functional analysis. When
applied to the task of modelling of correspondences of shapes in
three-dimensional space, these concepts lead directly to functional maps and
its associated functional matrices. Mathematically spoken, functional maps are
composition operators between two-dimensional manifolds, and functional
matrices are infinite matrix representations of such maps. We present an
introduction into the notion and theoretical foundation of the functional
analytic framework of the theory of matrix repre- sentation, especially of
composition operators. We will also discuss two numerical methods for solving
equations with such operators, namely, two variants of the Rectangular Finite
Section Method. While one of these, which is well known, leads to an
overdetermined system of linear equations, in the second one the minimum-norm
solution of an underdetermined system has to be computed. We will present the
main convergence results related to these methods.

 <dc:description>  A $(\beta,\epsilon)$-$\textit{hopset}$ is, informally, a weighted edge set
that, when added to a graph, allows one to get from point $a$ to point $b$
using a path with at most $\beta$ edges (&quot;hops&quot;) and length
$(1+\epsilon)\mathrm{dist}(a,b)$. In this paper we observe that Thorup and
Zwick's $\textit{sublinear additive}$ emulators are also actually
$(O(k/\epsilon)^k,\epsilon)$-hopsets for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, and that with a
small change to the Thorup-Zwick construction, the size of the hopset can be
made $O(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^{k+1}-1}})$. As corollaries, we also shave &quot;$k$&quot;
factors off the size of Thorup and Zwick's sublinear additive emulators and the
sparsest known $(1+\epsilon,O(k/\epsilon)^{k-1})$-spanners, due to Abboud,
Bodwin, and Pettie.

 <dc:description>  Active Search has become an increasingly useful tool in information retrieval
problems where the goal is to discover as many target elements as possible
using only limited label queries. With the advent of big data, there is a
growing emphasis on the scalability of such techniques to handle very large and
very complex datasets.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of Active Search where we are given a
similarity function between data points. We look at an algorithm introduced by
Wang et al. [2013] for Active Search over graphs and propose crucial
modifications which allow it to scale significantly. Their approach selects
points by minimizing an energy function over the graph induced by the
similarity function on the data. Our modifications require the similarity
function to be a dot-product between feature vectors of data points, equivalent
to having a linear kernel for the adjacency matrix. With this, we are able to
scale tremendously: for $n$ data points, the original algorithm runs in
$O(n^2)$ time per iteration while ours runs in only $O(nr + r^2)$ given
$r$-dimensional features.
  We also describe a simple alternate approach using a weighted-neighbor
predictor which also scales well. In our experiments, we show that our method
is competitive with existing semi-supervised approaches. We also briefly
discuss conditions under which our algorithm performs well.

 <dc:description>  Mental illnesses adversely affect a significant proportion of the population
worldwide. However, the methods traditionally used for estimating and
characterizing the prevalence of mental health conditions are time-consuming
and expensive. Consequently, best-available estimates concerning the prevalence
of mental health conditions are often years out of date. Automated approaches
to supplement these survey methods with broad, aggregated information derived
from social media content provides a potential means for near real-time
estimates at scale. These may, in turn, provide grist for supporting,
evaluating and iteratively improving upon public health programs and
interventions.
  We propose a novel model for automated mental health status quantification
that incorporates user embeddings. This builds upon recent work exploring
representation learning methods that induce embeddings by leveraging social
media post histories. Such embeddings capture latent characteristics of
individuals (e.g., political leanings) and encode a soft notion of homophily.
In this paper, we investigate whether user embeddings learned from twitter post
histories encode information that correlates with mental health statuses. To
this end, we estimated user embeddings for a set of users known to be affected
by depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and for a set of
demographically matched `control' users. We then evaluated these embeddings
with respect to: (i) their ability to capture homophilic relations with respect
to mental health status; and (ii) the performance of downstream mental health
prediction models based on these features. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the user embeddings capture similarities between users with respect to
mental conditions, and are predictive of mental health.

 <dc:description>  Open world games present players with more freedom than games with linear
progression structures. However, without clearly-defined objectives, they often
leave players without a sense of purpose. Most of the time, quests and
objectives are hand-authored and overlaid atop an open world's mechanics. But
what if they could be generated organically from the gameplay itself? The goal
of our project was to develop a model of the mechanics in Minecraft that could
be used to determine the ideal placement of objectives in an open world
setting. We formalized the game logic of Minecraft in terms of logical rules
that can be manipulated in two ways: they may be executed to generate graphs
representative of the player experience when playing an open world game with
little developer direction; and they may be statically analyzed to determine
dependency orderings, feedback loops, and bottlenecks. These analyses may then
be used to place achievements on gameplay actions algorithmically.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The exponential scaling of the wave function is a fundamental property of
quantum systems with far reaching implications in our ability to process
quantum information. A problem where these are particularly relevant is quantum
state tomography. State tomography, whose objective is to obtain a full
description of a quantum system, can be analysed in the framework of
computational learning theory. In this model, quantum states have been shown to
be Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-learnable with sample complexity linear
in the number of qubits. However, it is conjectured that in general quantum
states require an exponential amount of computation to be learned. Here, using
results from the literature on the efficient classical simulation of quantum
systems, we show that stabiliser states are efficiently PAC-learnable. Our
results solve an open problem formulated by Aaronson [Proc. R. Soc. A, 2088,
(2007)] and propose learning theory as a tool for exploring the power of
quantum computation.

 <dc:description>  Deep Learning refers to a set of machine learning techniques that utilize
neural networks with many hidden layers for tasks, such as image
classification, speech recognition, language understanding. Deep learning has
been proven to be very effective in these domains and is pervasively used by
many Internet services. In this paper, we describe different automotive uses
cases for deep learning in particular in the domain of computer vision. We
surveys the current state-of-the-art in libraries, tools and infrastructures
(e.\,g.\ GPUs and clouds) for implementing, training and deploying deep neural
networks. We particularly focus on convolutional neural networks and computer
vision use cases, such as the visual inspection process in manufacturing plants
and the analysis of social media data. To train neural networks, curated and
labeled datasets are essential. In particular, both the availability and scope
of such datasets is typically very limited. A main contribution of this paper
is the creation of an automotive dataset, that allows us to learn and
automatically recognize different vehicle properties. We describe an end-to-end
deep learning application utilizing a mobile app for data collection and
process support, and an Amazon-based cloud backend for storage and training.
For training we evaluate the use of cloud and on-premises infrastructures
(including multiple GPUs) in conjunction with different neural network
architectures and frameworks. We assess both the training times as well as the
accuracy of the classifier. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
trained classifier in a real world setting during manufacturing process.

 <dc:description>  Learning from large datasets has been a challenge irrespective of the Machine
Learning approach used. Twin Support Vector Machines (TWSVMs) have proved to be
an efficient alternative to Support Vector Machine (SVM) for learning from
imbalanced datasets. However, the TWSVM is unsuitable for large datasets due to
the matrix inversion operations required. In this paper, we discuss a Twin
Neural Network for learning from large datasets that are unbalanced, while
optimizing the feature map at the same time. Our results clearly demonstrate
the generalization ability and scalability obtained by the Twin Neural Network
on large unbalanced datasets.

 <dc:description>  This article considers a resource allocation problem for monitoring
infrastructure networks facing strategic disruptions. The network operator is
interested in determining the minimum number of sensors and a sensing strategy,
to ensure a desired detection performance against simultaneous failures induced
by a resource-constrained attacker. To address this problem, we formulate a
mathematical program with constraints involving the mixed strategy Nash
equilibria of an operator-attacker game. The set of player strategies in this
game are determined by the network structure and players' resources, and grow
combinatorially with the network size. Thus, well-known algorithms for
computing equilibria in strategic games cannot be used to evaluate the
constraints in our problem. We present a solution approach based on two
combinatorial optimization problems, formulated as minimum set cover and
maximum set packing problems. By using a combination of game-theoretic and
combinatorial arguments, we show that the resulting solution has guarantees on
the detection performance and admits a small optimality gap in practical
settings. Importantly, this approach is scalable to large-scale networks. We
also identify a sufficient condition on the network structure for this solution
to be optimal. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability and optimality guarantee
of our approach using a set of benchmark water networks.

 <dc:description>  We study two-player inclusion games played over word-generating higher-order
recursion schemes. While inclusion checks are known to capture verification
problems, two-player games generalize this relationship to program synthesis.
In such games, non-terminals of the grammar are controlled by opposing players.
The goal of the existential player is to avoid producing a word that lies
outside of a regular language of safe words.
  We contribute a new domain that provides a representation of the winning
region of such games. Our domain is based on (functions over) potentially
infinite Boolean formulas with words as atomic propositions. We develop an
abstract interpretation framework that we instantiate to abstract this domain
into a domain where the propositions are replaced by states of a finite
automaton. This second domain is therefore finite and we obtain, via standard
fixed-point techniques, a direct algorithm for the analysis of two-player
inclusion games. We show, via a second instantiation of the framework, that our
finite domain can be optimized, leading to a (k+1)EXP algorithm for order-k
recursion schemes. We give a matching lower bound, showing that our approach is
optimal. Since our approach is based on standard Kleene iteration, existing
techniques and tools for fixed-point computations can be applied.

 <dc:description>  Evergreens in science are papers that display a continual rise in annual
citations without decline, at least within a sufficiently long time period.
Aiming to better understand evergreens in particular and patterns of citation
trajectory in general, this paper develops a functional data analysis method to
cluster citation trajectories of a sample of 1699 research papers published in
1980 in the American Physical Society (APS) journals. We propose a functional
Poisson regression model for individual papers' citation trajectories, and fit
the model to the observed 30-year citations of individual papers by functional
principal component analysis and maximum likelihood estimation. Based on the
estimated paper-specific coefficients, we apply the K-means clustering
algorithm to cluster papers into different groups, for uncovering general types
of citation trajectories. The result demonstrates the existence of an evergreen
cluster of papers that do not exhibit any decline in annual citations over 30
years.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel real-time method for tracking salient closed
boundaries from video image sequences. This method operates on a set of
straight line segments that are produced by line detection. The tracking scheme
is coherently integrated into a perceptual grouping framework in which the
visual tracking problem is tackled by identifying a subset of these line
segments and connecting them sequentially to form a closed boundary with the
largest saliency and a certain similarity to the previous one. Specifically, we
define a new tracking criterion which combines a grouping cost and an area
similarity constraint. The proposed criterion makes the resulting boundary
tracking more robust to local minima. To achieve real-time tracking
performance, we use Delaunay Triangulation to build a graph model with the
detected line segments and then reduce the tracking problem to finding the
optimal cycle in this graph. This is solved by our newly proposed closed
boundary candidates searching algorithm called &quot;Bidirectional Shortest Path
(BDSP)&quot;. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed method are tested on
real video sequences as well as during a robot arm pouring experiment.

LSTM recurrent networks to underperform word averaging, we present several
developments that together produce the opposite conclusion. These include
training on sentence pairs rather than phrase pairs, averaging states to
represent sequences, and regularizing aggressively. These improve LSTMs in both
transfer learning and supervised settings. We also introduce a new recurrent
architecture, the Gated Recurrent Averaging Network, that is inspired by
averaging and LSTMs while outperforming them both. We analyze our learned
models, finding evidence of preferences for particular parts of speech and
dependency relations.

 <dc:description>  We propose the ambiguity problem for the foreground object segmentation task
and motivate the importance of estimating and accounting for this ambiguity
when designing vision systems. Specifically, we distinguish between images
which lead multiple annotators to segment different foreground objects
(ambiguous) versus minor inter-annotator differences of the same object. Taking
images from eight widely used datasets, we crowdsource labeling the images as
&quot;ambiguous&quot; or &quot;not ambiguous&quot; to segment in order to construct a new dataset
we call STATIC. Using STATIC, we develop a system that automatically predicts
which images are ambiguous. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of our
prediction system over existing saliency-based methods on images from vision
benchmarks and images taken by blind people who are trying to recognize objects
in their environment. Finally, we introduce a crowdsourcing system to achieve
cost savings for collecting the diversity of all valid &quot;ground truth&quot;
foreground object segmentations by collecting extra segmentations only when
ambiguity is expected. Experiments show our system eliminates up to 47% of
human effort compared to existing crowdsourcing methods with no loss in
capturing the diversity of ground truths.

 <dc:description>  Rapid development of evolutionary algorithms in handling many-objective
optimization problems requires viable methods of visualizing a high-dimensional
solution set. Parallel coordinates which scale well to high-dimensional data
are such a method, and have been frequently used in evolutionary many-objective
optimization. However, the parallel coordinates plot is not as straightforward
as the classic scatter plot to present the information contained in a solution
set. In this paper, we make some observations of the parallel coordinates plot,
in terms of comparing the quality of solution sets, understanding the shape and
distribution of a solution set, and reflecting the relation between objectives.
We hope that these observations could provide some guidelines as to the proper
use of parallel coordinates in evolutionary many-objective optimization.

 <dc:description>  Today's routing protocols critically rely on the assumption that the
underlying hardware is trusted. Given the increasing number of attacks on
network devices, and recent reports on hardware backdoors this assumption has
become questionable. Indeed, with the critical role computer networks play
today, the contrast between our security assumptions and reality is
problematic.
  This paper presents Software-Defined Adversarial Trajectory Sampling
(SoftATS), an OpenFlow-based mechanism to efficiently monitor packet
trajectories, also in the presence of non-cooperating or even adversarial
switches or routers, e.g., containing hardware backdoors. Our approach is based
on a secure, redundant and adaptive sample distribution scheme which allows us
to provably detect adversarial switches or routers trying to reroute, mirror,
drop, inject, or modify packets (i.e., header and/or payload). We evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach in different adversarial settings, report on a
proof-of-concept implementation, and provide a first evaluation of the
performance overheads of such a scheme.

 <dc:description>  Matrix completion is a problem that arises in many data-analysis settings
where the input consists of a partially-observed matrix (e.g., recommender
systems, traffic matrix analysis etc.). Classical approaches to matrix
completion assume that the input partially-observed matrix is low rank. The
success of these methods depends on the number of observed entries and the rank
of the matrix; the larger the rank, the more entries need to be observed in
order to accurately complete the matrix. In this paper, we deal with matrices
that are not necessarily low rank themselves, but rather they contain low-rank
submatrices. We propose Targeted, which is a general framework for completing
such matrices. In this framework, we first extract the low-rank submatrices and
then apply a matrix-completion algorithm to these low-rank submatrices as well
as the remainder matrix separately. Although for the completion itself we use
state-of-the-art completion methods, our results demonstrate that Targeted
achieves significantly smaller reconstruction errors than other classical
matrix-completion methods. One of the key technical contributions of the paper
lies in the identification of the low-rank submatrices from the input
partially-observed matrices.

 <dc:description>  We examine two greedy heuristics - wiring and rewiring - for constructing
maximum assortative graphs over all simple connected graphs with a target
degree sequence. Counterexamples show that natural greedy rewiring heuristics
do not necessarily return a maximum assortative graph, even though it is known
that the meta-graph of all simple connected graphs with given degree is
connected under rewiring. Counterexamples show an elegant greedy wiring
heuristic from the literature may fail to achieve the target degree sequence or
may fail to have the maximum assortativity.

 <dc:description>  The next wave of communication and applications rely on the new services
provided by Internet of Things which is becoming an important aspect in human
and machines future. The IoT services are a key solution for providing smart
environments in homes, buildings and cities. In the era of a massive number of
connected things and objects with a high grow rate, several challenges have
been raised such as management, aggregation and storage for big produced data.
In order to tackle some of these issues, cloud computing emerged to IoT as
Cloud of Things (CoT) which provides virtually unlimited cloud services to
enhance the large scale IoT platforms. There are several factors to be
considered in design and implementation of a CoT platform. One of the most
important and challenging problems is the heterogeneity of different objects.
This problem can be addressed by deploying suitable &quot;Middleware&quot;. Middleware
sits between things and applications that make a reliable platform for
communication among things with different interfaces, operating systems, and
architectures. The main aim of this paper is to study the middleware
technologies for CoT. Toward this end, we first present the main features and
characteristics of middlewares. Next we study different architecture styles and
service domains. Then we presents several middlewares that are suitable for CoT
based platforms and lastly a list of current challenges and issues in design of
CoT based middlewares is discussed.

 <dc:description>  For human pose estimation in monocular images, joint occlusions and
overlapping upon human bodies often result in deviated pose predictions. Under
these circumstances, biologically implausible pose predictions may be produced.
In contrast, human vision is able to predict poses by exploiting geometric
constraints of joint inter-connectivity. To address the problem by
incorporating priors about the structure of human bodies, we propose a novel
structure-aware convolutional network to implicitly take such priors into
account during training of the deep network. Explicit learning of such
constraints is typically challenging. Instead, we design discriminators to
distinguish the real poses from the fake ones (such as biologically implausible
ones). If the pose generator (G) generates results that the discriminator fails
to distinguish from real ones, the network successfully learns the priors.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the Duluth systems that participated in Task 14 of
SemEval 2016, Semantic Taxonomy Enrichment. There were three related systems in
the formal evaluation which are discussed here, along with numerous
post--evaluation runs. All of these systems identified synonyms between WordNet
and other dictionaries by measuring the gloss overlaps between them. These
systems perform better than the random baseline and one post--evaluation
variation was within a respectable margin of the median result attained by all
participating systems.

 <dc:description>  Face recognition has the perception of a solved problem, however when tested
at the million-scale exhibits dramatic variation in accuracies across the
different algorithms. Are the algorithms very different? Is access to good/big
training data their secret weapon? Where should face recognition improve? To
address those questions, we created a benchmark, MF2, that requires all
algorithms to be trained on same data, and tested at the million scale. MF2 is
a public large-scale set with 672K identities and 4.7M photos created with the
goal to level playing field for large scale face recognition. We contrast our
results with findings from the other two large-scale benchmarks MegaFace
Challenge and MS-Celebs-1M where groups were allowed to train on any
private/public/big/small set. Some key discoveries: 1) algorithms, trained on
MF2, were able to achieve state of the art and comparable results to algorithms
trained on massive private sets, 2) some outperformed themselves once trained
on MF2, 3) invariance to aging suffers from low accuracies as in MegaFace,
identifying the need for larger age variations possibly within identities or
adjustment of algorithms in future testings.

 <dc:description>  In many applications, e.g., recommender systems and traffic monitoring, the
data comes in the form of a matrix that is only partially observed and low
rank. A fundamental data-analysis task for these datasets is matrix completion,
where the goal is to accurately infer the entries missing from the matrix. Even
when the data satisfies the low-rank assumption, classical matrix-completion
methods may output completions with significant error -- in that the
reconstructed matrix differs significantly from the true underlying matrix.
Often, this is due to the fact that the information contained in the observed
entries is insufficient. In this work, we address this problem by proposing an
active version of matrix completion, where queries can be made to the true
underlying matrix. Subsequently, we design Order&amp;Extend, which is the first
algorithm to unify a matrix-completion approach and a querying strategy into a
single algorithm. Order&amp;Extend is able identify and alleviate insufficient
information by judiciously querying a small number of additional entries. In an
extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that
our algorithm is efficient and is able to accurately reconstruct the true
matrix while asking only a small number of queries.

 <dc:description>  A fundamental question in systems biology is what combinations of mean and
variance of the species present in a stochastic biochemical reaction network
are attainable by perturbing the system with an external signal. To address
this question, we show that the moments evolution in any generic network can be
either approximated or, under suitable assumptions, computed exactly as the
solution of a switched affine system. Motivated by this application, we propose
a new method to approximate the reachable set of switched affine systems. A
remarkable feature of our approach is that it allows one to easily compute
projections of the reachable set for pairs of moments of interest, without
requiring the computation of the full reachable set, which can be prohibitive
for large networks. As a second contribution, we also show how to select the
external signal in order to maximize the probability of reaching a target set.
To illustrate the method we study a renown model of controlled gene expression
and we derive estimates of the reachable set, for the protein mean and
variance, that are more accurate than those available in the literature and
consistent with experimental data.

 <dc:description>  Dependency parses are an effective way to inject linguistic knowledge into
many downstream tasks, and many practitioners wish to efficiently parse
sentences at scale. Recent advances in GPU hardware have enabled neural
networks to achieve significant gains over the previous best models, these
models still fail to leverage GPUs' capability for massive parallelism due to
their requirement of sequential processing of the sentence. In response, we
propose Dilated Iterated Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DIG-CNNs) for
graph-based dependency parsing, a graph convolutional architecture that allows
for efficient end-to-end GPU parsing. In experiments on the English Penn
TreeBank benchmark, we show that DIG-CNNs perform on par with some of the best
neural network parsers.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we establish a new bound tying together the effective length
and the maximum correlation between the outputs of an arbitrary pair of Boolean
functions which operate on two sequences of correlated random variables. We
derive a new upper bound on the correlation between the outputs of these
functions. The upper bound may find applications in problems in many areas
which deal with common information. We build upon Witsenhausen's result on
maximum correlation. The present upper bound takes into account the effective
length of the Boolean functions in characterizing the correlation.
  We use the new bound to characterize the communication-cooperation tradeoff
in multi-terminal communications. We investigate binary block-codes (BBC). A
BBC is defined as a vector of Boolean functions. We consider an ensemble of
BBCs which is randomly generated using single-letter distributions. We
characterize the vector of dependency spectrums of these BBCs. We use this
vector to bound the correlation between the outputs of two distributed BBCs.
Finally, the upper bound is used to show that the large blocklength
single-letter coding schemes studied in the literature are sub-optimal in
various multi-terminal communication settings.

 <dc:description>  We characterize the capacity region of the symmetric injective K-user
Deterministic Interference Channel (DIC) for all channel parameters. The
achievable rate region is derived by first projecting the achievable rate
region of Han-Kobayashi (HK) scheme, which is in terms of common and private
rates for each user, along the direction of aggregate rates for each user
(i.e., the sum of common and private rates). We then show that the projected
region is characterized by only the projection of those facets in the HK region
for which the coefficient of common rate and private rate are the same for all
users, hence simplifying the region. Furthermore, we derive a tight converse
for each facet of the simplified achievable rate region.

 <dc:description>  The sheer sizes of modern datasets are forcing data-structure designers to
consider seriously both parallel construction and compactness. To achieve those
goals we need to design a parallel algorithm with good scalability and with low
memory consumption. An algorithm with good scalability improves its performance
when the number of available cores increases, and an algorithm with low memory
consumption uses memory proportional to the space used by the dataset in
uncompact form. In this work, we discuss the engineering of a parallel
algorithm with linear work and logarithmic span for the construction of the
compact representation of planar embeddings. We also provide an experimental
study of our implementation and prove experimentally that it has good
scalability and low memory consumption. Additionally, we describe and test
experimentally queries supported by the compact representation.

 <dc:title>Model Transfer for Tagging Low-resource Languages using a Bilingual

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cross-lingual model transfer is a compelling and popular method for
predicting annotations in a low-resource language, whereby parallel corpora
provide a bridge to a high-resource language and its associated annotated
corpora. However, parallel data is not readily available for many languages,
limiting the applicability of these approaches. We address these drawbacks in
our framework which takes advantage of cross-lingual word embeddings trained
solely on a high coverage bilingual dictionary. We propose a novel neural
network model for joint training from both sources of data based on
cross-lingual word embeddings, and show substantial empirical improvements over
baseline techniques. We also propose several active learning heuristics, which
result in improvements over competitive benchmark methods.

 <dc:title>Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Sliding Tokens on Cactus Graphs and Block

 <dc:description>  Given two independent sets $I, J$ of a graph $G$, and imagine that a token
(coin) is placed at each vertex of $I$. The Sliding Token problem asks if one
could transform $I$ to $J$ via a sequence of elementary steps, where each step
requires sliding a token from one vertex to one of its neighbors so that the
resulting set of vertices where tokens are placed remains independent. This
problem is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete even for planar graphs of maximum degree
$3$ and bounded-treewidth. In this paper, we show that Sliding Token can be
solved efficiently for cactus graphs and block graphs, and give upper bounds on
the length of a transformation sequence between any two independent sets of
these graph classes. Our algorithms are designed based on two main
observations. First, all structures that forbid the existence of a sequence of
token slidings between $I$ and $J$, if exist, can be found in polynomial time.
A sufficient condition for determining no-instances can be easily derived using
this characterization. Second, without such forbidden structures, a sequence of
token slidings between $I$ and $J$ does exist. In this case, one can indeed
transform $I$ to $J$ (and vice versa) using a polynomial number of
token-slides.

 <dc:title>Sub-Pixel Registration of Wavelet-Encoded Images</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sub-pixel registration is a crucial step for applications such as
super-resolution in remote sensing, motion compensation in magnetic resonance
imaging, and non-destructive testing in manufacturing, to name a few. Recently,
these technologies have been trending towards wavelet encoded imaging and
sparse/compressive sensing. The former plays a crucial role in reducing imaging
artifacts, while the latter significantly increases the acquisition speed. In
view of these new emerging needs for applications of wavelet encoded imaging,
we propose a sub-pixel registration method that can achieve direct wavelet
domain registration from a sparse set of coefficients. We make the following
contributions: (i) We devise a method of decoupling scale, rotation, and
translation parameters in the Haar wavelet domain, (ii) We derive explicit
mathematical expressions that define in-band sub-pixel registration in terms of
wavelet coefficients, (iii) Using the derived expressions, we propose an
approach to achieve in-band subpixel registration, avoiding back and forth
transformations. (iv) Our solution remains highly accurate even when a sparse
set of coefficients are used, which is due to localization of signals in a
sparse set of wavelet coefficients. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method,
and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art on simulated and real data,
even when the data is sparse.

 <dc:description>  Template estimation plays a crucial role in computational anatomy since it
provides reference frames for performing statistical analysis of the underlying
anatomical population variability. While building models for template
estimation, variability in sites and image acquisition protocols need to be
accounted for. To account for such variability, we propose a generative
template estimation model that makes simultaneous inference of both bias fields
in individual images, deformations for image registration, and variance
hyperparameters. In contrast, existing maximum a posterori based methods need
to rely on either bias-invariant similarity measures or robust image
normalization. Results on synthetic and real brain MRI images demonstrate the
capability of the model to capture heterogeneity in intensities and provide a
reliable template estimation from registration.

 <dc:description>  The quality of a Neural Machine Translation system depends substantially on
the availability of sizable parallel corpora. For low-resource language pairs
this is not the case, resulting in poor translation quality. Inspired by work
in computer vision, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that targets
low-frequency words by generating new sentence pairs containing rare words in
new, synthetically created contexts. Experimental results on simulated
low-resource settings show that our method improves translation quality by up
to 2.9 BLEU points over the baseline and up to 3.2 BLEU over back-translation.

 <dc:description>  Distributed word representations are widely used for modeling words in NLP
tasks. Most of the existing models generate one representation per word and do
not consider different meanings of a word. We present two approaches to learn
multiple topic-sensitive representations per word by using Hierarchical
Dirichlet Process. We observe that by modeling topics and integrating topic
distributions for each document we obtain representations that are able to
distinguish between different meanings of a given word. Our models yield
statistically significant improvements for the lexical substitution task
indicating that commonly used single word representations, even when combined
with contextual information, are insufficient for this task.

 <dc:description>  Graph filters play a key role in processing the graph spectra of signals
supported on the vertices of a graph. However, despite their widespread use,
graph filters have been analyzed only in the deterministic setting, ignoring
the impact of stochastic- ity in both the graph topology as well as the signal
itself. To bridge this gap, we examine the statistical behavior of the two key
filter types, finite impulse response (FIR) and autoregressive moving average
(ARMA) graph filters, when operating on random time- varying graph signals (or
random graph processes) over random time-varying graphs. Our analysis shows
that (i) in expectation, the filters behave as the same deterministic filters
operating on a deterministic graph, being the expected graph, having as input
signal a deterministic signal, being the expected signal, and (ii) there are
meaningful upper bounds for the variance of the filter output. We conclude the
paper by proposing two novel ways of exploiting randomness to improve (joint
graph-time) noise cancellation, as well as to reduce the computational
complexity of graph filtering. As demonstrated by numerical results, these
methods outperform the disjoint average and denoise algorithm, and yield a (up
to) four times complexity redution, with very little difference from the
optimal solution.

 <dc:description>  It has been well recognized that detecting drivable area is central to
self-driving cars. Most of existing methods attempt to locate road surface by
using lane line, thereby restricting to drivable area on which have a clear
lane mark. This paper proposes an unsupervised approach for detecting drivable
area utilizing both image data from a monocular camera and point cloud data
from a 3D-LIDAR scanner. Our approach locates initial drivable areas based on a
&quot;direction ray map&quot; obtained by image-LIDAR data fusion. Besides, a fusion of
the feature level is also applied for more robust performance. Once the initial
drivable areas are described by different features, the feature fusion problem
is formulated as a Markov network and a belief propagation algorithm is
developed to perform the model inference. Our approach is unsupervised and
avoids common hypothesis, yet gets state-of-the-art results on ROAD-KITTI
benchmark. Experiments show that our unsupervised approach is efficient and
robust for detecting drivable area for self-driving cars.

 <dc:title>Autocorrelation Function for Dispersion-Free Fiber Channels with
  Distributed Amplification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kramer, Gerhard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Optical fiber signals with high power exhibit spectral broadening that seems
to limit capacity. To study spectral broadening, the autocorrelation function
of the output signal given the input signal is derived for a simplified fiber
model that has zero dispersion, distributed optical amplification (OA), and
idealized spatial noise processes. The autocorrelation function is used to
upper bound the output power of bandlimited or time-resolution limited
receivers, and thereby to bound spectral broadening and the capacity of
receivers with thermal noise. The output power scales at most as the
square-root of the launch power, and thus capacity scales at most as one-half
the logarithm of the launch power. The propagating signal bandwidth scales at
least as the square-root of the launch power. However, in practice the OA
bandwidth should exceed the signal bandwidth to compensate attenuation. Hence,
there is a launch power threshold beyond which the fiber model loses practical
relevance. Nevertheless, for the mathematical model an upper bound on capacity
is developed when the OA bandwidth scales as the square-root of the launch
power, in which case capacity scales at most as the inverse fourth root of the
launch power.

 <dc:description>Comment: Accepted for publication in the IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory. The main
  changes are in Sec. III-D: the noise (35), which is based on (33), does not
  give jointly Wiener spatial processes that are needed for analysis. However,
  Appendix A points out that the noise in (33) is itself an idealization. We
  suspect that the capacity bounds for the idealized case provide insight on
  the general case</dc:description>

energy systems, realistic testing environments are needed. Due to the
dimensions of a real-world environment a field-based installation is often not
viable. More efficient instead of a local installation is to connect existing
and highly sophisticated labs with different focus of specialization. Today's
experimental setups for the Smart Grid domain are very time-consuming solutions
or specific implementations for a single project. To overcome this challenge,
an innovative concept for a novel approach for large-scale co-simulation across

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a spectrum monitoring framework for the detection
of radar signals in spectrum sharing scenarios. The core of our framework is a
deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model that enables Measurement Capable
Devices to identify the presence of radar signals in the radio spectrum, even
when these signals are overlapped with other sources of interference, such as
commercial LTE and WLAN. We collected a large dataset of RF measurements, which
include the transmissions of multiple radar pulse waveforms, downlink LTE,
WLAN, and thermal noise. We propose a pre-processing data representation that
leverages the amplitude and phase shifts of the collected samples. This
representation allows our CNN model to achieve a classification accuracy of
99.6% on our testing dataset. The trained CNN model is then tested under
various SNR values, outperforming other models, such as spectrogram-based CNN
models.

 <dc:description>  High-resolution three-dimensional (3D) cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a valuable medical imaging technique, but its widespread application
in clinical practice is hampered by long acquisition times. Here we present a
novel compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction approach using shearlets as a
sparsifying transform allowing for fast 3D CMR (3DShearCS). Shearlets are
mathematically optimal for a simplified model of natural images and have been
proven to be more efficient than classical systems such as wavelets. Data is
acquired with a 3D Radial Phase Encoding (RPE) trajectory and an iterative
reweighting scheme is used during image reconstruction to ensure fast
convergence and high image quality. In our in-vivo cardiac MRI experiments we
show that the proposed method 3DShearCS has lower relative errors and higher
structural similarity compared to the other reconstruction techniques
especially for high undersampling factors, i.e. short scan times. In this
paper, we further show that 3DShearCS provides improved depiction of cardiac
anatomy (measured by assessing the sharpness of coronary arteries) and two
clinical experts qualitatively analyzed the image quality.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces speech-based visual question answering (VQA), the task
of generating an answer given an image and a spoken question. Two methods are
studied: an end-to-end, deep neural network that directly uses audio waveforms
as input versus a pipelined approach that performs ASR (Automatic Speech
Recognition) on the question, followed by text-based visual question answering.
Furthermore, we investigate the robustness of both methods by injecting various
levels of noise into the spoken question and find both methods to be tolerate
noise at similar levels.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose novel gossip algorithms for decentralized subspace
learning problems that are modeled as finite sum problems on the Grassmann
manifold. Interesting applications in this setting include low-rank matrix
completion and multi-task feature learning, both of which are naturally
reformulated in the considered setup. To exploit the finite sum structure, the
problem is distributed among different agents and a novel cost function is
proposed that is a weighted sum of the tasks handled by the agents and the
communication cost among the agents. The proposed modeling approach allows
local subspace learning by different agents while achieving asymptotic
consensus on the global learned subspace. The resulting approach is scalable
and parallelizable. Our numerical experiments show the good performance of the
proposed algorithms on various benchmarks, e.g., the Netflix dataset.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study how to learn stochastic, multimodal transition
dynamics in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. We focus on evaluating
transition function estimation, while we defer planning over this model to
future work. Stochasticity is a fundamental property of many task environments.
However, discriminative function approximators have difficulty estimating
multimodal stochasticity. In contrast, deep generative models do capture
complex high-dimensional outcome distributions. First we discuss why, amongst
such models, conditional variational inference (VI) is theoretically most
appealing for model-based RL. Subsequently, we compare different VI models on
their ability to learn complex stochasticity on simulated functions, as well as
on a typical RL gridworld with multimodal dynamics. Results show VI
successfully predicts multimodal outcomes, but also robustly ignores these for
deterministic parts of the transition dynamics. In summary, we show a robust
method to learn multimodal transitions using function approximation, which is a
key preliminary for model-based RL in stochastic domains.

 <dc:title>Fronthaul Quantization as Artificial Noise for Enhanced Secret
  Communication in C-RAN</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This work considers the downlink of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN), in
which a control unit (CU) encodes confidential messages, each of which is
intended for a user equipment (UE) and is to be kept secret from all the other
UEs. As per the C-RAN architecture, the encoded baseband signals are quantized
and compressed prior to the transfer to distributed radio units (RUs) that are
connected to the CU via finite-capacity fronthaul links. This work argues that
the quantization noise introduced by fronthaul quantization can be leveraged to
act as &quot;artificial&quot; noise in order to enhance the rates achievable under
secrecy constraints. To this end, it is proposed to control the statistics of
the quantization noise by applying multivariate, or joint, fronthaul
quantization/compression at the CU across all outgoing fronthaul links.
Assuming wiretap coding, the problem of jointly optimizing the precoding and
multivariate compression strategies, along with the covariance matrices of
artificial noise signals generated by RUs, is formulated with the goal of
maximizing the weighted sum of achievable secrecy rates while satisfying per-RU
fronthaul capacity and power constraints. After showing that the artificial
noise covariance matrices can be set to zero without loss of optimaliy, an
iterative optimization algorithm is derived based on the concave convex
procedure (CCCP), and some numerical results are provided to highlight the
advantages of leveraging quantization noise as artificial noise.

 <dc:description>  Most recent CNN architectures use average pooling as a final feature encoding
step. In the field of fine-grained recognition, however, recent global
representations like bilinear pooling offer improved performance. In this
paper, we generalize average and bilinear pooling to &quot;alpha-pooling&quot;, allowing
for learning the pooling strategy during training. In addition, we present a
novel way to visualize decisions made by these approaches. We identify parts of
training images having the highest influence on the prediction of a given test
image. It allows for justifying decisions to users and also for analyzing the
influence of semantic parts. For example, we can show that the higher capacity
VGG16 model focuses much more on the bird's head than, e.g., the lower-capacity
VGG-M model when recognizing fine-grained bird categories. Both contributions
allow us to analyze the difference when moving between average and bilinear
pooling. In addition, experiments show that our generalized approach can
outperform both across a variety of standard datasets.

 <dc:title>Outage analysis in two-way communication with RF energy harvesting relay

 <dc:description>  The study of relays with the scope of energy-harvesting (EH) looks
interesting as a means of enabling sustainable, wireless communication without
the need to recharge or replace the battery driving the relays. However,
reliability of such communication systems becomes an important design challenge
when such relays scavenge energy from the information bearing RF signals
received from the source, using the technique of simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT). To this aim, this work studies
bidirectional communication in a decode-and-forward (DF) relay assisted
cooperative wireless network in presence of co-channel interference (CCI). In
order to quantify the reliability of the bidirectional communication systems, a
closed form expression for the outage probability of the system is derived for
both power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) mode of operation of the
relay. Simulation results are used to validate the accuracy of our analytical
results and illustrate the dependence of the outage probability on various
system parameters, like PS factor, TS factor, and distance of the relay from
both the users. Results of performance comparison between PS relaying (PSR) and
TS relaying (TSR) schemes are also presented. Besides, simulation results are
also used to illustrate the spectral-efficiency and the energy-efficiency of
the proposed system. The results show that, both in terms of spectral
efficiency and the energy-efficiency, the two-way communication system in
presence of moderate CCI power, performs better than the similar system without
CCI. Additionally, it is also found that PSR is superior to TSR protocol in
terms of peak energy-efficiency.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new multi-carrier system, called orthogonal code-based
block transmission (OCBT). OCBT applies a time-spreading method with an
orthogonal code to have a block signal structure and a windowing procedure to
reduce the out-of-band (OOB) radiation. The proposed OCBT can transmit the
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signals to use the conventional multiple
input multiple output techniques. Numerical results show that the proposed OCBT
using QAM signal has the short burst compared to the filter-bank multi-carrier
(FBMC), the low complexity compared to FBMC and windowed orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (W-OFDM) and also the low OOB radiation compared to OFDM.

 <dc:description>  Facebook, the most popular Online social network is a virtual environment
where users share information and are in contact with friends. Apart from many
useful aspects, there is a large amount of personal and sensitive information
publicly available that is accessible to external entities/users. In this paper
we study the public exposure of Facebook profile attributes to understand what
type of attributes are considered more sensitive by Facebook users in terms of
privacy, and thus are rarely disclosed, and which attributes are available in
most Facebook profiles. Furthermore, we also analyze the public exposure of
Facebook users by accounting the number of attributes that users make publicly
available on average. To complete our analysis we have crawled the profile
information of 479K randomly selected Facebook users. Finally, in order to
demonstrate the utility of the publicly available information in Facebook
profiles we show in this paper three case studies. The first one carries out a
gender-based analysis to understand whether men or women share more or less
information. The second case study depicts the age distribution of Facebook
users. The last case study uses data inferred from Facebook profiles to map the
distribution of worldwide population across cities according to its size.

 <dc:description>  Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) pose new challenges to verification and
validation that go beyond the proof of functional correctness based on
high-level models. Particular challenges are, in particular for formal methods,
its heterogeneity and scalability. For numerical simulation, uncertain behavior
can hardly be covered in a comprehensive way which motivates the use of
symbolic methods.
  The paper describes an approach for symbolic simulation-based verification of
CPS with uncertainties. We define a symbolic model and representation of
uncertain computations: Affine Arithmetic Decision Diagrams. Then we integrate
this approach in the SystemC AMS simulator that supports simulation in
different models of computation. We demonstrate the approach by analyzing a
water-level monitor with uncertainties, self-diagnosis, and error-reactions.

 <dc:description>  The Residual Quantization (RQ) framework is revisited where the quantization
distortion is being successively reduced in multi-layers. Inspired by the
reverse-water-filling paradigm in rate-distortion theory, an efficient
regularization on the variances of the codewords is introduced which allows to
extend the RQ for very large numbers of layers and also for high dimensional
data, without getting over-trained. The proposed Regularized Residual
Quantization (RRQ) results in multi-layer dictionaries which are additionally
sparse, thanks to the soft-thresholding nature of the regularization when
applied to variance-decaying data which can arise from de-correlating
transformations applied to correlated data. Furthermore, we also propose a
general-purpose pre-processing for natural images which makes them suitable for
such quantization. The RRQ framework is first tested on synthetic
variance-decaying data to show its efficiency in quantization of
high-dimensional data. Next, we use the RRQ in super-resolution of a database
of facial images where it is shown that low-resolution facial images from the
test set quantized with codebooks trained on high-resolution images from the
training set show relevant high-frequency content when reconstructed with those
codebooks.

 <dc:title>Over-Approximation of Fluid Models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tschaikowski, Max</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Fluid models are a popular formalism in the quantitative modeling of
biochemical systems and analytical performance models. The main idea is to
approximate a large-scale Markov chain by a compact set of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs). Even though it is often crucial for a fluid
model under study to satisfy some given properties, a formal verification is
usually challenging. This is because parameters are often not known precisely
due to finite-precision measurements and stochastic noise. In this paper, we
present a novel technique that allows one to efficiently compute formal bounds
on the reachable set of time-varying nonlinear ODE systems that are subject to
uncertainty. To this end, we a) relate the reachable set of a nonlinear fluid
model to a family of inhomogeneous continuous time Markov decision processes
and b) provide optimal and suboptimal solutions for the family by relying on
optimal control theory. We argue that our approach does not suffer from the
curse of dimensionality and demonstrate its scalability and the tightness of
its bounds by comparing it with a state-of-the-art over-approximation
technique.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new residual convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture for single image depth estimation. Compared with existing deep CNN
based methods, our method achieves much better results with fewer training
examples and model parameters. The advantages of our method come from the usage
of dilated convolution, skip connection architecture and soft-weight-sum
inference. Experimental evaluation on the NYU Depth V2 dataset shows that our
method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a margin.

 <dc:description>  We present consensus analysis of systems with single integrator dynamics
interacting via time-varying graphs under the event-triggered control paradigm.
Event-triggered control sparsifies the control applied, thus reducing the
control effort expended. Initially, we consider a multi-agent system with
persistently exciting interactions and study the behaviour under the
application of event-triggered control with two types of trigger functions-
static and dynamic trigger.We show that while in the case of static trigger,
the edge-states converge to a ball around the origin, the dynamic trigger
function forces the states to reach consensus exponentially. Finally, we extend
these results to a more general setting where we consider switching topologies.
We show that similar results can be obtained for agents interacting via
switching topologies and validate our results by means of simulations.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The capacity of cellular networks can be improved by the unprecedented array
gain and spatial multiplexing offered by Massive MIMO. Since its inception, the
coherent interference caused by pilot contamination has been believed to create
a finite capacity limit, as the number of antennas goes to infinity. In this
paper, we prove that this is incorrect and an artifact from using simplistic
channel models and suboptimal precoding/combining schemes. We show that with
multicell MMSE precoding/combining and a tiny amount of spatial channel
correlation or large-scale fading variations over the array, the capacity
increases without bound as the number of antennas increases, even under pilot
contamination. More precisely, the result holds when the channel covariance
matrices of the contaminating users are asymptotically linearly independent,
which is generally the case. If also the diagonals of the covariance matrices
are linearly independent, it is sufficient to know these diagonals (and not the
full covariance matrices) to achieve an unlimited asymptotic capacity.

 <dc:description>  Machine vision for plant phenotyping is an emerging research area for
producing high throughput in agriculture and crop science applications. Since
2D based approaches have their inherent limitations, 3D plant analysis is
becoming state of the art for current phenotyping technologies. We present an
automated system for analyzing plant growth in indoor conditions. A gantry
robot system is used to perform scanning tasks in an automated manner
throughout the lifetime of the plant. A 3D laser scanner mounted as the robot's
payload captures the surface point cloud data of the plant from multiple views.
The plant is monitored from the vegetative to reproductive stages in light/dark
cycles inside a controllable growth chamber. An efficient 3D reconstruction
algorithm is used, by which multiple scans are aligned together to obtain a 3D
mesh of the plant, followed by surface area and volume computations. The whole
system, including the programmable growth chamber, robot, scanner, data
transfer and analysis is fully automated in such a way that a naive user can,
in theory, start the system with a mouse click and get back the growth analysis
results at the end of the lifetime of the plant with no intermediate
intervention. As evidence of its functionality, we show and analyze
quantitative results of the rhythmic growth patterns of the dicot Arabidopsis
thaliana(L.), and the monocot barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) plants under their
diurnal light/dark cycles.

 <dc:description>  When aggregating preferences of agents via voting, two desirable goals are to
incentivize agents to participate in the voting process and then identify
outcomes that are Pareto efficient. We consider participation as formalized by
Brandl, Brandt, and Hofbauer (2015) based on the stochastic dominance (SD)
relation. We formulate a new rule called RMEC (Rank Maximal Equal Contribution)
that satisfies the strongest notion of participation and is also ex post
efficient. The rule is polynomial-time computable and also satisfies many other
desirable fairness properties. The rule suggests a general approach to
achieving ex post efficiency and very strong participation.

 <dc:description>  The vast amount of data and increase of computational capacity have allowed
the analysis of texts from several perspectives, including the representation
of texts as complex networks. Nodes of the network represent the words, and
edges represent some relationship, usually word co-occurrence. Even though
networked representations have been applied to study some tasks, such
approaches are not usually combined with traditional models relying upon
statistical paradigms. Because networked models are able to grasp textual
patterns, we devised a hybrid classifier, called labelled subgraphs, that
combines the frequency of common words with small structures found in the
topology of the network, known as motifs. Our approach is illustrated in two
contexts, authorship attribution and translationese identification. In the
former, a set of novels written by different authors is analyzed. To identify
translationese, texts from the Canadian Hansard and the European parliament
were classified as to original and translated instances. Our results suggest
that labelled subgraphs are able to represent texts and it should be further
explored in other tasks, such as the analysis of text complexity, language
proficiency, and machine translation.

 <dc:title>Performance tradeoffs of dynamically controlled grid-connected inverters

 <dc:description>  Implementing frequency response using grid-connected inverters is one of the
popular proposed alternatives to mitigate the dynamic degradation experienced
in low inertia power systems. However, such solution faces several challenges
as inverters do not intrinsically possess the natural response to power
fluctuations that synchronous generators have. Thus, to synthetically generate
this response, inverters need to take frequency measurements, which are usually
noisy, and subsequently make changes in the output power, which are therefore
delayed. This paper explores the system-wide performance tradeoffs that arise
when measurement noise, power disturbances, and delayed actions are considered
in the design of dynamic controllers for grid-connected inverters. Using a
recently proposed dynamic droop (iDroop) control for grid-connected inverters,
which is inspired by classical first order lead-lag compensation, we show that
the sets of parameters that result in highest noise attenuation, power
disturbance mitigation, and delay robustness do not necessarily have a common
intersection. In particular, lead compensation is desired in systems where
power disturbances are the predominant source of degradation, while lag
compensation is a better alternative when the system is dominated by delays or
frequency noise. Our analysis further shows that iDroop can outperform the
standard droop alternative in both joint noise and disturbance mitigation, and
delay robustness.

 <dc:description>  Today's Internet traffic is mostly dominated by multimedia content and the
prediction is that this trend will intensify in the future. Therefore, main
Internet players, such as ISPs, content delivery platforms (e.g. Youtube,
Bitorrent, Netflix, etc) or CDN operators, need to understand the evolution of
multimedia content availability and popularity in order to adapt their
infrastructures and resources to satisfy clients requirements while they
minimize their costs. This paper presents a thorough analysis on the evolution
of multimedia content available in BitTorrent. Specifically, we analyze the
evolution of four relevant metrics across different content categories: content
availability, content popularity, content size and user's feedback. To this end
we leverage a large-scale dataset formed by 4 snapshots collected from the most
popular BitTorrent portal, namely The Pirate Bay, between Nov. 2009 and Feb.
2012. Overall our dataset is formed by more than 160k content that attracted
more than 185M of download sessions.

 <dc:description>  The Logic Programming through Prolog has been widely used for supply
persistence in many systems that need store knowledge. Some implementations of
Prolog Programming Language used for supply persistence have bidirectional
interfaces with other programming languages over all with Object Oriented
Programing Languages. In present days is missing tools and frameworks for the
systems development that use logic predicate persistence in easy and agile
form. More specifically an object oriented and logic persistence provider is
need in present days that allow the object manipulation in main memory and the
persistence for this objects have a Logic Programming predicates aspect. The
present work introduce an object-prolog declarative mappings alternative to
support by an object oriented and logic persistence provider. The proposed
alternative consists in a correspondence of the Logic Programming predicates
with an Object Oriented approach, where for each element of the Logic
Programming one Object Oriented element makes to reciprocate. The Object
Oriented representation of Logic Programming predicates offers facility of
manipulation on the elements that compose a knowledge.

 <dc:description>  Application programming interfaces (APIs) offer a plethora of functionalities
for developers to reuse without reinventing the wheel. Identifying the
appropriate APIs given a project requirement is critical for the success of a
project, as many functionalities can be reused to achieve faster development.
However, the massive number of APIs would often hinder the developers' ability
to quickly find the right APIs. In this light, we propose a new, automated
approach called WebAPIRec that takes as input a project profile and outputs a
ranked list of {web} APIs that can be used to implement the project. At its
heart, WebAPIRec employs a personalized ranking model that ranks web APIs
specific (personalized) to a project. Based on the historical data of {web} API
usages, WebAPIRec learns a model that minimizes the incorrect ordering of web
APIs, i.e., when a used {web} API is ranked lower than an unused (or a
not-yet-used) web API. We have evaluated our approach on a dataset comprising
9,883 web APIs and 4,315 web application projects from ProgrammableWeb with
promising results. For 84.0% of the projects, WebAPIRec is able to successfully
return correct APIs that are used to implement the projects in the top-5
positions. This is substantially better than the recommendations provided by
ProgrammableWeb's native search functionality. WebAPIRec also outperforms
McMillan et al.'s application search engine and popularity-based
recommendation.

 <dc:description>  Cooperative map matching (CMM) uses the Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) position information of a group of vehicles to improve the standalone
localization accuracy. It has been shown, in our previous work, that the GNSS
error can be reduced from several meters to sub-meter level by matching the
biased GNSS positioning to a digital map with road constraints. While further
error reduction is expected by increasing the number of participating vehicles,
fundamental questions on how the vehicle membership within CMM affects the
performance of the CMM results need to be addressed to provide guidelines for
design and optimization of the vehicle network. This work presents a
theoretical study that establishes a framework for quantitative evaluation of
the impact of the road constraints on the CMM accuracy. More specifically, a
closed-form expression of the CMM error in terms of the road constraints and
GNSS error is derived based on a simple CMM rule. The asymptotic decay of the
CMM error as the number of vehicles increases is established and justified
through numerical simulations. Moreover, it is proved that the CMM error can be
minimized if the directions of the roads on which the connected vehicles travel
obey a uniform distribution. Finally, the localization accuracy of CMM is
evaluated based on the Safety Pilot Model Deployment and Pillar dataset of Ann
Arbor traffic flow collected over three years period. The contributions of this
work include establishing a theoretical foundation for CMM as well as providing
insight and motivation for applications of CMM.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes our participation in Task 5 track 2 of SemEval 2017 to
predict the sentiment of financial news headlines for a specific company on a
continuous scale between -1 and 1. We tackled the problem using a number of
approaches, utilising a Support Vector Regression (SVR) and a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM). We found an improvement of 4-6% using the LSTM
model over the SVR and came fourth in the track. We report a number of
different evaluations using a finance specific word embedding model and reflect
on the effects of using different evaluation metrics.

 <dc:description>  Learning a better representation with neural networks is a challenging
problem, which was tackled extensively from different prospectives in the past
few years. In this work, we focus on learning a representation that could be
used for a clustering task and introduce two novel loss components that
substantially improve the quality of produced clusters, are simple to apply to
an arbitrary model and cost function, and do not require a complicated training
procedure. We evaluate them on two most common types of models, Recurrent
Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks, showing that the approach we
propose consistently improves the quality of KMeans clustering in terms of
Adjusted Mutual Information score and outperforms previously proposed methods.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we argue why and how the integration of recommender systems
for research can enhance the functionality and user experience in repositories.
We present the latest technical innovations in the CORE Recommender, which
provides research article recommendations across the global network of
repositories and journals. The CORE Recommender has been recently redeveloped
and released into production in the CORE system and has also been deployed in
several third-party repositories. We explain the design choices of this unique
system and the evaluation processes we have in place to continue raising the
quality of the provided recommendations. By drawing on our experience, we
discuss the main challenges in offering a state-of-the-art recommender solution
for repositories. We highlight two of the key limitations of the current
repository infrastructure with respect to developing research recommender
systems: 1) the lack of a standardised protocol and capabilities for exposing
anonymised user-interaction logs, which represent critically important input
data for recommender systems based on collaborative filtering and 2) the lack
of a voluntary global sign-on capability in repositories, which would enable
the creation of personalised recommendation and notification solutions based on
past user interactions.

 <dc:description>  Although the problem of automatic video summarization has recently received a
lot of attention, the problem of creating a video summary that also highlights
elements relevant to a search query has been less studied. We address this
problem by posing query-relevant summarization as a video frame subset
selection problem, which lets us optimise for summaries which are
simultaneously diverse, representative of the entire video, and relevant to a
text query. We quantify relevance by measuring the distance between frames and
queries in a common textual-visual semantic embedding space induced by a neural
network. In addition, we extend the model to capture query-independent
properties, such as frame quality. We compare our method against previous state
of the art on textual-visual embeddings for thumbnail selection and show that
our model outperforms them on relevance prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a
new dataset, annotated with diversity and query-specific relevance labels. On
this dataset, we train and test our complete model for video summarization and
show that it outperforms standard baselines such as Maximal Marginal Relevance.

 <dc:description>  Next generation wireless architectures are expected to enable slices of
shared wireless infrastructure which are customized to specific mobile
operators/services. Given infrastructure costs and stochastic nature of mobile
services' spatial loads, it is highly desirable to achieve efficient
statistical multiplexing amongst network slices. We study a simple dynamic
resource sharing policy which allocates a 'share' of a pool of (distributed)
resources to each slice- Share Constrained Proportionally Fair (SCPF). We give
a characterization of the achievable performance gains over static slicing,
showing higher gains when a slice's spatial load is more 'imbalanced' than,
and/or 'orthogonal' to, the aggregate network load. Under SCPF, traditional
network dimensioning translates to a coupled share dimensioning problem,
addressing the existence of a feasible share allocation given slices' expected
loads and performance requirements. We provide a solution to robust share
dimensioning for SCPF-based network slicing. Slices may wish to unilaterally
manage their users' performance via admission control which maximizes their
carried loads subject to performance requirements. We show this can be modeled
as a &quot;traffic shaping&quot; game with an achievable Nash equilibrium. Under high
loads, the equilibrium is explicitly characterized, as are the gains in the
carried load under SCPF vs. static slicing. Detailed simulations of a wireless
infrastructure supporting multiple slices with heterogeneous mobile loads show
the fidelity of our models and range of validity of our high load equilibrium
analysis.

 <dc:description>  The gradual deployment of intelligent and coordinated devices in the
electrical power system needs careful investigation of the interactions between
the various domains involved. Especially due to the coupling between ICT and
power systems a holistic approach for testing and validating is required.
Taking existing (quasi-) standardised smart grid system and test specification
methods as a starting point, we are developing a holistic testing and
validation approach that allows a very flexible way of assessing the system
level aspects by various types of experiments (including virtual, real, and
mixed lab settings). This paper describes the formal holistic test case
specification method and applies it to a particular co-simulation experimental
setup. The various building blocks of such a simulation (i.e., FMI, mosaik,
domain-specific simulation federates) are covered in more detail. The presented
method addresses most modeling and specification challenges in cyber-physical
energy systems and is extensible for future additions such as uncertainty
quantification.

 <dc:description>  Active networks driven by local energy conversion are ubiquitous in nature,
yet little is known about how information propagates through these
far-from-equilibrium systems. Through a mathematical analogy with spin-ice
vertex models, we investigate here the input-output characteristics of generic
incompressible active flow networks (AFNs). Our analysis shows that information
transport through an AFN is inherently different from conventional pressure or
voltage driven networks. Active flows on hexagonal arrays preserve input
information over longer distances than their passive counterparts and are
highly sensitive to bulk topological defects, which can be inferred
holographically from marginal input-output distributions. This sensitivity
further allows controlled permutations on parallel inputs, revealing an
unexpected link between active matter and group theory that can guide new
microfluidic mixing strategies facilitated by active matter and aid the design
of generic autonomous information transport networks.

 <dc:description>  While artificial intelligence (AI) has become widespread, many commercial AI
systems are not yet accessible to individual researchers nor the general public
due to the deep knowledge of the systems required to use them. We believe that
AI has matured to the point where it should be an accessible technology for
everyone. We present an ongoing project whose ultimate goal is to deliver an
open source, user-friendly AI system that is specialized for machine learning
analysis of complex data in the biomedical and health care domains. We discuss
how genetic programming can aid in this endeavor, and highlight specific
examples where genetic programming has automated machine learning analyses in
previous projects.

 <dc:description>  We present and evaluate a technique for computing path-sensitive interference
conditions during abstract interpretation of concurrent programs. In lieu of
fixed point computation, we use prime event structures to compactly represent
causal dependence and interference between sequences of transformers. Our main
contribution is an unfolding algorithm that uses a new notion of independence
to avoid redundant transformer application, thread-local fixed points to reduce
the size of the unfolding, and a novel cutoff criterion based on subsumption to
guarantee termination of the analysis. Our experiments show that the abstract
unfolding produces an order of magnitude fewer false alarms than a mature
abstract interpreter, while being several orders of magnitude faster than
solver-based tools that have the same precision.

 <dc:title>Feature-Sharing in Cascade Detection Systems with Multiple Applications</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Traditional distributed detection systems are often designed for a single
target application. However, with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT)
paradigm, next-generation systems are expected to be a shared infrastructure
for multiple applications. To this end, we propose a modular, cascade design
for resource-efficient, multi-task detection systems. Two (classes of)
applications are considered in the system, a primary and a secondary one. The
primary application has universal features that can be shared with other
applications, to reduce the overall feature extraction cost, while the
secondary application does not. In this setting, the two applications can
collaborate via feature sharing. We provide a method to optimize the operation
of the multi-application cascade system based on an accurate resource
consumption model. In addition, the inherent uncertainties in feature models
are articulated and taken into account. For evaluation, the twin-comparison
argument is invoked, and it is shown that, with the optimal feature sharing
strategy, a system can achieve 9$\times$ resource saving and 1.43$\times$
improvement in detection performance.

 <dc:description>  Semi-supervised learning plays an important role in large-scale machine
learning. Properly using additional unlabeled data (largely available nowadays)
often can improve the machine learning accuracy. However, if the machine
learning model is misspecified for the underlying true data distribution, the
model performance could be seriously jeopardized. This issue is known as model
misspecification. To address this issue, we focus on generative models and
propose a criterion to detect the onset of model misspecification by measuring
the performance difference between models obtained using supervised and
semi-supervised learning. Then, we propose to automatically modify the
generative models during model training to achieve an unbiased generative
model. Rigorous experiments were carried out to evaluate the proposed method
using two image classification data sets PASCAL VOC'07 and MIR Flickr. Our
proposed method has been demonstrated to outperform a number of
state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning approaches for the classification
task.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we make a simple observation that questions about images often
contain premises - objects and relationships implied by the question - and that
reasoning about premises can help Visual Question Answering (VQA) models
respond more intelligently to irrelevant or previously unseen questions. When
presented with a question that is irrelevant to an image, state-of-the-art VQA
models will still answer purely based on learned language biases, resulting in
non-sensical or even misleading answers. We note that a visual question is
irrelevant to an image if at least one of its premises is false (i.e. not
depicted in the image). We leverage this observation to construct a dataset for
Question Relevance Prediction and Explanation (QRPE) by searching for false
premises. We train novel question relevance detection models and show that
models that reason about premises consistently outperform models that do not.
We also find that forcing standard VQA models to reason about premises during
training can lead to improvements on tasks requiring compositional reasoning.

 <dc:description>  As image tampering becomes ever more sophisticated and commonplace, the need
for image forensics algorithms that can accurately and quickly detect forgeries
grows. In this paper, we revisit the ideas of image querying and retrieval to
provide clues to better localize forgeries. We propose a method to perform
large-scale image forensics on the order of one million images using the help
of an image search algorithm and database to gather contextual clues as to
where tampering may have taken place. In this vein, we introduce five new
strongly invariant image comparison methods and test their effectiveness under
heavy noise, rotation, and color space changes. Lastly, we show the
effectiveness of these methods compared to passive image forensics using Nimble
[https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/nimble-challenge], a new, state-of-the-art
dataset from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

 <dc:description>  We study a mini-batch diversification scheme for stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). While classical SGD relies on uniformly sampling data points to form a
mini-batch, we propose a non-uniform sampling scheme based on the Determinantal
Point Process (DPP). The DPP relies on a similarity measure between data points
and gives low probabilities to mini-batches which contain redundant data, and
higher probabilities to mini-batches with more diverse data. This
simultaneously balances the data and leads to stochastic gradients with lower
variance. We term this approach Diversified Mini-Batch SGD (DM-SGD). We show
that regular SGD and a biased version of stratified sampling emerge as special
cases. Furthermore, DM-SGD generalizes stratified sampling to cases where no
discrete features exist to bin the data into groups. We show experimentally
that our method results more interpretable and diverse features in unsupervised
setups, and in better classification accuracies in supervised setups.

 <dc:description>  In domain adaptation, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has been widely adopted
as a discrepancy metric between the distributions of source and target domains.
However, existing MMD-based domain adaptation methods generally ignore the
changes of class prior distributions, i.e., class weight bias across domains.
This remains an open problem but ubiquitous for domain adaptation, which can be
caused by changes in sample selection criteria and application scenarios. We
show that MMD cannot account for class weight bias and results in degraded
domain adaptation performance. To address this issue, a weighted MMD model is
proposed in this paper. Specifically, we introduce class-specific auxiliary
weights into the original MMD for exploiting the class prior probability on
source and target domains, whose challenge lies in the fact that the class
label in target domain is unavailable. To account for it, our proposed weighted
MMD model is defined by introducing an auxiliary weight for each class in the
source domain, and a classification EM algorithm is suggested by alternating
between assigning the pseudo-labels, estimating auxiliary weights and updating
model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
weighted MMD over conventional MMD for domain adaptation.

 <dc:title>Guided-Processing Outperforms Duty-Cycling for Energy-Efficient Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Energy-efficiency is highly desirable for sensing systems in the Internet of
Things (IoT). A common approach to achieve low-power systems is duty-cycling,
where components in a system are turned off periodically to meet an energy
budget. However, this work shows that such an approach is not necessarily
optimal in energy-efficiency, and proposes \textit{guided-processing} as a
fundamentally better alternative. The proposed approach offers 1) explicit
modeling of performance uncertainties in system internals, 2) a realistic
resource consumption model, and 3) a key insight into the superiority of
guided-processing over duty-cycling. Generalization from the cascade structure
to the more general graph-based one is also presented. Once applied to optimize
a large-scale audio sensing system with a practical detection application,
empirical results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the
detection performance (up to $1.7\times$ and $4\times$ reduction in false-alarm
and miss rate, respectively) for the same energy consumption, when compared to
the duty-cycling approach.

 <dc:description>  The identification of the minimal set of nodes that maximizes the propagation
of information is one of the most important problems in network science. In
this paper, we introduce a new method to find the set of initial spreaders to
maximize the information propagation in complex networks. We evaluate this
method in assortative networks and verify that degree-degree correlation plays
a fundamental role on the spreading dynamics. Simulation results show that our
algorithm is statistically similar, in terms of the average size of outbreaks,
to the greedy approach. However, our method is much less time consuming than
the greedy algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of estimating a signal from noisy
circularly-translated versions of itself, called multireference alignment
(MRA). One natural approach to MRA could be to estimate the shifts of the
observations first, and infer the signal by aligning and averaging the data. In
contrast, we consider a method based on estimating the signal directly, using
features of the signal that are invariant under translations. Specifically, we
estimate the power spectrum and the bispectrum of the signal from the
observations. Under mild assumptions, these invariant features contain enough
information to infer the signal. In particular, the bispectrum can be used to
estimate the Fourier phases. To this end, we propose and analyze a few
algorithms. Our main methods consist of non-convex optimization over the smooth
manifold of phases. Empirically, in the absence of noise, these non-convex
algorithms appear to converge to the target signal with random initialization.
The algorithms are also robust to noise. We then suggest three additional
methods. These methods are based on frequency marching, semidefinite relaxation
and integer programming. The first two methods provably recover the phases
exactly in the absence of noise. In the high noise level regime, the invariant
features approach for MRA results in stable estimation if the number of
measurements scales like the cube of the noise variance, which is the
information-theoretic rate. Additionally, it requires only one pass over the
data which is important at low signal-to-noise ratio when the number of
observations must be large.

 <dc:description>  Automatic fake news detection is a challenging problem in deception
detection, and it has tremendous real-world political and social impacts.
However, statistical approaches to combating fake news has been dramatically
limited by the lack of labeled benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present
liar: a new, publicly available dataset for fake news detection. We collected a
decade-long, 12.8K manually labeled short statements in various contexts from
PolitiFact.com, which provides detailed analysis report and links to source
documents for each case. This dataset can be used for fact-checking research as
well. Notably, this new dataset is an order of magnitude larger than previously
largest public fake news datasets of similar type. Empirically, we investigate
automatic fake news detection based on surface-level linguistic patterns. We
have designed a novel, hybrid convolutional neural network to integrate
meta-data with text. We show that this hybrid approach can improve a text-only
deep learning model.

natural language response suggestion. Feed-forward neural networks using n-gram
embedding features encode messages into vectors which are optimized to give
message-response pairs a high dot-product value. An optimized search finds
response suggestions. The method is evaluated in a large-scale commercial

approach, the new system achieves the same quality at a small fraction of the
computational requirements and latency.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we investigate the value of uncertainty modeling in 3D
super-resolution with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Deep learning has
shown success in a plethora of medical image transformation problems, such as
super-resolution (SR) and image synthesis. However, the highly ill-posed nature
of such problems results in inevitable ambiguity in the learning of networks.
We propose to account for intrinsic uncertainty through a per-patch
heteroscedastic noise model and for parameter uncertainty through approximate
Bayesian inference in the form of variational dropout. We show that the
combined benefits of both lead to the state-of-the-art performance SR of
diffusion MR brain images in terms of errors compared to ground truth. We
further show that the reduced error scores produce tangible benefits in
downstream tractography. In addition, the probabilistic nature of the methods
naturally confers a mechanism to quantify uncertainty over the super-resolved
output. We demonstrate through experiments on both healthy and pathological
brains the potential utility of such an uncertainty measure in the risk
assessment of the super-resolved images for subsequent clinical use.

 <dc:description>  We propose a software architecture designed to ease the implementation of
dialogue systems. The Modular Architecture for Conversational Agents (MACA)
uses a plug-n-play style that allows quick prototyping, thereby facilitating
the development of new techniques and the reproduction of previous work. The
architecture separates the domain of the conversation from the agent's dialogue
strategy, and as such can be easily extended to multiple domains. MACA provides
tools to host dialogue agents on Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk) for data
collection and allows processing of other sources of training data. The current
version of the framework already incorporates several domains and existing
dialogue strategies from the recent literature.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: The architecture needs to be tested further. Sorry for the
  inconvenience. We should be putting up the paper up soon</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of reserving link capacity in a network in such a way
that any of a given set of flow scenarios can be supported. In the optimal
capacity reservation problem, we choose the reserved link capacities to
minimize the reservation cost. This problem reduces to a large linear program,
with the number of variables and constraints on the order of the number of
links times the number of scenarios. Small and medium size problems are within
the capabilities of generic linear program solvers. We develop a more scalable,
distributed algorithm for the problem that alternates between solving (in
parallel) one flow problem per scenario, and coordination steps, which connect
the individual flows and the reservation capacities.

 <dc:description>  Many similarity-based clustering methods work in two separate steps including
similarity matrix computation and subsequent spectral clustering. However,
similarity measurement is challenging because it is usually impacted by many
factors, e.g., the choice of similarity metric, neighborhood size, scale of
data, noise and outliers. Thus the learned similarity matrix is often not
suitable, let alone optimal, for the subsequent clustering. In addition,
nonlinear similarity often exists in many real world data which, however, has
not been effectively considered by most existing methods. To tackle these two
challenges, we propose a model to simultaneously learn cluster indicator matrix
and similarity information in kernel spaces in a principled way. We show
theoretical relationships to kernel k-means, k-means, and spectral clustering
methods. Then, to address the practical issue of how to select the most
suitable kernel for a particular clustering task, we further extend our model
with a multiple kernel learning ability. With this joint model, we can
automatically accomplish three subtasks of finding the best cluster indicator
matrix, the most accurate similarity relations and the optimal combination of
multiple kernels. By leveraging the interactions between these three subtasks
in a joint framework, each subtask can be iteratively boosted by using the
results of the others towards an overall optimal solution. Extensive
experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

 <dc:description>  Sparse arrays can generate a larger aperture than traditional uniform linear
arrays (ULA) and offer enhanced degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) which can be
exploited in both beamforming and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. One
class of sparse arrays is the coprime array, composed of two uniform linear
subarrays which yield an effective difference co-array with higher number of
DOFs. In this work, we present a new coprime array structure termed thinned
coprime array (TCA), which exploits the redundancy in the structure of the
existing coprime array and achieves the same virtual aperture and DOFs as the
conventional coprime array with much fewer number of sensors. An analysis of
the DOFs provided by the new structure in comparison with other sparse arrays
is provided and simulation results for DOA estimation using the compressive
sensing based method are provided.

 <dc:title>Proactive Population-Risk Based Defense Against Denial of Cyber-Physical

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  While the Internet of things (IoT) promises to improve areas such as energy
efficiency, health care, and transportation, it is highly vulnerable to
cyberattacks. In particular, DDoS attacks work by overflowing the bandwidth of
a server. But many IoT devices form part of cyber-physical systems (CPS).
Therefore, they can be used to launch a &quot;physical&quot; denial-of-service attack
(PDoS) in which IoT devices overflow the &quot;physical bandwidth&quot; of a CPS. In this
paper, we quantify the population-based risk to a group of IoT devices targeted
by malware for a PDoS attack. To model the recruitment of bots, we extend a
traditional game-theoretic concept and create a &quot;Poisson signaling game.&quot; Then
we analyze two different mechanisms (legal and economic) to deter botnet
recruitment. We find that 1) defenders can bound botnet activity and 2)
legislating a minimum level of security has only a limited effect, while
incentivizing active defense can decrease botnet activity arbitrarily. This
work provides a quantitative foundation for designing proactive defense against
PDoS attacks.

 <dc:description>  Sparse additive modeling is a class of effective methods for performing
high-dimensional nonparametric regression. In this work we show how shape
constraints such as convexity/concavity and their extensions, can be integrated
into additive models. The proposed sparse difference of convex additive models
(SDCAM) can estimate most continuous functions without any a priori smoothness
assumption. Motivated by a characterization of difference of convex functions,
our method incorporates a natural regularization functional to avoid
overfitting and to reduce model complexity. Computationally, we develop an
efficient backfitting algorithm with linear per-iteration complexity.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data verify that our method is
competitive against state-of-the-art sparse additive models, with improved
performance in most scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Lambek calculus is a logical foundation of categorial grammar, a linguistic
paradigm of grammar as logic and parsing as deduction. Pentus (2010) gave a
polynomial-time algorithm for determ- ining provability of bounded depth
formulas in the Lambek calculus with empty antecedents allowed. Pentus'
algorithm is based on tabularisation of proof nets. Lambek calculus with
brackets is a conservative extension of Lambek calculus with bracket
modalities, suitable for the modeling of syntactical domains. In this paper we
give an algorithm for provability the Lambek calculus with brackets allowing
empty antecedents. Our algorithm runs in polynomial time when both the formula
depth and the bracket nesting depth are bounded. It combines a Pentus-style
tabularisation of proof nets with an automata-theoretic treatment of
bracketing.

 <dc:description>  In recent studies [1][13][12] Recurrent Neural Networks were used for
generative processes and their surprising performance can be explained by their
ability to create good predictions. In addition, data compression is also based
on predictions. What the problem comes down to is whether a data compressor
could be used to perform as well as recurrent neural networks in natural
language processing tasks. If this is possible,then the problem comes down to
determining if a compression algorithm is even more intelligent than a neural
network in specific tasks related to human language. In our journey we
discovered what we think is the fundamental difference between a Data
Compression Algorithm and a Recurrent Neural Network.

 <dc:description>  Drones equipped with cameras are emerging as a powerful tool for large-scale
aerial 3D scanning, but existing automatic flight planners do not exploit all
available information about the scene, and can therefore produce inaccurate and
incomplete 3D models. We present an automatic method to generate drone
trajectories, such that the imagery acquired during the flight will later
produce a high-fidelity 3D model. Our method uses a coarse estimate of the
scene geometry to plan camera trajectories that: (1) cover the scene as
thoroughly as possible; (2) encourage observations of scene geometry from a
diverse set of viewing angles; (3) avoid obstacles; and (4) respect a
user-specified flight time budget. Our method relies on a mathematical model of
scene coverage that exhibits an intuitive diminishing returns property known as
submodularity. We leverage this property extensively to design a trajectory
planning algorithm that reasons globally about the non-additive coverage reward
obtained across a trajectory, jointly with the cost of traveling between views.
We evaluate our method by using it to scan three large outdoor scenes, and we
perform a quantitative evaluation using a photorealistic video game simulator.

 <dc:title>Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation for Multi-Server
  Mobile-Edge Computing Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Mobile-Edge Computing (MEC) is an emerging paradigm that provides a capillary
distribution of cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the wireless access
network, enabling rich services and applications in close proximity to the end
users. In this article, a MEC enabled multi-cell wireless network is considered
where each Base Station (BS) is equipped with a MEC server that can assist
mobile users in executing computation-intensive tasks via task offloading. The
problem of Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation (JTORA) is studied in
order to maximize the users' task offloading gains, which is measured by the
reduction in task completion time and energy consumption. The considered
problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Non-linear Program (MINLP) that
involves jointly optimizing the task offloading decision, uplink transmission
power of mobile users, and computing resource allocation at the MEC servers.
Due to the NP-hardness of this problem, solving for optimal solution is
difficult and impractical for a large-scale network. To overcome this drawback,
our approach is to decompose the original problem into (i) a Resource
Allocation (RA) problem with fixed task offloading decision and (ii) a Task
Offloading (TO) problem that optimizes the optimal-value function corresponding
to the RA problem. We address the RA problem using convex and quasi-convex
optimization techniques, and propose a novel heuristic algorithm to the TO
problem that achieves a suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Numerical
simulation results show that our algorithm performs closely to the optimal
solution and that it significantly improves the users' offloading utility over
traditional approaches.

OFDP has some serious security, efficiency and functionality limitations that
make it non suitable for production deployments. Instead, we briefly introduce
sOFTD, a new discovery protocol with a built-in security characteristics and
which is more efficient than traditional OFDP.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces {\Delta}Breakpad. It extends the Breakpad crash
reporting system to handle software diversity effectively and efficiently by
replicating and patching the debug information of diversified software
versions. Simple adaptations to existing open source compiler tools are
presented that on the one hand introduce significant amounts of diversification
in the code and stack layout of ARMv7 binaries to mitigate the widespread
deployment of code injection and code reuse attacks, while on the other hand
still supporting accurate crash reporting. An evaluation on SPEC2006 benchmarks
demonstrates that the corresponding computational, storage, and communication
overheads are small.

 <dc:description>  Professional players in social media (e.g., big companies, politician,
athletes, celebrities, etc) are intensively using Online Social Networks (OSNs)
in order to interact with a huge amount of regular OSN users with different
purposes (marketing campaigns, customer feedback, public reputation
improvement, etc). Hence, due to the large catalog of existing OSNs,
professional players usually count with OSN accounts in different systems. In
this context an interesting question is whether professional users publish the
same information across their OSN accounts, or actually they use different OSNs
in a different manner. We define as cross-posting activity the action of
publishing the same information in two or more OSNs. This paper aims at
characterizing the cross-posting activity of professional users across three
major OSNs, Facebook, Twitter and Google+. To this end, we perform a
large-scale measurement-based analysis across more than 2M posts collected from
616 professional users with active accounts in the three referred OSNs. Then we
characterize the phenomenon of cross posting and analyze the behavioral
patterns based on the identified characteristics.

 <dc:description>  Facebook is today the most popular social network with more than one billion
subscribers worldwide. To provide good quality of service (e.g., low access
delay) to their clients, FB relies on Akamai, which provides a worldwide
content distribution network with a large number of edge servers that are much
closer to FB subscribers. In this article we aim to depict a global picture of
the current FB network infrastructure deployment taking into account both
native FB servers and Akamai nodes. Toward this end, we have performed a
measurement-based analysis during a period of two weeks using 463 Planet- Lab
nodes distributed across 41 countries. Based on the obtained data we compare
the average access delay that nodes in different countries experience accessing
both native FB servers and Akamai nodes. In addition, we obtain a wide view of
the deployment of Akamai nodes serving FB users worldwide. Finally, we analyze
the geographical coverage of those nodes, and demonstrate that in most of the
cases Akamai nodes located in a particular country service not only local FB
subscribers, but also FB users located in nearby countries.

 <dc:description>  The computation of the tropical prevariety is the first step in the
application of polyhedral methods to compute positive dimensional solution sets
of polynomial systems. In particular, pretropisms are candidate leading
exponents for the power series developments of the solutions. The computation
of the power series may start as soon as one pretropism is available, so our
parallel computation of the tropical prevariety has an application in a
pipelined solver.
  We present a parallel implementation of dynamic enumeration. Our first
distributed memory implementation with forked processes achieved good speedups,
but quite often resulted in large variations in the execution times of the
processes. The shared memory multithreaded version applies work stealing to
reduce the variability of the run time. Our implementation applies the thread
safe Parma Polyhedral Library (PPL), in exact arithmetic with the GNU
Multiprecision Arithmetic Library (GMP), aided by the fast memory allocations
of TCMalloc.
  Our parallel implementation is capable of computing the tropical prevariety
of the cyclic 16-roots problem. We also report on computational experiments on
the $n$-body and $n$-vortex problems; our computational results compare
favorably with Gfan.

 <dc:title>Optimum Decoder for Multiplicative Spread Spectrum Image Watermarking

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the multiplicative spread spectrum watermarking
method for the image. The information bit is spreaded into middle-frequency
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of each block of an image using a
generated pseudo-random sequence. Unlike the conventional signal modeling, we
suppose that both signal and noise are distributed with Laplacian distribution
because the sample loss of digital media can be better modeled with this
distribution than the Gaussian one. We derive the optimum decoder for the
proposed embedding method thanks to the maximum likelihood decoding scheme. We
also analyze our watermarking system in the presence of noise and provide
analytical evaluations and several simulations. The results show that it has
the suitable performance and transparency required for watermarking
applications.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new supervised classification algorithm for remotely
sensed hyperspectral image (HSI) which integrates spectral and spatial
information in a unified Bayesian framework. First, we formulate the HSI
classification problem from a Bayesian perspective. Then, we adopt a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the posterior class distributions
using a patch-wise training strategy to better use the spatial information.
Next, spatial information is further considered by placing a spatial smoothness
prior on the labels. Finally, we iteratively update the CNN parameters using
stochastic gradient decent (SGD) and update the class labels of all pixel
vectors using an alpha-expansion min-cut-based algorithm. Compared with other
state-of-the-art methods, the proposed classification method achieves better
performance on one synthetic dataset and two benchmark HSI datasets in a number
of experimental settings.

 <dc:description>  The increase of connectivity and the impact it has in every day life is
raising new and existing security problems that are becoming important for
social good. We introduce two particular problems: cyber attack attribution and
regulatory data sharing. For both problems, decisions about which rules to
apply, should be taken under incomplete and context dependent information. The
solution we propose is based on argumentation reasoning, that is a well suited
technique for implementing decision making mechanisms under conflicting and
incomplete information. Our proposal permits us to identify the attacker of a
cyber attack and decide the regulation rule that should be used while using and
sharing data. We illustrate our solution through concrete examples.

 <dc:description>  Multi-label text classification is a popular machine learning task where each
document is assigned with multiple relevant labels. This task is challenging
due to high dimensional features and correlated labels. Multi-label text
classifiers need to be carefully regularized to prevent the severe over-fitting
in the high dimensional space, and also need to take into account label
dependencies in order to make accurate predictions under uncertainty. We
demonstrate significant and practical improvement by carefully regularizing the
model complexity during training phase, and also regularizing the label search
space during prediction phase. Specifically, we regularize the classifier
training using Elastic-net (L1+L2) penalty for reducing model complexity/size,
and employ early stopping to prevent overfitting. At prediction time, we apply
support inference to restrict the search space to label sets encountered in the
training set, and F-optimizer GFM to make optimal predictions for the F1
metric. We show that although support inference only provides density
estimations on existing label combinations, when combined with GFM predictor,
the algorithm can output unseen label combinations. Taken collectively, our
experiments show state of the art results on many benchmark datasets. Beyond
performance and practical contributions, we make some interesting observations.
Contrary to the prior belief, which deems support inference as purely an
approximate inference procedure, we show that support inference acts as a
strong regularizer on the label prediction structure. It allows the classifier
to take into account label dependencies during prediction even if the
classifiers had not modeled any label dependencies during training.

 <dc:description>  Multi-class supervised learning systems require the knowledge of the entire
range of labels they predict. Often when learnt incrementally, they suffer from
catastrophic forgetting. To avoid this, generous leeways have to be made to the
philosophy of incremental learning that either forces a part of the machine to
not learn, or to retrain the machine again with a selection of the historic
data. While these hacks work to various degrees, they do not adhere to the
spirit of incremental learning. In this article, we redefine incremental
learning with stringent conditions that do not allow for any undesirable
relaxations and assumptions. We design a strategy involving generative models
and the distillation of dark knowledge as a means of hallucinating data along
with appropriate targets from past distributions. We call this technique,
phantom sampling.We show that phantom sampling helps avoid catastrophic
forgetting during incremental learning. Using an implementation based on deep
neural networks, we demonstrate that phantom sampling dramatically avoids
catastrophic forgetting. We apply these strategies to competitive multi-class
incremental learning of deep neural networks. Using various benchmark datasets
and through our strategy, we demonstrate that strict incremental learning could
be achieved. We further put our strategy to test on challenging cases,
including cross-domain increments and incrementing on a novel label space. We
also propose a trivial extension to unbounded-continual learning and identify
potential for future development.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently emerged intelligent assistants on smartphones and home electronics
(e.g., Siri and Alexa) can be seen as novel hybrids of domain-specific
task-oriented spoken dialogue systems and open-domain non-task-oriented ones.
To realize such hybrid dialogue systems, this paper investigates determining
whether or not a user is going to have a chat with the system. To address the
lack of benchmark datasets for this task, we construct a new dataset consisting
of 15; 160 utterances collected from the real log data of a commercial
intelligent assistant (and will release the dataset to facilitate future
research activity). In addition, we investigate using tweets and Web search
queries for handling open-domain user utterances, which characterize the task
of chat detection. Experiments demonstrated that, while simple supervised
methods are effective, the use of the tweets and search queries further
improves the F1-score from 86.21 to 87.53.

 <dc:description>  In order to develop provably safe human-in-the-loop systems, accurate and
precise models of human behavior must be developed. In the case of intelligent
vehicles, one can imagine the need for predicting driver behavior to develop
minimally invasive active safety systems or to safely interact with other
vehicles on the road. We present a optimization based method for approximating
the stochastic reachable set for human-in-the-loop systems. This method
identifies the most precise subset of states that a human driven vehicle may
enter, given some dataset of observed trajectories. We phrase this problem as a
mixed integer linear program, which can be solved using branch and bound
methods. The resulting model uncovers the most representative subset that
encapsulates the likely trajectories, up to some probability threshold, by
optimally rejecting outliers in the dataset. This tool provides set predictions
consisting of trajectories observed from the nonlinear dynamics and behaviors
of the human driven car, and can account for modes of behavior, like the driver
state or intent. This allows us to predict driving behavior over long time
horizons with high accuracy. By using this realistic data and flexible
algorithm, a precise and accurate driver model can be developed to capture
likely behaviors. The resulting prediction can be tailored to an individual for
use in semi-autonomous frameworks or generally applied for autonomous planning
in interactive maneuvers.

 <dc:description>  While end-to-end neural machine translation (NMT) has made remarkable
progress recently, it still suffers from the data scarcity problem for
low-resource language pairs and domains. In this paper, we propose a method for
zero-resource NMT by assuming that parallel sentences have close probabilities
of generating a sentence in a third language. Based on this assumption, our
method is able to train a source-to-target NMT model (&quot;student&quot;) without
parallel corpora available, guided by an existing pivot-to-target NMT model
(&quot;teacher&quot;) on a source-pivot parallel corpus. Experimental results show that
the proposed method significantly improves over a baseline pivot-based model by
+3.0 BLEU points across various language pairs.

 <dc:description>  Most natural videos contain numerous events. For example, in a video of a
&quot;man playing a piano&quot;, the video might also contain &quot;another man dancing&quot; or &quot;a
crowd clapping&quot;. We introduce the task of dense-captioning events, which
involves both detecting and describing events in a video. We propose a new
model that is able to identify all events in a single pass of the video while
simultaneously describing the detected events with natural language. Our model
introduces a variant of an existing proposal module that is designed to capture
both short as well as long events that span minutes. To capture the
dependencies between the events in a video, our model introduces a new
captioning module that uses contextual information from past and future events
to jointly describe all events. We also introduce ActivityNet Captions, a
large-scale benchmark for dense-captioning events. ActivityNet Captions
contains 20k videos amounting to 849 video hours with 100k total descriptions,
each with it's unique start and end time. Finally, we report performances of
our model for dense-captioning events, video retrieval and localization.

 <dc:description>  Clustering is an important data mining technique that groups similar data
records, recently categorical transaction clustering is received more
attention. In this research, we study the problem of categorical data
clustering for transactional data characterized with high dimensionality and
large volume. We propose a novel algorithm for clustering transactional data
called F-Tree, which is based on the idea of the frequent pattern algorithm
FP-tree; the fastest approaches to the frequent item set mining. And the simple
idea behind the F-Tree is to generate small high pure clusters, and then merge
them. That makes it fast, and dynamic in clustering large transactional
datasets with high dimensions. We also present a new solution to solve the
overlapping problem between clusters, by defining a new criterion function,
which is based on the probability of overlapping between weighted items. Our
experimental evaluation on real datasets shows that: Firstly, F-Tree is
effective in finding interesting clusters. Secondly, the usage of the tree
structure reduces the clustering process time of the large data set with high
attributes. Thirdly, the proposed evaluation metric used efficiently to solve
the overlapping of transaction items generates high-quality clustering results.
Finally, we have concluded that the process of merging pure and small clusters
increases the purity of resulted clusters as well as it reduces the time of
clustering better than the process of generating clusters directly from dataset
then refine clusters.

 <dc:description>  Unlike compressive sensing where the measurement outputs are assumed to be
real-valued and have infinite precision, in &quot;one-bit compressive sensing&quot;,
measurements are quantized to one bit, their signs. In this work, we show how
to recover the support of sparse high-dimensional vectors in the one-bit
compressive sensing framework with an asymptotically near-optimal number of
measurements. We also improve the bounds on the number of measurements for
approximately recovering vectors from one-bit compressive sensing measurements.
Our results are universal, namely the same measurement scheme works
simultaneously for all sparse vectors.
  Our proof of optimality for support recovery is obtained by showing an
equivalence between the task of support recovery using 1-bit compressive
sensing and a well-studied combinatorial object known as Union Free Families.

 <dc:description>  Authentication is one of the essential security services in Wireless Sensor
Networks (WSNs) for ensuring secure data sessions. Sensor node authentication
ensures the confidentiality and validity of data collected by the sensor node,
whereas user authentication guarantees that only legitimate users can access
the sensor data. In a mobile WSN, sensor and user nodes move across the network
and exchange data with multiple nodes, thus experiencing the authentication
process multiple times. The integration of WSNs with Internet of Things (IoT)
brings forth a new kind of WSN architecture along with stricter security
requirements; for instance, a sensor node or a user node may need to establish
multiple concurrent secure data sessions. With concurrent data sessions, the
frequency of the re-authentication process increases in proportion to the
number of concurrent connections, which makes the security issue even more
challenging. The currently available authentication protocols were designed for
the autonomous WSN and do not account for the above requirements. In this
paper, we present a novel, lightweight and efficient key exchange and
authentication protocol suite called the Secure Mobile Sensor Network (SMSN)
Authentication Protocol. In the SMSN a mobile node goes through an initial
authentication procedure and receives a re-authentication ticket from the base
station. Later a mobile node can use this re-authentication ticket when
establishing multiple data exchange sessions and/or when moving across the
network. This scheme reduces the communication and computational complexity of
the authentication process. We proved the strength of our protocol with
rigorous security analysis and simulated the SMSN and previously proposed
schemes in an automated protocol verifier tool. Finally, we compared the
computational complexity and communication cost against well-known
authentication protocols.

 <dc:description>  This volume contains the proceedings of the Fourteenth International Workshop
on the ACL2 Theorem Prover and Its Applications, ACL2 2017, a two-day workshop
held in Austin, Texas, USA, on May 22-23, 2017. ACL2 workshops occur at
approximately 18-month intervals, and they provide a technical forum for
researchers to present and discuss improvements and extensions to the theorem
prover, comparisons of ACL2 with other systems, and applications of ACL2 in
formal verification.
  ACL2 is a state-of-the-art automated reasoning system that has been
successfully applied in academia, government, and industry for specification
and verification of computing systems and in teaching computer science courses.
Boyer, Kaufmann, and Moore were awarded the 2005 ACM Software System Award for
their work on ACL2 and the other theorem provers in the Boyer-Moore
theorem-prover family.
  The proceedings of ACL2 2017 include the seven technical papers and two
extended abstracts that were presented at the workshop. Each submission
received two or three reviews. The workshop also included three invited talks:
&quot;Using Mechanized Mathematics in an Organization with a Simulation-Based
Mentality&quot;, by Glenn Henry of Centaur Technology, Inc.; &quot;Formal Verification of
Financial Algorithms, Progress and Prospects&quot;, by Grant Passmore of Aesthetic
Integration; and &quot;Verifying Oracle's SPARC Processors with ACL2&quot; by Greg
Grohoski of Oracle. The workshop also included several rump sessions discussing
ongoing research and the use of ACL2 within industry.

 <dc:description>  Fabrication-less design houses outsource their designs to 3rd party foundries
to lower fabrication cost. However, this creates opportunities for a rogue in
the foundry to introduce hardware Trojans, which stay inactive most of the time
and cause unintended consequences to the system when triggered. Hardware
Trojans in traditional CMOS-based circuits have been studied and
Design-for-Trust (DFT) techniques have been proposed to detect them.
  Different from traditional circuits in many ways, reversible circuits
implement one-to-one, bijective input/output mappings. We will investigate the
security implications of reversible circuits with a particular focus on
susceptibility to hardware Trojans. We will consider inherently reversible
circuits and non-reversible functions embedded in reversible circuits.

 <dc:title>Aligned Image Sets and the Generalized Degrees of Freedom of Symmetric

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) of the two user symmetric multiple
input multiple output (MIMO) interference channel (IC) are characterized as a
function of the channel strength levels and the level of channel state
information at the transmitters (CSIT). In this symmetric setting, each
transmitter is equipped with M antennas, each receiver is equipped with N
antennas, and both cross links have the same strength parameter $\alpha$ and
the same channel uncertainty parameter $\beta$. The main challenge resides in
the proof of the outer bound which is accomplished by a generalization of the
aligned image sets approach.

constacyclic codes to be Galois LCD codes are characterized. Some illustrative

well. In particular, we study Hermitian LCD constacyclic codes. Finally, we
present a construction of a class of Hermitian LCD codes which are also MDS

 <dc:description>  We propose an automatic diabetic retinopathy (DR) analysis algorithm based on
two-stages deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). Compared to existing
DCNN-based DR detection methods, the proposed algorithm have the following
advantages: (1) Our method can point out the location and type of lesions in
the fundus images, as well as giving the severity grades of DR. Moreover, since
retina lesions and DR severity appear with different scales in fundus images,
the integration of both local and global networks learn more complete and
specific features for DR analysis. (2) By introducing imbalanced weighting map,
more attentions will be given to lesion patches for DR grading, which
significantly improve the performance of the proposed algorithm. In this study,
we label 12,206 lesion patches and re-annotate the DR grades of 23,595 fundus
images from Kaggle competition dataset. Under the guidance of clinical
ophthalmologists, the experimental results show that our local lesion detection
net achieve comparable performance with trained human observers, and the
proposed imbalanced weighted scheme also be proved to significantly improve the
capability of our DCNN-based DR grading algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We propose two algorithms for solving a graph partitioning problem motivated
by computational topology. Specifically, given a weighted, undirected graph $G$
and a positive integer $k$, we desire to find $k$ disjoint trees within $G$
such that each vertex of $G$ is contained in one of the trees and the weight of
largest tree is as small as possible. We are unable to find this problem in the
graph partitioning literature, but we show that the problem is NP-complete.
  We propose two approximation algorithms, one that uses a spectral clustering
approach and another that employs a dynamic programming strategy, that produce
near-optimal partitions on a family of test graphs. We describe these
algorithms and analyze their empirical performance.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we make an investigation on the sum-mean-square-error
(sum-MSE) performance gain achieved by DFT-based least-square (LS) channel
estimator over frequency-domain LS one in full-duplex OFDM system in the
presence of colored interference and noise. The closed-form expression of the
sum-MSE performance gain is given. Its simple upper and lower bounds are
derived by using inequalities of matrix eigen-values. By simulation and
analysis, the upper lower bound is shown to be close to the exact value of MSE
gain as the ratio of the number N of total subcarriers to the cyclic prefix
length L grows and the correlation factor of colored interference increases.
More importantly, we also find that the MSE gain varies from one to N/L as the
correlation among colored interferences decreases gradually. According to
theoretical analysis, we also find the MSE gain has very simple forms in two
extreme scenarios. In the first extreme case that the colored interferences
over all subchannels are fully correlated, i.e., their covariance matrix is a
matrix of all-ones, the sum-MSE gain reduces to 1. In other words, there is no
performance gain. In the second extreme case that the colored-interference
covariance matrix is an identity matrix, i.e, they are mutually independent,
the achievable sum-MSE performance gain is N/L. A large ratio N/L will achieve
a significant sum-MSE gain.

 <dc:description>  We present the first automated privacy analysis of STAR-Vote, a real world
voting system design with sophisticated &quot;end-to-end&quot; cryptography, using FDR
and ProVerif. We also evaluate the effectiveness of these tools. Despite the
complexity of the voting system, we were able to verify that our abstracted
formal model of STAR-Vote provides ballot-secrecy using both formal approaches.
Notably, ProVerif is radically faster than FDR, making it more suitable for
rapid iteration and refinement of the formal model.

 <dc:description>  Social robots need to understand the affective state of the humans with whom
they interact. Successful interactions require understanding mood and emotion
in the short term, and personality and attitudes over longer periods. Social
robots should also be able to infer the desires, wishes, and preferences of
humans without being explicitly told.
  We investigate how effectively affective state can be inferred from corpora
in which documents are plausible surrogates for what a robot might hear. For
mood, emotions, wishes, desires, and attitudes we show highly ranked documents;
for personality dimensions, estimates of ground truth are available and we
report performance accuracy. The results are surprisingly strong given the
limited information in short documents.

 <dc:title>Automated Analysis of Voting Systems under an Active Intruder Model in
  CSP</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Moran, Murat</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Heather, James</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This article presents a novel intruder model for automated reasoning about
anonymity (vote-privacy) and secrecy properties of voting systems. We adapt the
lazy spy for this purpose, as it avoids the eagerness of pre-computation of
unnecessary deductions, reducing the required state space for the analysis.
This powerful intruder behaves as a Dolev-Yao intruder, which not only observes
a protocol run but also interacts with the protocol participants, overhears
communication channels, intercepts and spoofs any messages that he has learned
or generated from any prior knowledge.
  We make several important modifications in relation to existing channel types
and the deductive system. For the former, we define various channel types for
different threat models. For the latter, we construct a large deductive system
over the space of messages transmitted in the voting system model. The model
represents the first formal treatment of the vVote system, which was used in
November 2014, in state elections in Victoria, Australia.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we presented a novel semi-supervised one-class classification
algorithm which assumes that class is linearly separable from other elements.
We proved theoretically that class is linearly separable if and only if it is
maximal by probability within the sets with the same mean. Furthermore, we
presented an algorithm for identifying such linearly separable class utilizing
linear programming. We described three application cases including an
assumption of linear separability, Gaussian distribution, and the case of
linear separability in transformed space of kernel functions. Finally, we
demonstrated the work of the proposed algorithm on the USPS dataset and
analyzed the relationship of the performance of the algorithm and the size of
the initially labeled sample.

 <dc:title>Fisher Information Maximization for Distributed Vector Estimation in
  Wireless Sensor Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the problem of distributed estimation of a Gaussian
vector with linear observation model in a wireless sensor network (WSN). Each
sensor employs a uniform multi-bit quantizer to quantize its noisy observation,
maps it to a digitally modulated symbol, and transmits the symbol over
power-constrained wireless channels (subject to fading and noise) to a fusion
center (FC), which is tasked with fusing the received signals and estimating
the unknown vector. We derive the Bayesian Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) from
the collectively received signals at the FC, and also, mean square error (MSE)
of linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator. Our derivations reveal
how these two metrics depend on the observation model and its parameters,
including observation noise as well as quantizer, and the physical layer
parameters (e.g., channel gain, channel noise, transmit power, and quantization
bits). Moreover, we consider two problems of transmit power allocation schemes
that maximize the trace and log-determinant of FIM under total network power
constraint (FI-max schemes). In our simulations, we compare the system
performance using the solutions of such schemes, with that of uniform power
allocation scheme, in which, for the given total network power, all power is
uniformly allocated among all sensors. Our simulations demonstrate the superior
performances of FI-max schemes. Furthermore, we investigate how the power
allocation depends on the sensors observation qualities and physical layer
parameters and on the total transmit power constraint. A comparison will also
be made between the performances of coherent and noncoherent reception
techniques.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of estimating the $L_1$ distance between two discrete
probability measures $P$ and $Q$ from empirical data in a nonasymptotic and
large alphabet setting. When $Q$ is known and one obtains $n$ samples from $P$,
we show that for every $Q$, the minimax rate-optimal estimator with $n$ samples
achieves performance comparable to that of the maximum likelihood estimator
(MLE) with $n\ln n$ samples. When both $P$ and $Q$ are unknown, we construct
minimax rate-optimal estimators whose worst case performance is essentially
that of the known $Q$ case with $Q$ being uniform, implying that $Q$ being
uniform is essentially the most difficult case. The effective sample size
enlargement phenomenon, identified in Jiao et al. (2015), holds both in the
known $Q$ case for every $Q$ and the $Q$ unknown case. However, the
construction of optimal estimators for $L_1(P,Q)$ requires new techniques and
insights beyond the Approximation methodology of functional estimation in Jiao
et al. (2015).

 <dc:description>  In this paper we determine the class of quantum states whose density matrix
representation can be derived from graph Laplacian matrices associated with a
weighted directed graph and we call them graph Laplacian quantum states. Then
we obtain structural properties of these graphs such that the corresponding
graph Laplacian states have zero quantum discord by investigating structural
properties of clustered graphs which provide a family of commuting normal
matrices formed by the blocks of its Laplacian matrices. We apply these results
on some important mixed quantum states, such as the Werner, Isotropic, and
$X$-states.

 <dc:description>  Once a failure is observed, the primary concern of the developer is to
identify what caused it in order to repair the code that induced the incorrect
behavior. Until a permanent repair is afforded, code repair patches are
invaluable. The aim of this work is to devise an automated patch generation
technique that proceeds as follows: Step1) It identifies a set of
failure-causing control dependence chains that are minimal in terms of number
and length. Step2) It identifies a set of predicates within the chains along
with associated execution instances, such that negating the predicates at the
given instances would exhibit correct behavior. Step3) For each candidate
predicate, it creates a classifier that dictates when the predicate should be
negated to yield correct program behavior. Step4) Prior to each candidate
predicate, the faulty program is injected with a call to its corresponding
classifier passing it the program state and getting a return value predictively
indicating whether to negate the predicate or not. The role of the classifiers
is to ensure that: 1) the predicates are not negated during passing runs; and
2) the predicates are negated at the appropriate instances within failing runs.
We implemented our patch generation approach for the Java platform and
evaluated our toolset using 148 defects from the Introclass and Siemens
benchmarks. The toolset identified 56 full patches and another 46 partial
patches, and the classification accuracy averaged 84%.

 <dc:title>Transforming Bell's Inequalities into State Classifiers with Machine

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Quantum information science has profoundly changed the ways we understand,
store, and process information. A major challenge in this field is to look for
an efficient means for classifying quantum state. For instance, one may want to
determine if a given quantum state is entangled or not. However, the process of
a complete characterization of quantum states, known as quantum state
tomography, is a resource-consuming operation in general. An attractive
proposal would be the use of Bell's inequalities as an entanglement witness,
where only partial information of the quantum state is needed. The problem is
that entanglement is necessary but not sufficient for violating Bell's
inequalities, making it an unreliable state classifier. Here we aim at solving
this problem by the methods of machine learning. More precisely, given a family
of quantum states, we randomly picked a subset of it to construct a
quantum-state classifier, accepting only partial information of each quantum
state. Our results indicated that these transformed Bell-type inequalities can
perform significantly better than the original Bell's inequalities in
classifying entangled states. We further extended our analysis to three-qubit
and four-qubit systems, performing classification of quantum states into
multiple species. These results demonstrate how the tools in machine learning
can be applied to solving problems in quantum information science.

prime deficiencies and is based on developed computationally inexpensive
stacking sequences reconstruction algorithm, which identically satisfies
conventional set of blending rules. We combine it with proposed tight
approximation to feasible domain of composite integral parameters and
hierarchical zoning procedure to get highly efficient optimization methodology,
which we test in two example applications. In both cases it is shown that
blending rules compliant optimal solution remains within 10% gap from one with
no rules applied.

 <dc:description>  Motivated with the concept of transform learning and the utility of rational
wavelet transform in audio and speech processing, this paper proposes Rational
Wavelet Transform Learning in Statistical sense (RWLS) for natural images. The
proposed RWLS design is carried out via lifting framework and is shown to have
a closed form solution. The efficacy of the learned transform is demonstrated
in the application of compressed sensing (CS) based reconstruction. The learned
RWLS is observed to perform better than the existing standard dyadic wavelet
transforms.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, automatic generation of image descriptions (captions), that
is, image captioning, has attracted a great deal of attention. In this paper,
we particularly consider generating Japanese captions for images. Since most
available caption datasets have been constructed for English language, there
are few datasets for Japanese. To tackle this problem, we construct a
large-scale Japanese image caption dataset based on images from MS-COCO, which
is called STAIR Captions. STAIR Captions consists of 820,310 Japanese captions
for 164,062 images. In the experiment, we show that a neural network trained
using STAIR Captions can generate more natural and better Japanese captions,
compared to those generated using English-Japanese machine translation after
generating English captions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multi-view high-dimensional data become increasingly popular in the big data
era. Feature selection is a useful technique for alleviating the curse of
dimensionality in multi-view learning. In this paper, we study unsupervised
feature selection for multi-view data, as class labels are usually expensive to
obtain. Traditional feature selection methods are mostly designed for
single-view data and cannot fully exploit the rich information from multi-view
data. Existing multi-view feature selection methods are usually based on noisy
cluster labels which might not preserve sufficient information from multi-view
data. To better utilize multi-view information, we propose a method, CDMA-FS,
to select features for each view by performing alignment on a cross diffused
matrix. We formulate it as a constrained optimization problem and solve it
using Quasi-Newton based method. Experiments results on four real-world
datasets show that the proposed method is more effective than the

 <dc:description>  We propose a hybrid model of differential privacy that considers a
combination of regular and opt-in users who desire the differential privacy
guarantees of the local privacy model and the trusted curator model,
respectively. We demonstrate that within this model, it is possible to design a
new type of blended algorithm for the task of privately computing the head of a
search log. This blended approach provides significant improvements in the
utility of obtained data compared to related work while providing users with
their desired privacy guarantees. Specifically, on two large search click data
sets, comprising 1.75 and 16 GB respectively, our approach attains NDCG values
exceeding 95% across a range of privacy budget values.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning techniques are being used in skeleton based action recognition
tasks and outstanding performance has been reported. Compared with RNN based
methods which tend to overemphasize temporal information, CNN-based approaches
can jointly capture spatio-temporal information from texture color images
encoded from skeleton sequences. There are several skeleton-based features that
have proven effective in RNN-based and handcrafted-feature-based methods.
However, it remains unknown whether they are suitable for CNN-based approaches.
This paper proposes to encode five spatial skeleton features into images with
different encoding methods. In addition, the performance implication of
different joints used for feature extraction is studied. The proposed method
achieved state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D dataset for 3D human action
analysis. An accuracy of 75.32\% was achieved in Large Scale 3D Human Activity
Analysis Challenge in Depth Videos.

 <dc:description>  We generalize the notions of singularities and ordinary points from linear
ordinary differential equations to D-finite systems. Ordinary points of a
D-finite system are characterized in terms of its formal power series
solutions. We also show that apparent singularities can be removed like in the
univariate case by adding suitable additional solutions to the system at hand.
Several algorithms are presented for removing and detecting apparent
singularities. In addition, an algorithm is given for computing formal power
series solutions of a D-finite system at apparent singularities.

 <dc:description>  Incomplete data are often represented as vectors with filled missing
attributes joined with flag vectors indicating missing components. In this
paper we generalize this approach and represent incomplete data as pointed
affine subspaces. This allows to perform various affine transformations of
data, as whitening or dimensionality reduction. We embed such generalized
missing data into a vector space by mapping pointed affine subspace
(generalized missing data point) to a vector containing imputed values joined
with a corresponding projection matrix. Such an operation preserves the scalar
product of the embedding defined for flag vectors and allows to input
transformed incomplete data to typical classification methods.

 <dc:description>  We present the first direct tableau decision procedure with the ExpTime
complexity for HPDL (Hybrid Propositional Dynamic Logic). It checks whether a
given ABox (a finite set of assertions) in HPDL is satisfiable. Technically, it
combines global caching with checking fulfillment of eventualities and dealing
with nominals. Our procedure contains enough details for direct implementation
and has been implemented for the TGC2 (Tableaux with Global Caching) system. As
HPDL can be used as a description logic for representing and reasoning about
terminological knowledge, our procedure is useful for practical applications.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the average complexity on the number of comparisons for
sorting algorithms. Its information-theoretic lower bound is $n \lg n - 1.4427n
+ O(\log n)$. For many efficient algorithms, the first $n\lg n$ term is easy to
achieve and our focus is on the (negative) constant factor of the linear term.
The current best value is $-1.3999$ for the MergeInsertion sort. Our new value
is $-1.4106$, narrowing the gap by some $25\%$. An important building block of
our algorithm is &quot;two-element insertion,&quot; which inserts two numbers $A$ and
$B$, $A&lt;B$, into a sorted sequence $T$. This insertion algorithm is still
sufficiently simple for rigorous mathematical analysis and works well for a
certain range of the length of $T$ for which the simple binary insertion does
not, thus allowing us to take a complementary approach with the binary
insertion.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning has become a powerful and popular tool for a variety of machine
learning tasks. However, it is extremely challenging to understand the
mechanism of deep learning from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we
study robustness of a deep network in its generalization capability against
removal of a certain number of connections between layers. A critical value of
this number is observed to separate a robust (redundant) regime from a
sensitive regime. This empirical behavior is captured qualitatively by a random
active path model, where the path from input to output is randomly and
independently constructed. The empirical critical value corresponds to
termination of a paramagnetic phase in the random active path model.
Furthermore, this model provides us qualitative understandings about
dropconnect probability commonly used in the dropconnect algorithm and its
relationship with the redundancy phenomenon. In addition, we combine the
dropconnect and the random feedback alignment for feedforward and backward pass
in a deep network training respectively, and observe fast learning and improved
test performance in classifying a benchmark handwritten digits dataset.

 <dc:title>Partially-Connected Hybrid Precoding in mm-Wave Systems With Dynamic
  Phase Shifter Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Hybrid precoding is a cost-effective approach to support directional
transmissions for millimeter wave (mm-wave) communications, and its design
challenge mainly lies in the analog component which consists of a network of
phase shifters. The partially-connected structure employs a small number of
phase shifters and therefore serves as an energy efficient solution for hybrid
precoding. In this paper, we propose a double phase shifter (DPS)
implementation for the phase shifter network in the partially-connected
structure, which allows more tractable and flexible hybrid precoder design. In
particular, the hybrid precoder design is identified as an eigenvalue problem.
To further enhance the performance, dynamic mapping from radio frequency (RF)
chains to antennas is proposed, for which a greedy algorithm and a modified
K-means algorithm are developed. Simulation results demonstrate the performance
gains of the proposed hybrid precoding algorithms with the DPS implementation
over existing ones. Given its low hardware complexity and high spectral
efficiency, the proposed structure is a promising candidate for 5G mm-wave
systems.

 <dc:description>  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have provably enhanced the state-of-the-art
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with their capability in modeling complex
functions and capturing complex linguistic structures. However NMT systems with
deep architecture in their encoder or decoder RNNs often suffer from severe
gradient diffusion due to the non-linear recurrent activations, which often
make the optimization much more difficult. To address this problem we propose
novel linear associative units (LAU) to reduce the gradient propagation length
inside the recurrent unit. Different from conventional approaches (LSTM unit
and GRU), LAUs utilizes linear associative connections between input and output
of the recurrent unit, which allows unimpeded information flow through both
space and time direction. The model is quite simple, but it is surprisingly
effective. Our empirical study on Chinese-English translation shows that our
model with proper configuration can improve by 11.7 BLEU upon Groundhog and the
best reported results in the same setting. On WMT14 English-German task and a
larger WMT14 English-French task, our model achieves comparable results with
the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:title>Transfer Learning by Ranking for Weakly Supervised Object Annotation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Most existing approaches to training object detectors rely on fully
supervised learning, which requires the tedious manual annotation of object
location in a training set. Recently there has been an increasing interest in
developing weakly supervised approach to detector training where the object
location is not manually annotated but automatically determined based on binary
(weak) labels indicating if a training image contains the object. This is a
challenging problem because each image can contain many candidate object
locations which partially overlaps the object of interest. Existing approaches
focus on how to best utilise the binary labels for object location annotation.
In this paper we propose to solve this problem from a very different
perspective by casting it as a transfer learning problem. Specifically, we
formulate a novel transfer learning based on learning to rank, which
effectively transfers a model for automatic annotation of object location from
an auxiliary dataset to a target dataset with completely unrelated object
categories. We show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art
weakly supervised approach to annotating objects in the challenging VOC
dataset.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we use Gaussian Process (GP) regression to propose a novel
approach for predicting volatility of financial returns by forecasting the
envelopes of the time series. We provide a direct comparison of their
performance to traditional approaches such as GARCH. We compare the forecasting
power of three approaches: GP regression on the absolute and squared returns;
regression on the envelope of the returns and the absolute returns; and
regression on the envelope of the negative and positive returns separately. We
use a maximum a posteriori estimate with a Gaussian prior to determine our
hyperparameters. We also test the effect of hyperparameter updating at each
forecasting step. We use our approaches to forecast out-of-sample volatility of
four currency pairs over a 2 year period, at half-hourly intervals. From three
kernels, we select the kernel giving the best performance for our data. We use
two published accuracy measures and four statistical loss functions to evaluate
the forecasting ability of GARCH vs GPs. In mean squared error the GP's perform
20% better than a random walk model, and 50% better than GARCH for the same
data.

 <dc:description>  Topological metrics of graphs provide a natural way to describe the prominent
features of various types of networks. Graph metrics describe the structure and
interplay of graph edges and have found applications in many scientific fields.
In this work, the use of graph metrics is employed in network estimation by
developing optimisation methods that incorporate prior knowledge of a network's
topology. The derivatives of graph metrics are used in gradient descent schemes
for weighted undirected network denoising, network decomposition, and network
completion. The successful performance of our methodology is shown in a number
of toy examples and real-world datasets. Most notably, our work establishes a
new link between graph theory, network science and optimisation.

 <dc:description>  A totally new energy harvesting architecture that exploits ambient
electric-field (E-field) emitting from fluorescent light fixtures is presented.
A copper plate, 50 x 50 cm in size, is placed in between the ambient field to
extract energy by capacitive coupling. A low voltage prototype is designed,
structured and tested on a conventional ceiling-type 4-light fluorescent
troffer operating in 50 Hz 220 V AC power grid. It is examined that the
harvester is able to collect roughly 1.25 J of energy in 25 min when a 0.1 F of
super-capacitor is employed. The equivalent circuit and the physical model of
the proposed harvesting paradigm are provided, and the attainable power is
evaluated in both theoretical and experimental manner. The scavenged energy is
planned to be utilized for building battery-less Internet of Things (IoT)
networks that are obliged to sense environmental parameters, analyze the
gathered data, and remotely inform a higher authority within predefined
periods.

 <dc:description>  Pattern matching is a powerful tool which is part of many functional
programming languages as well as computer algebra systems such as Mathematica.
Among the existing systems, Mathematica offers the most expressive pattern
matching. Unfortunately, no open source alternative has comparable pattern
matching capabilities. Notably, these features include support for associative
and/or commutative function symbols and sequence variables. While those
features have individually been subject of previous research, their
comprehensive combination has not yet been investigated. Furthermore, in many
applications, a fixed set of patterns is matched repeatedly against different
subjects. This many-to-one matching can be sped up by exploiting similarities
between patterns. Discrimination nets are the state-of-the-art solution for
many-to-one matching. In this thesis, a generalized discrimination net which
supports the full feature set is presented. All algorithms have been
implemented as an open-source library for Python. In experiments on real world
examples, significant speedups of many-to-one over one-to-one matching have
been observed.

 <dc:title>Full- and Reduced-order Model of Hydraulic Cylinder for Motion Control</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ruderman, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes the full- and reduced-order models of an actuated
hydraulic cylinder suitable for system dynamics analysis and motion control
design. The full-order model incorporates the valve spool dynamics with
combined dead-zone and saturation nonlinearities - inherent for the orifice
flow. It includes the continuity equations of hydraulic circuits coupled with
the dynamics of mechanical part of cylinder drive. The resulted model is the
fifth-order and nonlinear in states. The reduced model neglects the fast valve
spool dynamics, simplifies both the orifice and continuity equations through an
aggregation, and considers the cylinder rod velocity as output of interest. The
reduced model is second-order that facilitates studying the system behavior and
allows for direct phase plane analysis. Dynamics properties are addressed in
details, for both models, with focus on the frequency response, system damping,
and state trajectories related to the load pressure and relative velocity.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  A convolution neural network (CNN) based classification method for broadband
DOA estimation is proposed, where the phase component of the short-time Fourier
transform coefficients of the received microphone signals are directly fed into
the CNN and the features required for DOA estimation are learnt during
training. Since only the phase component of the input is used, the CNN can be
trained with synthesized noise signals, thereby making the preparation of the
training data set easier compared to using speech signals. Through experimental
evaluation, the ability of the proposed noise trained CNN framework to
generalize to speech sources is demonstrated. In addition, the robustness of
the system to noise, small perturbations in microphone positions, as well as
its ability to adapt to different acoustic conditions is investigated using
experiments with simulated and real data.

 <dc:title>Split Packing: Algorithms for Packing Circles with Optimal Worst-Case
  Density</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fekete, S&#xe1;ndor P.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Morr, Sebastian</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Scheffer, Christian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the circle packing problem for triangular containers, one asks whether a
given set of circles can be packed into a given triangle. Packing problems like
this have been shown to be $\mathsf{NP}$-hard. In this paper, we present a new
sufficient condition for packing circles into any right or obtuse triangle
using only the circles' combined area: It is possible to pack any circle
instance whose combined area does not exceed the triangle's incircle. This area
condition is tight, in the sense that for any larger area, there are instances
which cannot be packed.
  A similar result for square containers has been established earlier this
year, using the versatile, divide-and-conquer-based Split Packing algorithm. In
this paper, we present a generalized, weighted version of this approach,
allowing us to construct packings of circles into asymmetric triangles. It
seems crucial to the success of these results that Split Packing does not
depend on an orthogonal subdivision structure. Beside realizing all packings
below the critical density bound, our algorithm can also be used as a
constant-factor approximation algorithm when looking for the smallest non-acute
triangle of a given side ratio in which a given set of circles can be packed.
  An interactive visualization of the Split Packing approach and other related
material can be found at https://morr.cc/split-packing/.

 <dc:description>  Impressive image captioning results are achieved in domains with plenty of
training image and sentence pairs (e.g., MSCOCO). However, transferring to a
target domain with significant domain shifts but no paired training data
(referred to as cross-domain image captioning) remains largely unexplored. We
propose a novel adversarial training procedure to leverage unpaired data in the
target domain. Two critic networks are introduced to guide the captioner,
namely domain critic and multi-modal critic. The domain critic assesses whether
the generated sentences are indistinguishable from sentences in the target
domain. The multi-modal critic assesses whether an image and its generated
sentence are a valid pair. During training, the critics and captioner act as
adversaries -- captioner aims to generate indistinguishable sentences, whereas
critics aim at distinguishing them. The assessment improves the captioner
through policy gradient updates. During inference, we further propose a novel
critic-based planning method to select high-quality sentences without
additional supervision (e.g., tags). To evaluate, we use MSCOCO as the source
domain and four other datasets (CUB-200-2011, Oxford-102, TGIF, and Flickr30k)
as the target domains. Our method consistently performs well on all datasets.
In particular, on CUB-200-2011, we achieve 21.8% CIDEr-D improvement after
adaptation. Utilizing critics during inference further gives another 4.5%
boost.

 <dc:description>  Training deep fully convolutional neural networks (F-CNNs) for semantic image
segmentation requires access to abundant labeled data. While large datasets of
unlabeled image data are available in medical applications, access to manually
labeled data is very limited. We propose to automatically create auxiliary
labels on initially unlabeled data with existing tools and to use them for
pre-training. For the subsequent fine-tuning of the network with manually
labeled data, we introduce error corrective boosting (ECB), which emphasizes
parameter updates on classes with lower accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce
SkipDeconv-Net (SD-Net), a new F-CNN architecture for brain segmentation that
combines skip connections with the unpooling strategy for upsampling. The
SD-Net addresses challenges of severe class imbalance and errors along
boundaries. With application to whole-brain MRI T1 scan segmentation, we
generate auxiliary labels on a large dataset with FreeSurfer and fine-tune on
two datasets with manual annotations. Our results show that the inclusion of
auxiliary labels and ECB yields significant improvements. SD-Net segments a 3D
scan in 7 secs in comparison to 30 hours for the closest multi-atlas
segmentation method, while reaching similar performance. It also outperforms
the latest state-of-the-art F-CNN models.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a deep cerebellar model articulation controller (DCMAC)
for adaptive noise cancellation (ANC). We expand upon the conventional CMAC by
stacking sin-gle-layer CMAC models into multiple layers to form a DCMAC model
and derive a modified backpropagation training algorithm to learn the DCMAC
parameters. Com-pared with conventional CMAC, the DCMAC can characterize
nonlinear transformations more effectively because of its deep structure.
Experimental results confirm that the pro-posed DCMAC model outperforms the
CMAC in terms of residual noise in an ANC task, showing that DCMAC provides
enhanced modeling capability based on channel characteristics.

on people's behavior and decisions boosted the interest to extract meaningful

propose a new reputation-based ranking system utilizing multipartite rating
subnetworks, that clusters users by their similarities, using Kolmogorov
complexity. Our system is novel in that it reflects a diversity of
opinions/preferences by assigning possibly distinct rankings, for the same
item, for different groups of users. We prove the convergence and efficiency of
the system and show that it copes better with spamming/spurious users, and it
is more robust to attacks than state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a scalable approach for robustly computing a 3D
surface mesh from multi-scale multi-view stereo point clouds that can handle
extreme jumps of point density (in our experiments three orders of magnitude).
The backbone of our approach is a combination of octree data partitioning,
local Delaunay tetrahedralization and graph cut optimization. Graph cut
optimization is used twice, once to extract surface hypotheses from local
Delaunay tetrahedralizations and once to merge overlapping surface hypotheses
even when the local tetrahedralizations do not share the same topology.This
formulation allows us to obtain a constant memory consumption per sub-problem
while at the same time retaining the density independent interpolation
properties of the Delaunay-based optimization. On multiple public datasets, we
demonstrate that our approach is highly competitive with the state-of-the-art
in terms of accuracy, completeness and outlier resilience. Further, we
demonstrate the multi-scale potential of our approach by processing a newly
recorded dataset with 2 billion points and a point density variation of more
than four orders of magnitude - requiring less than 9GB of RAM per process.

 <dc:title>Smart Assessment of and Tutoring for Computational Thinking MOOC
  Assignments using MindReader</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jamil, Hasan M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the major hurdles toward automatic semantic understanding of computer
programs is the lack of knowledge about what constitutes functional equivalence
of code segments. We postulate that a sound knowledgebase can be used to
deductively understand code segments in a hierarchical fashion by first
de-constructing a code and then reconstructing it from elementary knowledge and
equivalence rules of elementary code segments. The approach can also be
engineered to produce computable programs from conceptual and abstract
algorithms as an inverse function. In this paper, we introduce the core idea
behind the MindReader online assessment system that is able to understand a
wide variety of elementary algorithms students learn in their entry level
programming classes such as Java, C++ and Python. The MindReader system is able
to assess student assignments and guide them how to develop correct and better
code in real time without human assistance.

 <dc:description>  During the last decade, additive manufacturing has become increasingly
popular for rapid prototyping, but has remained relatively marginal beyond the
scope of prototyping when it comes to applications with tight tolerance
specifications, such as in aerospace. Despite a strong desire to supplant many
aerospace structures with printed builds, additive manufacturing has largely
remained limited to prototyping, tooling, fixtures, and non-critical
components. There are numerous fundamental challenges inherent to additive
processing to be addressed before this promise is realized. One ubiquitous
challenge across all AM motifs is to develop processing-property relationships
through precise, in situ monitoring coupled with formal methods and feedback
control. We suggest a significant component of this vision is a set of semantic
layers within 3D printing files relevant to the desired material
specifications. This semantic layer provides the feedback laws of the control
system, which then evaluates the component during processing and intelligently
evolves the build parameters within boundaries defined by semantic
specifications. This evaluation and correction loop requires on-the-fly
coupling of finite element analysis and topology optimization. The required
parameters for this analysis are all extracted from the semantic layer and can
be modified in situ to satisfy the global specifications. Therefore, the
representation of what is printed changes during the printing process to
compensate for eventual imprecision or drift arising during the manufacturing
process.

 <dc:title>Towards Practical, Precise and Parametric Energy Analysis of IT
  Controlled Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>van Gastel, Bernard</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Energy consumption analysis of IT-controlled systems can play a major role in
minimising the overall energy consumption of such IT systems, during the
development phase, or for optimisation in the field. Recently, a precise energy
analysis was developed, with the property of being parametric in the hardware.
In principle, this creates the opportunity to analyse which is the best
software implementation for given hardware, or the other way around: choose the
best hardware for a given algorithm.
  The precise analysis was introduced for a very limited language: ECA. In this
paper, several important steps are taken towards practical energy analysis. The
ECA language is extended with common programming language features. The
application domain is further explored, and threats to the validity are
identified and discussed. Altogether, this constitutes an important step
towards analysing energy consumption of IT-controlled systems in practice.

 <dc:title>The Problem of Coincidence in A Theory of Temporal Multiple Recurrence</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Akinkunmi, B. O.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Logical theories have been developed which have allowed temporal reasoning
about eventualities (a la Galton) such as states, processes, actions, events,
processes and complex eventualities such as sequences and recurrences of other
eventualities. This paper presents the problem of coincidence within the
framework of a first order logical theory formalising temporal multiple
recurrence of two sequences of fixed duration eventualities and presents a
solution to it The coincidence problem is described as: if two complex
eventualities (or eventuality sequences) consisting respectively of component
eventualities x0, x1,....,xr and y0, y1, ..,ys both recur over an interval k
and all eventualities are of fixed durations, is there a sub-interval of k over
which the incidence xt and yu for t between 0..r and s between 0..s coincide.
The solution presented here formalises the intuition that a solution can be
found by temporal projection over a cycle of the multiple recurrence of both
sequences.

 <dc:description>  In diffusion-based communication, as for molecular systems, the achievable
data rate is very low due to the slow nature of diffusion and the existence of
severe inter-symbol interference (ISI). Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
technique can be used to improve the data rate. Knowledge of channel impulse
response (CIR) is essential for equalization and detection in MIMO systems.
This paper presents a training-based CIR estimation for diffusive MIMO (D-MIMO)
channels. Maximum likelihood and least-squares estimators are derived, and the
training sequences are designed to minimize the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao
bound. Sub-optimal estimators are compared to Cram\'er-Rao bound to validate
their performance.

 <dc:description>  We present a sound and automated approach to synthesize safe digital feedback
controllers for physical plants represented as linear, time invariant models.
Models are given as dynamical equations with inputs, evolving over a continuous
state space and accounting for errors due to the digitalization of signals by
the controller. Our approach has two stages, leveraging counterexample guided
inductive synthesis (CEGIS) and reachability analysis. CEGIS synthesizes a
static feedback controller that stabilizes the system under restrictions given
by the safety of the reach space. Safety is verified either via BMC or abstract
acceleration; if the verification step fails, we refine the controller by
generalizing the counterexample. We synthesize stable and safe controllers for
intricate physical plant models from the digital control literature.

 <dc:title>Generalizing input-driven languages: theoretical and practical benefits</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Regular languages (RL) are the simplest family in Chomsky's hierarchy. Thanks
to their simplicity they enjoy various nice algebraic and logic properties that
have been successfully exploited in many application fields. Practically all of
their related problems are decidable, so that they support automatic
verification algorithms. Also, they can be recognized in real-time.
  Context-free languages (CFL) are another major family well-suited to
formalize programming, natural, and many other classes of languages; their
increased generative power w.r.t. RL, however, causes the loss of several
closure properties and of the decidability of important problems; furthermore
they need complex parsing algorithms. Thus, various subclasses thereof have
been defined with different goals, spanning from efficient, deterministic
parsing to closure properties, logic characterization and automatic
verification techniques.
  Among CFL subclasses, so-called structured ones, i.e., those where the
typical tree-structure is visible in the sentences, exhibit many of the
algebraic and logic properties of RL, whereas deterministic CFL have been
thoroughly exploited in compiler construction and other application fields.
  After surveying and comparing the main properties of those various language
families, we go back to operator precedence languages (OPL), an old family
through which R. Floyd pioneered deterministic parsing, and we show that they
offer unexpected properties in two fields so far investigated in totally
independent ways: they enable parsing parallelization in a more effective way
than traditional sequential parsers, and exhibit the same algebraic and logic
properties so far obtained only for less expressive language families.

 <dc:description>  We show variants of spectral sparsification routines can preserve the total
spanning tree counts of graphs, which by Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem, is
equivalent to determinant of a graph Laplacian minor, or equivalently, of any
SDDM matrix. Our analyses utilizes this combinatorial connection to bridge
between statistical leverage scores / effective resistances and the analysis of
random graphs by [Janson, Combinatorics, Probability and Computing `94]. This
leads to a routine that in quadratic time, sparsifies a graph down to about
$n^{1.5}$ edges in ways that preserve both the determinant and the distribution
of spanning trees (provided the sparsified graph is viewed as a random object).
Extending this algorithm to work with Schur complements and approximate
Choleksy factorizations leads to algorithms for counting and sampling spanning
trees which are nearly optimal for dense graphs.
  We give an algorithm that computes a $(1 \pm \delta)$ approximation to the
determinant of any SDDM matrix with constant probability in about $n^2
\delta^{-2}$ time. This is the first routine for graphs that outperforms
general-purpose routines for computing determinants of arbitrary matrices. We
also give an algorithm that generates in about $n^2 \delta^{-2}$ time a
spanning tree of a weighted undirected graph from a distribution with total
variation distance of $\delta$ from the $w$-uniform distribution .

 <dc:description>  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands have been attracting growing attention as a
possible candidate for next-generation cellular networks, since the available
spectrum is orders of magnitude larger than in current cellular allocations. To
precisely design mmWave systems, it is important to examine mmWave interference
and SIR coverage under large-scale deployments. For this purpose, we apply an
accurate mmWave channel model, derived from experiments, into an analytical
framework based on stochastic geometry. In this way we obtain a closed-form SIR
coverage probability in large-scale mmWave cellular networks.

 <dc:description>  The majority of medical documents and electronic health records (EHRs) are in
text format that poses a challenge for data processing and finding relevant
documents. Looking for ways to automatically retrieve the enormous amount of
health and medical knowledge has always been an intriguing topic. Powerful
methods have been developed in recent years to make the text processing
automatic. One of the popular approaches to retrieve information based on
discovering the themes in health &amp; medical corpora is topic modeling, however,
this approach still needs new perspectives. In this research we describe fuzzy
latent semantic analysis (FLSA), a novel approach in topic modeling using fuzzy
perspective. FLSA can handle health &amp; medical corpora redundancy issue and
provides a new method to estimate the number of topics. The quantitative
evaluations show that FLSA produces superior performance and features to latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA), the most popular topic model.

 <dc:description>  We consider space efficient hash tables that can grow and shrink dynamically
and are always highly space efficient, i.e., their space consumption is always
close to the lower bound even while growing and when taking into account
storage that is only needed temporarily. None of the traditionally used hash
tables have this property. We show how known approaches like linear probing and
bucket cuckoo hashing can be adapted to this scenario by subdividing them into
many subtables or using virtual memory overcommitting. However, these rather
straightforward solutions suffer from slow amortized insertion times due to
frequent reallocation in small increments.
  Our main result is DySECT ({\bf Dy}namic {\bf S}pace {\bf E}fficient {\bf
C}uckoo {\bf T}able) which avoids these problems. DySECT consists of many
subtables which grow by doubling their size. The resulting inhomogeneity in
subtable sizes is equalized by the flexibility available in bucket cuckoo
hashing where each element can go to several buckets each of which containing
several cells. Experiments indicate that DySECT works well with load factors up
to 98\%. With up to 2.7 times better performance than the next best solution.

 <dc:description>  Location-aided beam alignment has been proposed recently as a potential
approach for fast link establishment in millimeter wave (mmWave) massive MIMO
(mMIMO) communications. However, due to mobility and other imperfections in the
estimation process, the spatial information obtained at the base station (BS)
and the user (UE) is likely to be noisy, degrading beam alignment performance.
In this paper, we introduce a robust beam alignment framework in order to
exhibit resilience with respect to this problem. We first recast beam alignment
as a decentralized coordination problem where BS and UE seek coordination on
the basis of correlated yet individual position information. We formulate the
optimum beam alignment solution as the solution of a Bayesian team decision
problem. We then propose a suite of algorithms to approach optimality with
reduced complexity. The effectiveness of the robust beam alignment procedure,
compared with classical designs, is then verified on simulation settings with
varying location information accuracies.

 <dc:description>  We seek to automate the data capturing process in image-based modeling, which
is often tedious and time consuming now. At the heart of our system is an
iterative linear method to solve the multi-view stereo (MVS) problem quickly.
Unlike conventional MVS algorithms that solve a per-pixel depth at each input
image, we represent the depth map at each image as a piecewise planar triangle
mesh and solve it by an iterative linear method. The edges of the triangle mesh
are snapped to image edges to better capture scene structures. Our fast MVS
algorithm enables online model reconstruction and quality assessment to
determine the next-best-views (NBVs) for modeling. The NBVs are searched in a
plane above unreconstructed shapes. In this way, our path planning can use the
result from 3D reconstruction to guarantee obstacle avoidance. We test this
system with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a simulator, an indoor motion
capture system (Vicon) room, and outdoor open spaces.

 <dc:description>  Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is wildly applied in multi-sensor data
fusion. However, lots of uncertainty and interference exist in practical
situation, especially in the battle field. It is still an open issue to model
the reliability of sensor reports. Many methods are proposed based on the
relationship among collected data. In this letter, we proposed a quantum
mechanical approach to evaluate the reliability of sensor reports, which is
based on the properties of a sensor itself. The proposed method is used to
modify the combining of evidences.

 <dc:description>  Motivation: Tumor classification using Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS) data
has a high potential for future applications in pathology. Due to the
complexity and size of the data, automated feature extraction and
classification steps are required to fully process the data. Deep learning
offers an approach to learn feature extraction and classification combined in a
single model. Commonly these steps are handled separately in IMS data analysis,
hence deep learning offers an alternative strategy worthwhile to explore.
Results: Methodologically, we propose an adapted architecture based on deep
convolutional networks to handle the characteristics of mass spectrometry data,
as well as a strategy to interpret the learned model in the spectral domain
based on a sensitivity analysis. The proposed methods are evaluated on two
challenging tumor classification tasks and compared to a baseline approach.
Competitiveness of the proposed methods are shown on both tasks by studying the
performance via cross-validation. Moreover, the learned models are analyzed by
the proposed sensitivity analysis revealing biologically plausible effects as
well as confounding factors of the considered task. Thus, this study may serve
as a starting point for further development of deep learning approaches in IMS
classification tasks.

 <dc:description>  Even though a linguistics-free sequence to sequence model in neural machine
translation (NMT) has certain capability of implicitly learning syntactic
information of source sentences, this paper shows that source syntax can be
explicitly incorporated into NMT effectively to provide further improvements.
Specifically, we linearize parse trees of source sentences to obtain structural
label sequences. On the basis, we propose three different sorts of encoders to
incorporate source syntax into NMT: 1) Parallel RNN encoder that learns word
and label annotation vectors parallelly; 2) Hierarchical RNN encoder that
learns word and label annotation vectors in a two-level hierarchy; and 3) Mixed
RNN encoder that stitchingly learns word and label annotation vectors over
sequences where words and labels are mixed. Experimentation on
Chinese-to-English translation demonstrates that all the three proposed
syntactic encoders are able to improve translation accuracy. It is interesting
to note that the simplest RNN encoder, i.e., Mixed RNN encoder yields the best
performance with an significant improvement of 1.4 BLEU points. Moreover, an
in-depth analysis from several perspectives is provided to reveal how source
syntax benefits NMT.

 <dc:description>  The small-signal impedance modeling of modular multilevel converter (MMC) is
the key for analyzing resonance and stability of MMC-based ac power electronics
systems. MMC is a converter system with a typical multi-frequency response due
to its significant steady-state harmonic components in the arm currents,
capacitor voltages, and control signals. Therefore, traditional small-signal
modeling methods for 2-level voltage-source converters (VSCs) cannot be
directly applied to the MMC. In this paper, the harmonic state-space (HSS)
modeling approach is introduced to characterize the harmonic coupling behavior
of the MMC. On this basis, the small-signal impedance models of the MMC are
developed according to the harmonic linearization principle, which can include
all the steady-state harmonic effects of the state variables, leading to the
accurate impedance models. Furthermore, in order to reveal the impact of the
internal dynamics and closed-loop control on the small-signal impedance of the
MMC, three cases are considered in this paper, i.e., open-loop control, ac
voltage closed-loop control, and circulating current closed-loop control.
Finally, the analytical impedance models are verified by both simulation and
experimental results.

 <dc:description>  The deployment of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in safety-critical
applications poses a number of new verification and certification challenges.
In particular, for ANN-enabled self-driving vehicles it is important to
establish properties about the resilience of ANNs to noisy or even maliciously
manipulated sensory input. We are addressing these challenges by defining
resilience properties of ANN-based classifiers as the maximal amount of input
or sensor perturbation which is still tolerated. This problem of computing
maximal perturbation bounds for ANNs is then reduced to solving mixed integer
optimization problems (MIP). A number of MIP encoding heuristics are developed
for drastically reducing MIP-solver runtimes, and using parallelization of
MIP-solvers results in an almost linear speed-up in the number (up to a certain
limit) of computing cores in our experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness
and scalability of our approach by means of computing maximal resilience bounds
for a number of ANN benchmark sets ranging from typical image recognition
scenarios to the autonomous maneuvering of robots.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of transmitting classical information over a
time-invariant channel with memory. A popular class of time-invariant channels
with memory are finite-state-machine channels, where a \emph{classical} state
evolves over time and governs the relationship between the classical input and
the classical output of the channel. For such channels, various techniques have
been developed for estimating and bounding the information rate. In this paper
we consider a class of time-invariant channels where a \emph{quantum} state
evolves over time and governs the relationship between the classical input and
the classical output of the channel. We propose algorithms for estimating and
bounding the information rate of such channels. In particular, we discuss
suitable graphical models for doing the relevant computations.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new model that uses named entity recognition,
coreference resolution, and entity linking techniques, to approach the task of
linking people entities on Wikipedia people pages to their corresponding
Wikipedia pages if applicable. Our task is different from general and
traditional entity linking because we are working in a limited domain, namely,
people entities, and we are including pronouns as entities, whereas in the
past, pronouns were never considered as entities in entity linking. We have
built 2 models, both outperforms our baseline model significantly. The purpose
of our project is to build a model that could be use to generate cleaner data
for future entity linking tasks. Our contribution include a clean data set
consisting of 50Wikipedia people pages, and 2 entity linking models,
specifically tuned for this domain.

 <dc:description>  Operating networks depends on collecting and analyzing measurement data.
Current technologies do not make it easy to do so, typically because they
separate data collection (e.g., packet capture or flow monitoring) from
analysis, producing either too much data to answer a general question or too
little data to answer a detailed question. In this paper, we present Sonata, a
network telemetry system that uses a uniform query interface to drive the joint
collection and analysis of network traffic. Sonata takes the advantage of two
emerging technologies---streaming analytics platforms and programmable network
devices---to facilitate joint collection and analysis. Sonata allows operators
to more directly express network traffic analysis tasks in terms of a
high-level language. The underlying runtime partitions each query into a
portion that runs on the switch and another that runs on the streaming
analytics platform iteratively refines the query to efficiently capture only
the traffic that pertains to the operator's query, and exploits sketches to
reduce state in switches in exchange for more approximate results. Through an
evaluation of a prototype implementation, we demonstrate that Sonata can
support a wide range of network telemetry tasks with less state in the network,
and lower data rates to streaming analytics systems, than current approaches
can achieve.

 <dc:description>  Pilot reuse in multi-cell massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system is
investigated where user groups with different priorities exist. Recent
investigation on pilot reuse has revealed that when the ratio of the coherent
time interval to the number of users is reasonably high, it is beneficial not
to fully reuse pilots from interfering cells. This work finds the optimum pilot
assignment strategy that would maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) given the
user groups with different priorities. A closed-form solution for the optimal
pilot assignment is derived and is shown to make intuitive sense. Performance
comparison shows that under wide range of channel conditions, the optimal pilot
assignment that uses extra set of pilots achieves better WSR performance than
conventional full pilot reuse.

 <dc:description>  Asymptotic properties of Markov Processes, such as steady state probabilities
or hazard rate for absorbing states can be efficiently calculated by means of
linear algebra even for large-scale problems. This paper discusses the methods
for adjusting parameters of the Markov models to account for non-constant
transition rates. In particular, transitions with fixed delays are considered
along with the transitions that follow Weibull and lognormal distributions.
Procedures for both steady-state solutions in the absence of an absorbing

 <dc:title>An improved Ant Colony System for the Sequential Ordering Problem</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is not rare that the performance of one metaheuristic algorithm can be
improved by incorporating ideas taken from another. In this article we present
how Simulated Annealing (SA) can be used to improve the efficiency of the Ant
Colony System (ACS) and Enhanced ACS when solving the Sequential Ordering
Problem (SOP). Moreover, we show how the very same ideas can be applied to
improve the convergence of a dedicated local search, i.e. the SOP-3-exchange
algorithm. A statistical analysis of the proposed algorithms both in terms of
finding suitable parameter values and the quality of the generated solutions is
presented based on a series of computational experiments conducted on SOP
instances from the well-known TSPLIB and SOPLIB2006 repositories. The proposed
ACS-SA and EACS-SA algorithms often generate solutions of better quality than
the ACS and EACS, respectively. Moreover, the EACS-SA algorithm combined with
the proposed SOP-3-exchange-SA local search was able to find 10 new best
solutions for the SOP instances from the SOPLIB2006 repository, thus improving
the state-of-the-art results as known from the literature. Overall, the best
known or improved solutions were found in 41 out of 48 cases.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes a new evolutionary algorithm that is especially well
suited to AI-Assisted Game Design. The approach adopted in this paper is to use
observations of AI agents playing the game to estimate the game's quality. Some
of best agents for this purpose are General Video Game AI agents, since they
can be deployed directly on a new game without game-specific tuning; these
agents tend to be based on stochastic algorithms which give robust but noisy
results and tend to be expensive to run. This motivates the main contribution
of the paper: the development of the novel N-Tuple Bandit Evolutionary
Algorithm, where a model is used to estimate the fitness of unsampled points
and a bandit approach is used to balance exploration and exploitation of the
search space. Initial results on optimising a Space Battle game variant suggest
that the algorithm offers far more robust results than the Random Mutation Hill
Climber and a Biased Mutation variant, which are themselves known to offer
competitive performance across a range of problems. Subjective observations are
also given by human players on the nature of the evolved games, which indicate
a preference towards games generated by the N-Tuple algorithm.

 <dc:title>The Power of Shared Randomness in Uncertain Communication</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ghazi, Badih</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sudan, Madhu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In a recent work (Ghazi et al., SODA 2016), the authors with Komargodski and
Kothari initiated the study of communication with contextual uncertainty, a
setup aiming to understand how efficient communication is possible when the
communicating parties imperfectly share a huge context. In this setting, Alice
is given a function $f$ and an input string $x$, and Bob is given a function
$g$ and an input string $y$. The pair $(x,y)$ comes from a known distribution
$\mu$ and $f$ and $g$ are guaranteed to be close under this distribution. Alice
and Bob wish to compute $g(x,y)$ with high probability. The previous work
showed that any problem with one-way communication complexity $k$ in the
standard model has public-coin communication $O(k(1+I))$ bits in the uncertain
case, where $I$ is the mutual information between $x$ and $y$. A lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{I})$ bits on the public-coin uncertain communication was also
shown. An important question that was left open is the power that public
randomness brings to uncertain communication. Can Alice and Bob achieve
efficient communication amid uncertainty without using public randomness? How
powerful are public-coin protocols in overcoming uncertainty? Motivated by
these two questions:
  - We prove the first separation between private-coin uncertain communication
and public-coin uncertain communication. We exhibit a function class for which
the communication in the standard model and the public-coin uncertain
communication are $O(1)$ while the private-coin uncertain communication is a
growing function of the length $n$ of the inputs.
  - We improve the lower-bound of the previous work on public-coin uncertain
communication. We exhibit a function class and a distribution (with $I \approx
n$) for which the one-way certain communication is $k$ bits but the one-way
public-coin uncertain communication is at least $\Omega(\sqrt{k} \cdot
\sqrt{I})$ bits.

 <dc:title>When the Hammer Meets the Nail: Multi-Server PIR for Database-Driven CRN
  with Location Privacy Assurance</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show that it is possible to achieve information theoretic location privacy
for secondary users (SUs) in database-driven cognitive radio networks (CRNs)
with an end-to-end delay less than a second, which is significantly better than
that of the existing alternatives offering only a computational privacy. This
is achieved based on a keen observation that, by the requirement of Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), all certified spectrum databases synchronize
their records. Hence, the same copy of spectrum database is available through
multiple (distinct) providers. We harness the synergy between multi-server
private information retrieval (PIR) and database- driven CRN architecture to
offer an optimal level of privacy with high efficiency by exploiting this
observation. We demonstrated, analytically and experimentally with deployments
on actual cloud systems that, our adaptations of multi-server PIR outperform
that of the (currently) fastest single-server PIR by a magnitude of times with
information theoretic security, collusion resiliency, and fault-tolerance
features. Our analysis indicates that multi-server PIR is an ideal
cryptographic tool to provide location privacy in database-driven CRNs, in
which the requirement of replicated databases is a natural part of the system
architecture, and therefore SUs can enjoy all advantages of multi-server PIR
without any additional architectural and deployment costs.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new technique for visual attribute transfer across images that
may have very different appearance but have perceptually similar semantic
structure. By visual attribute transfer, we mean transfer of visual information
(such as color, tone, texture, and style) from one image to another. For
example, one image could be that of a painting or a sketch while the other is a
photo of a real scene, and both depict the same type of scene.
  Our technique finds semantically-meaningful dense correspondences between two
input images. To accomplish this, it adapts the notion of &quot;image analogy&quot; with
features extracted from a Deep Convolutional Neutral Network for matching; we
call our technique Deep Image Analogy. A coarse-to-fine strategy is used to
compute the nearest-neighbor field for generating the results. We validate the
effectiveness of our proposed method in a variety of cases, including
style/texture transfer, color/style swap, sketch/painting to photo, and time
lapse.

 <dc:description>  A `peer-review system' in the context of judging research contributions, is
one of the prime steps undertaken to ensure the quality of the submissions
received, a significant portion of the publishing budget is spent towards
successful completion of the peer-review by the publication houses.
Nevertheless, the scientific community is largely reaching a consensus that
peer-review system, although indispensable, is nonetheless flawed. A very
pertinent question therefore is &quot;could this system be improved?&quot;. In this
paper, we attempt to present an answer to this question by considering a
massive dataset of around $29k$ papers with roughly $70k$ distinct review
reports together consisting of $12m$ lines of review text from the Journal of
High Energy Physics (JHEP) between 1997 and 2015. In specific, we introduce a
novel \textit{reviewer-reviewer interaction network} (an edge exists between
two reviewers if they were assigned by the same editor) and show that
surprisingly the simple structural properties of this network such as degree,
clustering coefficient, centrality (closeness, betweenness etc.) serve as
strong predictors of the long-term citations (i.e., the overall scientific
impact) of a submitted paper. These features, when plugged in a regression
model, alone achieves a high $R^2$ of \0.79 and a low $RMSE$ of 0.496 in
predicting the long-term citations. In addition, we also design a set of
supporting features built from the basic characteristics of the submitted
papers, the authors and the referees (e.g., the popularity of the submitting
author, the acceptance rate history of a referee, the linguistic properties
laden in the text of the review reports etc.), which further results in overall
improvement with $R^2$ of 0.81 and $RMSE$ of 0.46.

 <dc:description>  We consider a sequence of repeated prediction games and formally pass to the
limit. The supersolutions of the resulting non-linear parabolic partial
differential equation are closely related to the potential functions in the
sense of N.\,Cesa-Bianci, G.\,Lugosi (2003). Any such supersolution gives an
upper bound for forecaster's regret and suggests a potential-based prediction
strategy, satisfying the Blackwell condition. A conventional upper bound for
the worst-case regret is justified by a simple verification argument.

 <dc:title>Towards Predictions of the Image Quality of Experience for Augmented

 <dc:creator>Bauman, Brian</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Augmented Reality (AR) devices are commonly head-worn to overlay
context-dependent information into the field of view of the device operators.
One particular scenario is the overlay of still images, either in a traditional
fashion, or as spherical, i.e., immersive, content. For both media types, we
evaluate the interplay of user ratings as Quality of Experience (QoE) with (i)
the non-referential BRISQUE objective image quality metric and (ii) human
subject dry electrode EEG signals gathered with a commercial device.
Additionally, we employ basic machine learning approaches to assess the
possibility of QoE predictions based on rudimentary subject data. Corroborating
prior research for the overall scenario, we find strong correlations for both
approaches with user ratings as Mean Opinion Scores, which we consider as QoE
metric. In prediction scenarios based on data subsets, we find good performance
for the objective metric as well as the EEG-based approach. While the objective
metric can yield high QoE prediction accuracies overall, it is limited i its
application for individual subjects. The subject-based EEG approach, on the
other hand, enables good predictability of the QoE for both media types, but
with better performance for regular content. Our results can be employed in
practical scenarios by content and network service providers to optimize the
user experience in augmented reality scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Bond prices are a reflection of extremely complex market interactions and
policies, making prediction of future prices difficult. This task becomes even
more challenging due to the dearth of relevant information, and accuracy is not
the only consideration--in trading situations, time is of the essence. Thus,
machine learning in the context of bond price predictions should be both fast
and accurate. In this course project, we use a dataset describing the previous
10 trades of a large number of bonds among other relevant descriptive metrics
to predict future bond prices. Each of 762,678 bonds in the dataset is
described by a total of 61 attributes, including a ground truth trade price. We
evaluate the performance of various supervised learning algorithms for
regression followed by ensemble methods, with feature and model selection
considerations being treated in detail. We further evaluate all methods on both
accuracy and speed. Finally, we propose a novel hybrid time-series aided
machine learning method that could be applied to such datasets in future work.

 <dc:description>  This work studies the entity-wise topical behavior from massive network logs.
Both the temporal and the spatial relationships of the behavior are explored
with the learning architectures combing the recurrent neural network (RNN) and
the convolutional neural network (CNN). To make the behavioral data appropriate
for the spatial learning in CNN, several reduction steps are taken to form the
topical metrics and place them homogeneously like pixels in the images. The
experimental result shows both the temporal- and the spatial- gains when
compared to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. A new learning framework
called spatially connected convolutional networks (SCCN) is introduced to more
efficiently predict the behavior.

 <dc:description>  We consider the model of population protocols, which can be viewed as a
sequence of random pairwise interactions of $n$ agents (nodes). We show
population protocols for two problems: the leader election and the exact
majority voting. The leader election starts with all agents in the same initial
state and the goal is to converge to the (global) state when exactly one agent
is in a distinct state $L$. The exact majority voting starts with each agent in
one of the two distinct states $A$ or $B$ and the goal is to make all nodes
know which of these two states was the initial majority state, even if that
majority was just by a single vote.
  Alistarh and Gelashvili [ICALP 2015] showed a leader-election protocol which
converges in $O(\log^3 n)$ time w.h.p. and in expectation and needs
$\Theta(\log^3 n)$ states per agent. We present a protocol which elects the
leader in $O(\log^2 n)$ time w.h.p. and in expectation and uses $\Theta(\log^2
n)$ states per agent. For the exact majority voting, we show a population
protocol with the same asymptotic performance: $O(\log^2 n)$ time and
$\Theta(\log^2 n)$ states per agent. The exact-majority protocol proposed by
Alistarh et al. [PODC 2015] achieves expected $O(\log^2 n)$ time, but requires
a relatively high initial imbalance between $A$'s and $B$'s or a large number
of states per agent. More recently, Alistarh et al. [SODA 2017] showed
$O(\log^2 n)$-state protocols for both problems, with the exact majority
protocol converging in time $O(\log^3 n)$, and the leader election protocol
converging in time $O(\log^{6.3} n)$ w.h.p. and $O(\log^{5.3} n)$ in
expectation.
  Our leader election and exact majority protocols are based on the idea of
agents counting their local interactions and rely on the probabilistic fact
that the uniform random selection would limit the divergence of the individual
counts.

 <dc:description>  Science policy is increasingly shifting towards an emphasis in societal
problems or grand challenges. As a result, new evaluative tools are needed to
help assess not only the knowledge production side of research programmes or
organisations, but also the articulation of research agendas with societal
needs. In this paper, we present an exploratory investigation of science supply
and societal needs on the grand challenge of obesity -an emerging health
problem with enormous social costs. We illustrate a potential approach that
uses topic modelling to explore: (a) how scientific publications can be used to
describe existing priorities in science production; (b) how records of
questions posed in the European parliament can be used as an instance of
mapping discourse of social needs; (c) how the comparison between the two may
show (mis)alignments between societal concerns and scientific outputs. While
this is a technical exercise, we propose that this type of mapping methods can
be useful for informing strategic planning and evaluation in funding agencies.

 <dc:description>  In this project, we propose a novel approach for estimating depth from RGB
images. Traditionally, most work uses a single RGB image to estimate depth,
which is inherently difficult and generally results in poor performance, even
with thousands of data examples. In this work, we alternatively use multiple
RGB images that were captured while changing the focus of the camera's lens.
This method leverages the natural depth information correlated to the different
patterns of clarity/blur in the sequence of focal images, which helps
distinguish objects at different depths. Since no such data set exists for
learning this mapping, we collect our own data set using customized hardware.
We then use a convolutional neural network for learning the depth from the
stacked focal images. Comparative studies were conducted on both a standard
RGBD data set and our own data set (learning from both single and multiple
images), and results verified that stacked focal images yield better depth
estimation than using just single RGB image.

 <dc:description>  Understanding shading effects in images is critical for a variety of vision
and graphics problems, including intrinsic image decomposition, shadow removal,
image relighting, and inverse rendering. As is the case with other vision
tasks, machine learning is a promising approach to understanding shading - but
there is little ground truth shading data available for real-world images. We
introduce Shading Annotations in the Wild (SAW), a new large-scale, public
dataset of shading annotations in indoor scenes, comprised of multiple forms of
shading judgments obtained via crowdsourcing, along with shading annotations
automatically generated from RGB-D imagery. We use this data to train a
convolutional neural network to predict per-pixel shading information in an
image. We demonstrate the value of our data and network in an application to
intrinsic images, where we can reduce decomposition artifacts produced by
existing algorithms. Our database is available at
http://opensurfaces.cs.cornell.edu/saw/.

 <dc:title>Revisiting Parametricity: Inductives and Uniformity of Propositions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Anand, Abhishek</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Morrisett, Greg</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Reynold's parametricity theory captures the property that parametrically
polymorphic functions behave uniformly: they produce related results on related
instantiations. In dependently-typed programming languages, such relations and
uniformity proofs can be expressed internally, and generated as a program
translation.
  We present a new parametricity translation for a significant fragment of Coq.
Previous translations of parametrically polymorphic propositions allowed
non-uniformity. For example, on related instantiations, a function may return
propositions that are logically inequivalent (e.g. True and False). We show
that uniformity of polymorphic propositions is not achievable in general.
Nevertheless, our translation produces proofs that the two propositions are
logically equivalent and also that any two proofs of those propositions are
related. This is achieved at the cost of potentially requiring more assumptions
on the instantiations, requiring them to be isomorphic in the worst case.
  Our translation augments the previous one for Coq by carrying and
compositionally building extra proofs about parametricity relations. It is made
easier by a new method for translating inductive types and pattern matching.
The new method builds upon and generalizes previous such translations for
dependently-typed programming languages.
  Using reification and reflection, we have implemented our translation as Coq
programs. We obtain several stronger free theorems applicable to an ongoing
compiler-correctness project. Previously, proofs of some of these theorems took
several hours to finish.

 <dc:description>  We use the language of uninformative Bayesian prior choice to study the
selection of appropriately simple effective models. We advocate for the prior
which maximizes the mutual information between parameters and predictions,
learning as much as possible from limited data. When many parameters are poorly
constrained by the available data, we find that this prior puts weight only on
boundaries of the parameter manifold. Thus it selects a lower-dimensional
effective theory in a principled way, ignoring irrelevant parameter directions.
In the limit where there is sufficient data to tightly constrain any number of
parameters, this reduces to Jeffreys prior. But we argue that this limit is
pathological, as it leads to dramatic dependence on effects invisible to
experiment.

 <dc:description>  Localization is an essential component for autonomous robots. A
well-established localization approach combines ray casting with a particle
filter, leading to a computationally expensive algorithm that is difficult to
run on resource-constrained mobile robots. We present a novel data structure
called the Compressed Directional Distance Transform for accelerating ray
casting in two dimensional occupancy grid maps. Our approach has near constant
time ray casting performance for a fixed size map, in contrast with other
methods which display long tail query time distributions. Our experimental
results show that the proposed algorithm approximates the performance
characteristics of reading from a three dimensional lookup table of ray cast
solutions while requiring two orders of magnitude less memory and
precomputation. This results in a particle filter algorithm which can maintain
2500 particles with 61 ray casts per particle at 40Hz, using only a single CPU
thread onboard a mobile robot.

 <dc:title>Imagining Probabilistic Belief Change as Imaging (Technical Report)</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rens, Gavin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Meyer, Thomas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Imaging is a form of probabilistic belief change which could be employed for
both revision and update. In this paper, we propose a new framework for
probabilistic belief change based on imaging, called Expected Distance Imaging
(EDI). EDI is sufficiently general to define Bayesian conditioning and other
forms of imaging previously defined in the literature. We argue that, and
investigate how, EDI can be used for both revision and update. EDI's definition
depends crucially on a weight function whose properties are studied and whose
effect on belief change operations is analysed. Finally, four EDI
instantiations are proposed, two for revision and two for update, and
probabilistic rationality postulates are suggested for their analysis.

 <dc:description>  Context: Virtual machines provide isolation of services at the cost of
hypervisors and more resource usage. This spurred the growth of systems like
Docker that enable single hosts to isolate several applications, similar to
VMs, within a low-overhead abstraction called containers.
  Motivation: Although containers tout low overhead performance, do they still
have low energy consumption?
  Methodology: This work statistically compares ($t$-test, Wilcoxon) the energy
consumption of three application workloads in Docker and on bare-metal Linux.
  Results: In all cases, there was a statistically significant ($t$-test and
Wilcoxon $p &lt; 0.05$) increase in energy consumption when running tests in
Docker, mostly due to the performance of I/O system calls.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Temporal action detection in long videos is an important problem.
State-of-the-art methods address this problem by applying action classifiers on
sliding windows. Although sliding windows may contain an identifiable portion
of the actions, they may not necessarily cover the entire action instance,
which would lead to inferior performance. We adapt a two-stage temporal action
detection pipeline with Cascaded Boundary Regression (CBR) model.
Class-agnostic proposals and specific actions are detected respectively in the
first and the second stage. CBR uses temporal coordinate regression to refine
the temporal boundaries of the sliding windows. The salient aspect of the
refinement process is that, inside each stage, the temporal boundaries are
adjusted in a cascaded way by feeding the refined windows back to the system
for further boundary refinement. We test CBR on THUMOS-14 and TVSeries, and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. The performance gain is
especially remarkable under high IoU thresholds, e.g. map@tIoU=0.5 on THUMOS-14
is improved from 19.0% to 31.0%.

 <dc:description>  Each year, millions of motor vehicle traffic accidents all over the world
cause a large number of fatalities, injuries and significant material loss.
Automated Driving (AD) has potential to drastically reduce such accidents. In
this work, we focus on the technical challenges that arise from AD in urban
environments. We present the overall architecture of an AD system and describe
in detail the perception and planning modules. The AD system, built on a
modified Acura RLX, was demonstrated in a course in GoMentum Station in
California. We demonstrated autonomous handling of 4 scenarios: traffic lights,
cross-traffic at intersections, construction zones and pedestrians. The AD
vehicle displayed safe behavior and performed consistently in repeated
demonstrations with slight variations in conditions. Overall, we completed 44
runs, encompassing 110km of automated driving with only 3 cases where the
driver intervened the control of the vehicle, mostly due to error in GPS
positioning. Our demonstration showed that robust and consistent behavior in
urban scenarios is possible, yet more investigation is necessary for full scale
roll-out on public roads.

 <dc:title>Resource Allocation for Elastic Optical Networks using Geometric
  Optimization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hadi, Mohammad</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Pakravan, Mohammad Reza</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Resource allocation with quality of service constraints is one of the most
challenging problems in elastic optical networks which is normally formulated
as an MINLP optimization program. In this paper, we focus on novel properties
of geometric optimization and provide a heuristic approach for resource
allocation which is very faster than its MINLP counterpart. Our heuristic
consists of two main parts for routing/traffic ordering and power/spectrum
assignment. It aims at minimization of transmitted optical power and spectrum
usage constrained to quality of service and physical requirements. We consider
three routing/traffic ordering procedures and compare them in terms of total
transmitted optical power, total received noise power and total nonlinear
interference including self- and cross-channel interferences. We propose a
posynomial expression for optical signal to noise ratio in which fiber
nonlinearities and spontaneous emission noise have been addressed. We also
propose posynomial expressions that relate modulation spectral efficiency to
its corresponding minimum required optical signal to noise ratio. We then use
the posynomial expressions to develop six geometric formulations for
power/spectrum assignment part of the heuristic which are different in run
time, complexity and accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
solution has a very good accuracy and much lower computational complexity in
comparison with MINLP formulation. As example for European Cost239 optical
network with 46 transmit transponders, the geometric formulations can be more
than 59 times faster than its MINLP counterpart. Numerical results also reveal
that in long-haul elastic optical networks, considering the product of the
number of common fiber spans and the transmission bit rate is a better goal
function for routing/traffic ordering sub-problem.

 <dc:description>  We derive upper and lower bounds on the degree $d$ for which the Lov\'asz
$\vartheta$ function, or equivalently sum-of-squares proofs with degree two,
can refute the existence of a $k$-coloring in random regular graphs $G_{n,d}$.
We show that this type of refutation fails well above the $k$-colorability
transition, and in particular everywhere below the Kesten-Stigum threshold.
This is consistent with the conjecture that refuting $k$-colorability, or
distinguishing $G_{n,d}$ from the planted coloring model, is hard in this
region. Our results also apply to the disassortative case of the stochastic
block model, adding evidence to the conjecture that there is a regime where
community detection is computationally hard even though it is
information-theoretically possible. Using orthogonal polynomials, we also
provide explicit upper bounds on $\vartheta(\overline{G})$ for regular graphs
of a given girth, which may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Providing an efficient strategy to navigate safely through unsignaled
intersections is a difficult task that requires determining the intent of other
drivers. We explore the effectiveness of using Deep Reinforcement Learning to
handle intersection problems. Combining several recent advances in Deep RL,
were we able to learn policies that surpass the performance of a commonly-used
heuristic approach in several metrics including task completion time and goal
success rate. Our analysis, and the solutions learned by the network point out
several short comings of current rule-based methods. The fact that Deep RL
policies resulted in collisions, although rarely, combined with the limitations
of the policy to generalize well to out-of-sample scenarios suggest a need for
further research.

 <dc:description>  We analyze how the knowledge to autonomously handle one type of intersection,
represented as a Deep Q-Network, translates to other types of intersections
(tasks). We view intersection handling as a deep reinforcement learning
problem, which approximates the state action Q function as a deep neural
network. Using a traffic simulator, we show that directly copying a network
trained for one type of intersection to another type of intersection decreases
the success rate. We also show that when a network that is pre-trained on Task
A and then is fine-tuned on a Task B, the resulting network not only performs
better on the Task B than an network exclusively trained on Task A, but also
retained knowledge on the Task A. Finally, we examine a lifelong learning
setting, where we train a single network on five different types of
intersections sequentially and show that the resulting network exhibited
catastrophic forgetting of knowledge on previous tasks. This result suggests a
need for a long-term memory component to preserve knowledge.

 <dc:description>  When programmers look for how to achieve certain programming tasks, Stack
Overflow is a popular destination in search engine results. Over the years,
Stack Overflow has accumulated an impressive knowledge base of snippets of code
that are amply documented. We are interested in studying how programmers use
these snippets of code in their projects. Can we find Stack Overflow snippets
in real projects? When snippets are used, is this copy literal or does it
suffer adaptations? And are these adaptations specializations required by the
idiosyncrasies of the target artifact, or are they motivated by specific
requirements of the programmer? The large-scale study presented on this paper
analyzes 909k non-fork Python projects hosted on Github, which contain 290M
function definitions, and 1.9M Python snippets captured in Stack Overflow.
Results are presented as quantitative analysis of block-level code cloning
intra and inter Stack Overflow and GitHub, and as an analysis of programming
behaviors through the qualitative analysis of our findings.

 <dc:description>  Dimensionality reduction is a crucial step for pattern recognition and data
mining tasks to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Principal component
analysis (PCA) is a traditional technique for unsupervised dimensionality
reduction, which is often employed to seek a projection to best represent the
data in a least-squares sense, but if the original data is nonlinear structure,
the performance of PCA will quickly drop. An supervised dimensionality
reduction algorithm called Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) seeks for an
embedding transformation, which can work well with Gaussian distribution data
or single-modal data, but for non-Gaussian distribution data or multimodal
data, it gives undesired results. What is worse, the dimension of LDA cannot be
more than the number of classes. In order to solve these issues, Local shrunk
discriminant analysis (LSDA) is proposed in this work to process the
non-Gaussian distribution data or multimodal data, which not only incorporate
both the linear and nonlinear structures of original data, but also learn the
pattern shrinking to make the data more flexible to fit the manifold structure.
Further, LSDA has more strong generalization performance, whose objective
function will become local LDA and traditional LDA when different extreme
parameters are utilized respectively. What is more, a new efficient
optimization algorithm is introduced to solve the non-convex objective function
with low computational cost. Compared with other related approaches, such as
PCA, LDA and local LDA, the proposed method can derive a subspace which is more
suitable for non-Gaussian distribution and real data. Promising experimental
results on different kinds of data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  With the introduction of caching capabilities into small cell networks
(SCNs), new backaul management mechanisms need to be developed to prevent the
predicted files that are downloaded by the at the small base stations (SBSs) to
be cached from jeopardizing the urgent requests that need to be served via the
backhaul. Moreover, these mechanisms must account for the heterogeneity of the
backhaul that will be encompassing both wireless backhaul links at various
frequency bands and a wired backhaul component. In this paper, the
heterogeneous backhaul management problem is formulated as a minority game in
which each SBS has to define the number of predicted files to download, without
affecting the required transmission rate of the current requests. For the
formulated game, it is shown that a unique fair proper mixed Nash equilibrium
(PMNE) exists. Self-organizing reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed and
proved to converge to a unique Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium which approximates
the desired PMNE. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed
approach can be close to that of the ideal optimal algorithm while it
outperforms a centralized greedy approach in terms of the amount of data that
is cached without jeopardizing the quality-of-service of current requests.

 <dc:description>  Cognitive arithmetic studies the mental processes used in solving math
problems. This area of research explores the retrieval mechanisms and
strategies used by people during a common cognitive task. Past research has
shown that human performance in arithmetic operations is correlated to the
numerical size of the problem. Past research on cognitive arithmetic has
pinpointed this trend to either retrieval strength, error checking, or
strategy-based approaches when solving equations. This paper describes a
rule-based computational model that performs the four major arithmetic
operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) on two
operands. We then evaluated our model to probe its validity in representing the
prevailing concepts observed in psychology experiments from the related works.
The experiments specifically explore the problem size effect, an
activation-based model for fact retrieval, backup strategies when retrieval
fails, and finally optimization strategies when faced with large operands. From
our experimental results, we concluded that our model's response times were
comparable to results observed when people performed similar tasks during
psychology experiments. The fit of our model in reproducing these results and
incorporating accuracy into our model are discussed.

 <dc:description>  The state-of-the-art online learning approaches are only capable of learning
the metric for predefined tasks. In this paper, we consider lifelong learning
problem to mimic &quot;human learning&quot;, i.e., endowing a new capability to the
learned metric for a new task from new online samples and incorporating
previous experiences and knowledge. Therefore, we propose a new metric learning
framework: lifelong metric learning (LML), which only utilizes the data of the
new task to train the metric model while preserving the original capabilities.
More specifically, the proposed LML maintains a common subspace for all learned
metrics, named lifelong dictionary, transfers knowledge from the common
subspace to each new metric task with task-specific idiosyncrasy, and redefines
the common subspace over time to maximize performance across all metric tasks.
For model optimization, we apply online passive aggressive optimization
algorithm to solve the proposed LML framework, where the lifelong dictionary
and task-specific partition are optimized alternatively and consecutively.
Finally, we evaluate our approach by analyzing several multi-task metric
learning datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed framework.

 <dc:description>  It is generally accepted that, when moving in groups, animals process
information to coordinate their motion. Recent studies have begun to apply
rigorous methods based on Information Theory to quantify such distributed
computation. Following this perspective, we use transfer entropy to quantify
dynamic information flows locally in space and time across a school of fish
during directional changes around a circular tank, i.e. U-turns. This analysis
reveals peaks in information flows during collective U-turns and identifies two
different flows: an informative flow (positive transfer entropy) based on fish
that have already turned about fish that are turning, and a misinformative flow
(negative transfer entropy) based on fish that have not turned yet about fish
that are turning. We also reveal that the information flows are related to
relative position and alignment between fish, and identify spatial patterns of
information and misinformation cascades. This study offers several
methodological contributions and we expect further application of these
methodologies to reveal intricacies of self-organisation in other animal groups
and active matter in general.

 <dc:description>  Multi-party Conversational Systems are systems with natural language
interaction between one or more people or systems. From the moment that an
utterance is sent to a group, to the moment that it is replied in the group by
a member, several activities must be done by the system: utterance
understanding, information search, reasoning, among others. In this paper we
present the challenges of designing and building multi-party conversational
systems, the state of the art, our proposed hybrid architecture using both
rules and machine learning and some insights after implementing and evaluating
one on the finance domain.

 <dc:description>  To analyze marine animals behavior, seasonal distribution and abundance,
digital imagery can be acquired by visual or Lidar camera. Depending on the
quantity and properties of acquired imagery, the animals are characterized as
either features (shape, color, texture, etc.), or dissimilarity matrices
derived from different shape analysis methods (shape context, internal distance
shape context, etc.). For both cases, multi-view learning is critical in
integrating more than one set of feature or dissimilarity matrix for higher
classification accuracy. This paper adopts correntropy loss as cost function in
multi-view learning, which has favorable statistical properties for rejecting
noise. For the case of features, the correntropy loss-based multi-view learning
and its entrywise variation are developed based on the multi-view intact space
learning algorithm. For the case of dissimilarity matrices, the robust
Euclidean embedding algorithm is extended to its multi-view form with the
correntropy loss function. Results from simulated data and real-world marine
animal imagery show that the proposed algorithms can effectively enhance
classification rate, as well as suppress noise under different noise
conditions.

 <dc:description>  Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field. Given two irreducible polynomials $f,g$
over $\mathbb{F}_q$, with $\mathrm{deg} f$ dividing $\mathrm{deg} g$, the
finite field embedding problem asks to compute an explicit description of a
field embedding of $\mathbb{F}_q[X]/f(X)$ into $\mathbb{F}_q[Y]/g(Y)$. When
$\mathrm{deg} f = \mathrm{deg} g$, this is also known as the isomorphism
problem.
  This problem, a special instance of polynomial factorization, plays a central
role in computer algebra software. We review previous algorithms, due to
Lenstra, Allombert, Rains, and Narayanan, and propose improvements and
generalizations. Our detailed complexity analysis shows that our newly proposed
variants are at least as efficient as previously known algorithms, and in many
cases significantly better.
  We also implement most of the presented algorithms, compare them with the
state of the art computer algebra software, and make the code available as open
source. Our experiments show that our new variants consistently outperform
available software.

 <dc:description>  The topological containment problem is known to be polynomial-time solvable
for any fixed pattern graph $H$, but good characterisations have been found for
only a handful of non-trivial pattern graphs. The complete graph on five
vertices, $K_5$, is one pattern graph for which a characterisation has not been
found. The discovery of such a characterisation would be of particular
interest, due to the Haj\'os Conjecture. One step towards this may be to find a
good characterisation of graphs that do not topologically contain the simpler
pattern graph $K_5^-$, obtained by removing a single edge from $K_5$.
  This paper makes progress towards achieving this, by showing that every
4-connected graph must contain a $K_5^-$-subdivision.

 <dc:description>  The x86isa library, incorporated in the ACL2 community books project,
provides a formal model of the x86 instruction-set architecture and supports
reasoning about x86 machine-code programs. However, analyzing x86 programs can
be daunting -- even for those familiar with program verification, in part due
to the complexity of the x86 ISA. Furthermore, the x86isa library is a large
framework, and using and/or contributing to it may not seem straightforward. We
present some typical ways of working with the x86isa library, and describe some
of its salient features that can make the analysis of x86 machine-code programs
less arduous. We also discuss some capabilities that are currently missing from
these books -- we hope that this will encourage the community to get involved
in this project.

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Number Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an elementary proof of the group properties of the elliptic curve
known as &quot;Curve25519&quot;, as a component of a comprehensive proof of correctness
of a hardware implementation of the associated Diffie-Hellman key agreement
algorithm. The entire proof has been formalized and mechanically verified with
ACL2, and is computationally surveyable in the sense that all steps that
require mechanical support are presented in such a way that they may readily
reproduced in any suitable programming language.

 <dc:title>Meta-extract: Using Existing Facts in Meta-reasoning</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  ACL2 has long supported user-defined simplifiers, so-called metafunctions and
clause processors, which are installed when corresponding rules of class :meta
or :clause-processor are proved. Historically, such simplifiers could access
the logical world at execution time and could call certain built-in proof
tools, but one could not assume the soundness of the proof tools or the truth
of any facts extracted from the world or context when proving a simplifier
correct. Starting with ACL2 Version 6.0, released in December 2012, an
additional capability was added which allows the correctness proofs of
simplifiers to assume the correctness of some such proof tools and extracted
facts. In this paper we explain this capability and give examples that
demonstrate its utility.

 <dc:description>  We present a tool, simplify-defun, that transforms the definition of a given

checked by ACL2 that the old and new functions are equivalent. When appropriate
it also generates termination and guard proofs for the new function. We explain

illustrate its utility, in particular for program transformation in synthesis

 <dc:title>Deterministic Distributed Construction of $T$-Dominating Sets in Time
  $T$</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Miller, Avery</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Pelc, Andrzej</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A $k$-dominating set is a set $D$ of nodes of a graph such that, for each
node $v$, there exists a node $w \in D$ at distance at most $k$ from $v$. Our
aim is the deterministic distributed construction of small $T$-dominating sets
in time $T$ in networks modeled as undirected $n$-node graphs and under the
$\cal{LOCAL}$ communication model.
  For any positive integer $T$, if $b$ is the size of a pairwise disjoint
collection of balls of radii at least $T$ in a graph, then $b$ is an obvious
lower bound on the size of a $T$-dominating set. Our first result shows that,
even on rings, it is impossible to construct a $T$-dominating set of size $s$
asymptotically $b$ (i.e., such that $s/b \rightarrow 1$) in time $T$.
  In the range of time $T \in \Theta (\log^* n)$, the size of a $T$-dominating
set turns out to be very sensitive to multiplicative constants in running time.
Indeed, it follows from \cite{KP}, that for time $T=\gamma \log^* n$ with large
constant $\gamma$, it is possible to construct a $T$-dominating set whose size
is a small fraction of $n$. By contrast, we show that, for time $T=\alpha
\log^* n $ for small constant $\alpha$, the size of a $T$-dominating set must
be a large fraction of $n$.
  Finally, when $T \in o (\log^* n)$, the above lower bound implies that, for
any constant $x&lt;1$, it is impossible to construct a $T$-dominating set of size
smaller than $xn$, even on rings. On the positive side, we provide an algorithm
that constructs a $T$-dominating set of size $n- \Theta(T)$ on all graphs.

 <dc:description>  We present a series of definitions and theorems demonstrating how to reduce
the requirements for proving system refinements ensuring containment of fair
stuttering runs. A primary result of the work is the ability to reduce the
requisite proofs on runs of a system of interacting state machines to a set of
definitions and checks on single steps of a small number of state machines
corresponding to the intuitive notions of freedom from starvation and deadlock.
We further refine the definitions to afford an efficient explicit-state
checking procedure in certain finite state cases. We demonstrate the proof
reduction on versions of the Bakery Algorithm.

 <dc:title>Term-Level Reasoning in Support of Bit-blasting</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Swords, Sol</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  GL is a verified tool for proving ACL2 theorems using Boolean methods such as
BDD reasoning and satisfiability checking. In its typical operation, GL
recursively traverses a term, computing a symbolic object representing the
value of each subterm. In older versions of GL, such a symbolic object could
use Boolean functions to compactly represent many possible values for integer
and Boolean subfields, but otherwise needed to reflect the concrete structure
of all possiblealues that its term might take. When a term has many possible
values that can't share such a representation, this can easily cause blowups
because GL must then case-split. To address this problem, we have added several
features to GL that allow it to reason about term-like symbolic objects using
various forms of rewriting. These features allow GL to be programmed with rules
much like the ACL2 rewriter, so that users may choose a better normal form for
terms for which the default, value-like representation would otherwise cause
case explosions. In this paper we describe these new features; as a motivating
example, we show how to program the rewriter to reason effectively about the
theory of records.

 <dc:description>  The massive amounts of machine-type user equipments (UEs) will be supported
in the future fifth generation (5G) networks. However, the potential large
random access (RA) delay calls for a new RA scheme and for a detailed
assessment of its performance. Motivated by the key idea of non-orthogonal
multiple access, the non-orthogonal random access (NORA) scheme based on
successive interference cancellation (SIC) is proposed in this paper to
alleviate the access congestion problem. Specifically, NORA utilizes the
difference of time of arrival to identify multiple UEs with the identical
preamble, and enables power domain multiplexing of collided UEs in the
following access process, while the base station performs SIC based on the
channel conditions obtained through preamble detection. Our analysis show that
the performance of NORA is superior to the conventional orthogonal random
access (ORA) scheme in terms of the preamble collision probability, access
success probability and throughput of random access. Simulation results verify
our analysis and further show that our NORA scheme can improve the number of
the supported UEs by more than 30%. Moreover, the number of preamble
transmissions and the access delay for successfully accessed UEs are also
reduced significantly by using the proposed random access scheme.

 <dc:description>  Orthology and paralogy relations are often inferred by methods based on gene
similarity, which usually yield a graph depicting the relationships between
gene pairs. Such relation graphs are known to frequently contain errors, as
they cannot be explained via a gene tree that both contains the depicted
orthologs/paralogs, and that is consistent with a species tree $S$. This idea
of detecting errors through inconsistency with a species tree has mostly been
studied in the presence of speciation and duplication events only. In this
work, we ask: could the given set of relations be consistent if we allow
lateral gene transfers in the evolutionary model? We formalize this question
and provide a variety of algorithmic results regarding the underlying problems.
Namely, we show that deciding if a relation graph $R$ is consistent with a
given species network $N$ is NP-hard, and that it is W[1]-hard under the
parameter &quot;minimum number of transfers&quot;. However, we present an FPT algorithm
based on the degree of the $DS$-tree associated with $R$. We also study
analogous problems in the case that the transfer highways on a species tree are
unknown.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a simple but effective semantic part-based
weighting aggregation (PWA) for image retrieval. The proposed PWA utilizes the
discriminative filters of deep convolutional layers as part detectors.
Moreover, we propose the effective unsupervised strategy to select some part
detectors to generate the &quot;probabilistic proposals&quot;, which highlight certain
discriminative parts of objects and suppress the noise of background. The final
global PWA representation could then be acquired by aggregating the regional
representations weighted by the selected &quot;probabilistic proposals&quot;
corresponding to various semantic content. We conduct comprehensive experiments
on four standard datasets and show that our unsupervised PWA outperforms the
state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised aggregation methods. Code is
available at https://github.com/XJhaoren/PWA.

 <dc:description>  A number of visual question answering approaches have been proposed recently,
aiming at understanding the visual scenes by answering the natural language
questions. While the image question answering has drawn significant attention,
video question answering is largely unexplored.
  Video-QA is different from Image-QA since the information and the events are
scattered among multiple frames. In order to better utilize the temporal
structure of the videos and the phrasal structures of the answers, we propose
two mechanisms: the re-watching and the re-reading mechanisms and combine them
into the forgettable-watcher model. Then we propose a TGIF-QA dataset for video
question answering with the help of automatic question generation. Finally, we
evaluate the models on our dataset. The experimental results show the
effectiveness of our proposed models.

 <dc:creator>Foroosh, Hassan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multiview super-resolution image reconstruction (SRIR) is often cast as a
resampling problem by merging non-redundant data from multiple low-resolution
(LR) images on a finer high-resolution (HR) grid, while inverting the effect of
the camera point spread function (PSF). One main problem with multiview methods
is that resampling from nonuniform samples (provided by LR images) and the
inversion of the PSF are highly nonlinear and ill-posed problems. Non-linearity
and ill-posedness are typically overcome by linearization and regularization,
often through an iterative optimization process, which essentially trade off
the very same information (i.e. high frequency) that we want to recover. We
propose a novel point of view for multiview SRIR: Unlike existing multiview
methods that reconstruct the entire spectrum of the HR image from the multiple
given LR images, we derive explicit expressions that show how the
high-frequency spectra of the unknown HR image are related to the spectra of
the LR images. Therefore, by taking any of the LR images as the reference to
represent the low-frequency spectra of the HR image, one can reconstruct the
super-resolution image by focusing only on the reconstruction of the
high-frequency spectra. This is very much like single-image methods, which
extrapolate the spectrum of one image, except that we rely on information
provided by all other views, rather than by prior constraints as in
single-image methods (which may not be an accurate source of information). This
is made possible by deriving and applying explicit closed-form expressions that
define how the local high frequency information that we aim to recover for the
reference high resolution image is related to the local low frequency
information in the sequence of views. Results and comparisons with recently
published state-of-the-art methods show the superiority of the proposed
solution.

 <dc:description>  Channel Bonding (CB) is a technique used to provide larger bandwidth to
users. It has been applied to various networks such as wireless local area
networks (WLANs), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Cognitive Radio Networks
(CRNs), and Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSNs). The implementation of CB
in CRSNs needs special attention as Primary Radio (PR) nodes traffic must be
protected from any harmful interference by Cognitive Radio (CR) nodes. On the
other hand, CR nodes need to communicate without interruption to meet their
data rate requirements. If CR nodes perform frequent channel switching due to
PR traffic then it will be difficult to meet their quality of service (QoS) and
data rate requirements. So, CR nodes need to select those channels which are
stable. By stable, we mean those channels which cause less harmful interference
to PR nodes and having less PR activity or long remaining idle time. In this
paper, we propose our two approaches Remaining Idle Time aware intelligent
Channel Bonding (RITCB) and Remaining Idle Time aware Intelligent Channel
Bonding with Interference Prevention (RITCB-IP) for cognitive radio sensor
networks which select those channels for CB which have longest remaining idle
time. We compare our approaches with four schemes PRACB, SWA, KNOWS and AGILE.
Simulation results show that our proposed approaches RITCB and RITCB-IP
decrease harmful interference (HIR) and increases the life time of cognitive
radio sensor nodes.

 <dc:title>Amortized Inference and Learning in Latent Conditional Random Fields for
  Weakly-Supervised Semantic Image Segmentation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Conditional random fields (CRFs) are commonly employed as a post-processing
tool for image segmentation tasks. The unary potentials of the CRF are often
learnt independently by a classifier, thereby decoupling the inference in CRF
from the training of classifier. Such a scheme works effectively, when
pixel-level labelling is available for all the images. However, in absence of
pixel-level labels, the classifier is faced with the uphill task of selectively
assigning the image-level labels to the pixels of the image. Prior work often
relied on localization cues, such as saliency maps, objectness priors, bounding
boxes etc., to address this challenging problem. In contrast, we model the
labels of the pixels as latent variables of a CRF. The pixels and the
image-level labels are the observed variables of the latent CRF. We amortize
the cost of inference in the latent CRF over the entire dataset, by training an
inference network to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent
variables given the observed variables. The inference network can be trained in
an end-to-end fashion, and requires no localization cues for training.
Moreover, unlike other approaches for weakly-supervised segmentation, the
proposed model doesn't require further post-processing. The proposed model
achieves performance comparable with other approaches that employ saliency
masks for the task of weakly-supervised semantic image segmentation on the
challenging VOC 2012 dataset.

 <dc:description>  While ray tracing has become increasingly common and path tracing is well
understood by now, a major challenge lies in crafting an easy-to-use and
efficient system implementing these technologies. Following a purely
physically-based paradigm while still allowing for artistic workflows, the Iray
light transport simulation and rendering system allows for rendering complex
scenes by the push of a button and thus makes accurate light transport
simulation widely available. In this document we discuss the challenges and
implementation choices that follow from our primary design decisions,
demonstrating that such a rendering system can be made a practical, scalable,
and efficient real-world application that has been adopted by various companies
across many fields and is in use by many industry professionals today.

 <dc:description>  Word clusters have been empirically shown to offer important performance
improvements on various tasks. Despite their importance, their incorporation in
the standard pipeline of feature engineering relies more on a trial-and-error
procedure where one evaluates several hyper-parameters, like the number of
clusters to be used. In order to better understand the role of such features we
systematically evaluate their effect on four tasks, those of named entity
segmentation and classification as well as, those of five-point sentiment
classification and quantification. Our results strongly suggest that cluster
membership features improve the performance.

 <dc:description>  The proven efficacy of learning-based control schemes strongly motivates
their application to robotic systems operating in the physical world. However,
guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently an
unresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems.
  We propose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability
methods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. The
method exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guarantee
constraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process.
We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis as
the system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness when
appropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-time validation. The
result is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenes
only when (a) the computed safety guarantees require it, or (b) confidence in
the computed guarantees decays in light of new observations.
  We prove theoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case
analysis and demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor
vehicle. Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, the
quadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policy-gradient
reinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from a
strong external disturbance introduced during flight.

 <dc:description>  While representation learning aims to derive interpretable features for
describing visual data, representation disentanglement further results in such
features so that particular image attributes can be identified and manipulated.
However, one cannot easily address this task without observing ground truth
annotation for the training data. To address this problem, we propose a novel
deep learning model of Cross-Domain Representation Disentangler (CDRD). By
observing fully annotated source-domain data and unlabeled target-domain data
of interest, our model bridges the information across data domains and
transfers the attribute information accordingly. Thus, cross-domain joint
feature disentanglement and adaptation can be jointly performed. In the
experiments, we provide qualitative results to verify our disentanglement
capability. Moreover, we further confirm that our model can be applied for
solving classification tasks of unsupervised domain adaptation, and performs
favorably against state-of-the-art image disentanglement and translation
methods.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach for the verification of feed-forward neural networks
in which all nodes have a piece-wise linear activation function. Such networks
are often used in deep learning and have been shown to be hard to verify for
modern satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) and integer linear programming (ILP)
solvers.
  The starting point of our approach is the addition of a global linear
approximation of the overall network behavior to the verification problem that
helps with SMT-like reasoning over the network behavior. We present a
specialized verification algorithm that employs this approximation in a search
process in which it infers additional node phases for the non-linear nodes in
the network from partial node phase assignments, similar to unit propagation in
classical SAT solving. We also show how to infer additional conflict clauses
and safe node fixtures from the results of the analysis steps performed during
the search. The resulting approach is evaluated on collision avoidance and
handwritten digit recognition case studies.

 <dc:title>On-The-Fly Secure Key Generation with Deterministic Models</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is well-known that wireless channel reciprocity together with fading can
be exploited to generate a common secret key between two legitimate
communication partners. This can be achieved by exchanging known deterministic
pilot signals between both partners from which the random fading gains can be
estimated and processed. However, the entropy and thus quality of the generated
key depends on the channel coherence time. This can result in poor key
generation rates in a low mobility environment, where the fading gains are
nearly constant. Therefore, wide-spread deployment of wireless channel-based
secret key generation is limited. To overcome these issues, we follow up on a
recent idea which uses unknown random pilots and enables &quot;on-the-fly&quot; key
generation. In addition, the scheme is able to incorporate local sources of
randomness but performance bounds are hard to obtain with standard methods. In
this paper, we analyse such a scheme analytically and derive achievable key
rates in the Alice-Bob-Eve setting. For this purpose, we develop a novel
approximation model which is inspired by the linear deterministic and the lower
triangular deterministic model. Using this model, we can derive key rates for
specific scenarios. We claim that our novel approach provides an intuitive and
clear framework to analyse similar key generation problems.

 <dc:description>  This is a complementary document to the paper presented in [1], to provide
more detailed proofs for some results. The main paper addresses the problem of
trajectory tracking control of autonomous rotorcraft in operation scenarios
where only relative position measurements obtained from LiDAR sensors are
possible. The proposed approach defines an alternative kinematic model,
directly based on LiDAR measurements, and uses a trajectory-dependent error
space to express the dynamic model of the vehicle. An LPV representation with
piecewise affine dependence on the parameters is adopted to describe the error
dynamics over a set of predefined operating regions, and a continuous-time
$H_2$ control problem is solved using LMIs and implemented within the scope of
gain-scheduling control theory.

 <dc:description>  We present a new method of identifying a specific module in a dynamic
network, possibly with feedback loops. Assuming known topology, we express the
dynamics by an acyclic network composed of two blocks where the first block
accounts for the relation between the known reference signals and the input to
the target module, while the second block contains the target module. Using an
empirical Bayes approach, we model the first block as a Gaussian vector with
covariance matrix (kernel) given by the recently introduced stable spline
kernel. The parameters of the target module are estimated by solving a marginal
likelihood problem with a novel iterative scheme based on the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Additionally, we extend the method to
include additional measurements downstream of the target module. Using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo techniques, it is shown that the same iterative scheme can
solve also this formulation. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness
of the proposed methods.

 <dc:title>A Content-based Centrality Metric for Collaborative Caching in

 <dc:description>  Information-Centric Fog Computing enables a multitude of nodes near the
end-users to provide storage, communication, and computing, rather than in the
cloud. In a fog network, nodes connect with each other directly to get content
locally whenever possible. As the topology of the network directly influences
the nodes' connectivity, there has been some work to compute the graph
centrality of each node within that network topology. The centrality is then
used to distinguish nodes in the fog network, or to prioritize some nodes over
others to participate in the caching fog. We argue that, for an
Information-Centric Fog Computing approach, graph centrality is not an
appropriate metric. Indeed, a node with low connectivity that caches a lot of
content may provide a very valuable role in the network.
  To capture this, we introduce acontent-based centrality (CBC) metric which
takes into account how well a node is connected to the content the network is
delivering, rather than to the other nodes in the network. To illustrate the
validity of considering content-based centrality, we use this new metric for a
collaborative caching algorithm. We compare the performance of the proposed
collaborative caching with typical centrality based, non-centrality based, and
non-collaborative caching mechanisms. Our simulation implements CBC on three
instances of large scale realistic network topology comprising 2,896 nodes with
three content replication levels. Results shows that CBC outperforms benchmark
caching schemes and yields a roughly 3x improvement for the average cache hit
rate.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has been widely applied for sequence modeling.
In RNN, the hidden states at current step are full connected to those at
previous step, thus the influence from less related features at previous step
may potentially decrease model's learning ability. We propose a simple
technique called parallel cells (PCs) to enhance the learning ability of
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In each layer, we run multiple small RNN cells
rather than one single large cell. In this paper, we evaluate PCs on 2 tasks.
On language modeling task on PTB (Penn Tree Bank), our model outperforms state
of art models by decreasing perplexity from 78.6 to 75.3. On Chinese-English
translation task, our model increases BLEU score for 0.39 points than baseline

 <dc:title>Optical Flow in Mostly Rigid Scenes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The optical flow of natural scenes is a combination of the motion of the
observer and the independent motion of objects. Existing algorithms typically
focus on either recovering motion and structure under the assumption of a
purely static world or optical flow for general unconstrained scenes. We
combine these approaches in an optical flow algorithm that estimates an
explicit segmentation of moving objects from appearance and physical
constraints. In static regions we take advantage of strong constraints to
jointly estimate the camera motion and the 3D structure of the scene over
multiple frames. This allows us to also regularize the structure instead of the
motion. Our formulation uses a Plane+Parallax framework, which works even under
small baselines, and reduces the motion estimation to a one-dimensional search
problem, resulting in more accurate estimation. In moving regions the flow is
treated as unconstrained, and computed with an existing optical flow method.
The resulting Mostly-Rigid Flow (MR-Flow) method achieves state-of-the-art
results on both the MPI-Sintel and KITTI-2015 benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we aim to understand whether current language and vision
(LaVi) models truly grasp the interaction between the two modalities. To this
end, we propose an extension of the MSCOCO dataset, FOIL-COCO, which associates
images with both correct and &quot;foil&quot; captions, that is, descriptions of the
image that are highly similar to the original ones, but contain one single
mistake (&quot;foil word&quot;). We show that current LaVi models fall into the traps of
this data and perform badly on three tasks: a) caption classification (correct
vs. foil); b) foil word detection; c) foil word correction. Humans, in
contrast, have near-perfect performance on those tasks. We demonstrate that
merely utilising language cues is not enough to model FOIL-COCO and that it
challenges the state-of-the-art by requiring a fine-grained understanding of
the relation between text and image.

 <dc:title>Rotation Averaging and Strong Duality</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we explore the role of duality principles within the problem of
rotation averaging, a fundamental task in a wide range of computer vision
applications. In its conventional form, rotation averaging is stated as a
minimization over multiple rotation constraints. As these constraints are
non-convex, this problem is generally considered challenging to solve globally.
We show how to circumvent this difficulty through the use of Lagrangian
duality. While such an approach is well-known it is normally not guaranteed to
provide a tight relaxation. Based on spectral graph theory, we analytically
prove that in many cases there is no duality gap unless the noise levels are
severe. This allows us to obtain certifiably global solutions to a class of
important non-convex problems in polynomial time.
  We also propose an efficient, scalable algorithm that out-performs general
purpose numerical solvers and is able to handle the large problem instances
commonly occurring in structure from motion settings. The potential of this
proposed method is demonstrated on a number of different problems, consisting
of both synthetic and real-world data.

 <dc:description>  We consider approximations of 1D Lipschitz functions by deep ReLU networks of

selection the uniform approximation error is lower than with this assumption at
least by a factor logarithmic in the size of the network.

 <dc:title>Experimental Comparison of Probabilistic Shaping Methods for Unrepeated

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the impact of probabilistic shaping on effective
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and achievable information rates (AIRs) in a
back-to-back configuration and in unrepeated nonlinear fiber transmissions. For
back-to-back, various shaped quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
distributions are found to have the same implementation penalty as uniform
input. By demonstrating in transmission experiments that shaped QAM input leads
to lower effective SNR than uniform input at a fixed average launch power, we
experimentally confirm that shaping enhances the fiber nonlinearities. However,
shaping is ultimately found to increase the AIR, which is the most relevant
figure of merit as it is directly related to spectral efficiency. In a detailed
study of these shaping gains for the nonlinear fiber channel, four strategies
for optimizing QAM input distributions are evaluated and experimentally
compared in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems. The first shaping
scheme generates a Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) distribution based on a linear
additive white Gaussian noise channel. The second strategy uses the
Blahut-Arimoto algorithm to optimize an unconstrained QAM distribution for a
split-step Fourier method based channel model. In the third and fourth
approach, MB-shaped QAM and unconstrained QAM are optimized via the enhanced
Gaussian noise (EGN) model. Although the absolute shaping gains are found to be
relatively small, the relative improvements by EGN-optimized unconstrained
distributions over linear AWGN optimized MB distributions are up to 59%. This
general behavior is observed in 9-channel and fully loaded WDM experiments.

 <dc:title>Representing ($q$--)hypergeometric products and mixed versions in
  difference rings</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ocansey, Evans Doe</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Schneider, Carsten</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Symbolic Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years, Karr's difference field theory has been extended to the
so-called $R\Pi\Sigma$-extensions in which one can represent not only
indefinite nested sums and products that can be expressed by transcendental
ring extensions, but one can also handle algebraic products of the form
$\alpha^n$ where $\alpha$ is a root of unity. In this article we supplement
this summation theory substantially by the following building block. We provide
new algorithms that represent a finite number of hypergeometric or mixed
$(q_1,...,q_e)$-multibasic hypergeometric products in such a difference ring.
This new insight provides a complete summation machinery that enables one to
formulate such products and indefinite nested sums defined over such products
in $R\Pi\Sigma$-extensions fully automatically. As a side-product, one obtains
compactified expressions where the products are algebraically independent among
each other, and one can solve the zero-recognition problem for such products.

 <dc:title>Weakly-supervised Visual Grounding of Phrases with Linguistic Structures</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a weakly-supervised approach that takes image-sentence pairs as
input and learns to visually ground (i.e., localize) arbitrary linguistic
phrases, in the form of spatial attention masks. Specifically, the model is
trained with images and their associated image-level captions, without any
explicit region-to-phrase correspondence annotations. To this end, we introduce
an end-to-end model which learns visual groundings of phrases with two types of
carefully designed loss functions. In addition to the standard discriminative
loss, which enforces that attended image regions and phrases are consistently
encoded, we propose a novel structural loss which makes use of the parse tree
structures induced by the sentences. In particular, we ensure complementarity
among the attention masks that correspond to sibling noun phrases, and
compositionality of attention masks among the children and parent phrases, as
defined by the sentence parse tree. We validate the effectiveness of our
approach on the Microsoft COCO and Visual Genome datasets.

 <dc:title>Fast Real-Time DC State Estimation in Electric Power Systems Using
  Belief Propagation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cosovic, Mirsad</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a fast real-time state estimator based on the belief propagation
algorithm for the power system state estimation. The proposed estimator is easy
to distribute and parallelize, thus alleviating computational limitations and
allowing for processing measurements in real time. The presented algorithm may
run as a continuous process, with each new measurement being seamlessly
processed by the distributed state estimator. In contrast to the matrix-based
state estimation methods, the belief propagation approach is robust to
ill-conditioned scenarios caused by significant differences between measurement
variances, thus resulting in a solution that eliminates observability analysis.
Using the DC model, we numerically demonstrate the performance of the state
estimator in a realistic real-time system model with asynchronous measurements.
We note that the extension to the AC state estimation is possible within the
same framework.
