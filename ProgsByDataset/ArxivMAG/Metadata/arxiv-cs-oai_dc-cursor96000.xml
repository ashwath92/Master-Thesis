 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the energy efficiency (EE) of a downlink multi-cell
massive distributed antenna system (DAS) in the presence of pilot contamination
(PC), where the antennas are clustered on the remote radio heads (RRHs). We
employ a practical power consumption model by considering the transmit power,
the circuit power, and the backhaul power, in contrast to most of the existing
works which focus on co-located antenna systems (CAS) where the backhaul power
is negligible. For a given average user rate, we consider the problem of
maximizing the EE with respect to the number of each RRH antennas $n$, the
number of RRHs $M$, the number of users $K$, and study the impact of system
parameters on the optimal $n$, $M$ and $K$. Specifically, by applying random
matrix theory, we derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal $n$, and
find the solution of the optimal $M$ and $K$, under a simplified channel model
with maximum ratio transmission. From the results, we find that to achieve the
optimal EE, a large number of antennas is needed for a given user rate and PC.
As the number of users increases, EE can be improved further by having more
RRHs and antennas. Moreover, if the backhauling power is not large, massive DAS
can be more energy efficient than massive CAS. These insights provide a useful
guide to practical deployment of massive DAS.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we have proposed a basic agent-based model based on
evolutionary dynamics for investigating innovation initiation process. In our
model we suppose each agent will represent a firm which is interacting with
other firms through a given network structure. We consider a two-hit process
for presenting a potentially successful innovation in this model and therefore
at each time step each firm can be in on of three different stages which are
respectively, Ordinary, Innovative, and Successful. We design different
experiments in order to investigate how different interaction networks may
affect the process of presenting a successful innovation to the market. In this
experiments, we use five different network structures, i.e. Erd\H{o}s and
R\'enyi, Ring Lattice, Small World, Scale-Free and Distance-Based networks.
According to the results of the simulations, for less frequent innovations like
radical innovation, local structures are showing a better performance comparing
to Scale-Free and Erd\H{o}s and R\'enyi networks. Although as we move toward
more frequent innovations, like incremental innovations, difference between
network structures becomes less and non-local structures show relatively better
performance.

 <dc:title>On the Performance of Channel Statistics-Based Codebook for Massive MIMO</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The channel feedback overhead for massive MIMO systems with a large number of
base station (BS) antennas is very high, since the number of feedback bits of
traditional codebooks scales linearly with the number of BS antennas. To reduce
the feedback overhead, an effective codebook based on channel statistics has
been designed, where the required number of feedback bits only scales linearly
with the rank of the channel correlation matrix. However, this attractive
conclusion was only intuitively explained and then verified through simulation
results in the literature, while no rigorous theoretical proof has been
provided. To fill in the gap between the theoretical conclusion and simulation
results, in this paper, we quantitatively analyze the performance of the
channel statistics-based codebook. Specifically, we firstly introduce the rate
gap between the ideal case of perfect channel state information at the
transmitter and the practical case of limited channel feedback, where we find
that the rate gap is dependent on the quantization error of the codebook. Then,
we derive an upper bound of the quantization error, based on which we prove
that the required feedback bits to ensure a constant rate gap only scales
linearly with the rank of the channel correlation matrix. Finally, numerical
results are provided to verify this conclusion. To the best of our knowledge,
our work is the first one to provide a rigorous proof of this conclusion.

 <dc:description>  In order to properly assess the function and computational properties of
simulated neural systems, it is necessary to account for the nature of the
stimuli that drive the system. However, providing stimuli that are rich and yet
both reproducible and amenable to experimental manipulations is technically
challenging, and even more so if a closed-loop scenario is required. In this
work, we present a novel approach to solve this problem, connecting robotics
and neural network simulators. We implement a middleware solution that bridges
the Robotic Operating System (ROS) to the Multi-Simulator Coordinator (MUSIC).
This enables any robotic and neural simulators that implement the corresponding
interfaces to be efficiently coupled, allowing real-time performance for a wide
range of configurations. This work extends the toolset available for
researchers in both neurorobotics and computational neuroscience, and creates
the opportunity to perform closed-loop experiments of arbitrary complexity to
address questions in multiple areas, including embodiment, agency, and
reinforcement learning.

 <dc:description>  Learning dictionaries suitable for sparse coding instead of using engineered
bases has proven effective in a variety of image processing tasks. This paper
studies the optimization of dictionaries on image data where the representation
is enforced to be explicitly sparse with respect to a smooth, normalized
sparseness measure. This involves the computation of Euclidean projections onto
level sets of the sparseness measure. While previous algorithms for this
optimization problem had at least quasi-linear time complexity, here the first
algorithm with linear time complexity and constant space complexity is
proposed. The key for this is the mathematically rigorous derivation of a
characterization of the projection's result based on a soft-shrinkage function.
This theory is applied in an original algorithm called Easy Dictionary Learning
(EZDL), which learns dictionaries with a simple and fast-to-compute
Hebbian-like learning rule. The new algorithm is efficient, expressive and
particularly simple to implement. It is demonstrated that despite its
simplicity, the proposed learning algorithm is able to generate a rich variety
of dictionaries, in particular a topographic organization of atoms or separable
atoms. Further, the dictionaries are as expressive as those of benchmark
learning algorithms in terms of the reproduction quality on entire images, and
result in an equivalent denoising performance. EZDL learns approximately 30 %
faster than the already very efficient Online Dictionary Learning algorithm,
and is therefore eligible for rapid data set analysis and problems with vast
quantities of learning samples.

 <dc:description>  An Abstract Graph Machine(AGM) is an abstract model for distributed memory
parallel stabilizing graph algorithms. A stabilizing algorithm starts from a
particular initial state and goes through series of different state changes
until it converges. The AGM adds work dependency to the stabilizing algorithm.
The work is processed within the processing function. All processes in the
system execute the same processing function. Before feeding work into the
processing function, work is ordered using a strict weak ordering relation. The
strict weak ordering relation divides work into equivalence classes, hence work
within a single equivalence class can be processed in parallel, but work in
different equivalence classes must be executed in the order they appear in
equivalence classes. The paper presents the AGM model, semantics and AGM models
for several existing distributed memory parallel graph algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Recently, there have been numerous advances in the development of
biologically inspired lightweight Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). While
autonomous navigation is fairly straight-forward for large UAVs as expensive
sensors and monitoring devices can be employed, robust methods for obstacle
avoidance remains a challenging task for MAVs which operate at low altitude in
cluttered unstructured environments. Due to payload and power constraints, it
is necessary for such systems to have autonomous navigation and flight
capabilities using mostly passive sensors such as cameras. In this paper, we
describe a robust system that enables autonomous navigation of small agile
quad-rotors at low altitude through natural forest environments. We present a
direct depth estimation approach that is capable of producing accurate,
semi-dense depth-maps in real time. Furthermore, a novel wind-resistant control
scheme is presented that enables stable way-point tracking even in the presence
of strong winds. We demonstrate the performance of our system through extensive
experiments on real images and field tests in a cluttered outdoor environment.

 <dc:description>  Funding acknowledgements found in scientific publications have been used to
study the impact of funding on research since the 1970s. However, no broad
scale indexation of that paratextual element was done until 2008, when Thomson
Reuters Web of Science started to add funding acknowledgement information to
its bibliographic records. As this new information provides a new dimension to
bibliometric data that can be systematically exploited, it is important to
understand the characteristics of these data and the underlying implications
for their use. This paper analyses the presence and distribution of funding
acknowledgement data covered in Web of Science. Our results show that prior to
2009 funding acknowledgements coverage is extremely low and therefore not
reliable. Since 2008, funding information has been collected mainly for
publications indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE); more
recently (2015), inclusion of funding texts for publications indexed in the
Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) has been implemented. Arts &amp; Humanities
Citation Index (AHCI) content is not indexed for funding acknowledgement data.
Moreover, English-language publications are the most reliably covered. Finally,
not all types of documents are equally covered for funding information
indexation and only articles and reviews show consistent coverage. The
characterization of the funding acknowledgement information collected by
Thomson Reuters can therefore help understand the possibilities offered by the
data but also their limitations.

 <dc:description>  Human mating is a complex phenomenon. Although men and women have different
preferences in mate selection, there should be compatibility in these
preferences since human mating requires agreement of both parties. We
investigate how compatible the mating preferences of men and women are in a
given property such as age, height, education and income. We use dataset of a
large online dating site (N = 44, 255 users). (i) Our findings are based on the
&quot;actual behavior&quot; of users trying to find a date online, rather than questions
about a &quot;hypothetical&quot; partner as in surveys. (ii) We confirm that women and
men have different mating preferences. Women prefer taller and older men with
better education and higher income then themselves. Men prefer just the
opposite. (iii) Our findings indicate that these differences complement each
other. (iv) Highest compatibility is observed in income with 95 %. This might
be an indication that income is in the process of becoming more important than
other properties, including age, in our modern society. (v) An evolutionary
model is developed which produces similar results.

 <dc:description>  Action classification in still images is an important task in computer
vision. It is challenging as the appearances of ac- tions may vary depending on
their context (e.g. associated objects). Manually labeling of context
information would be time consuming and difficult to scale up. To address this
challenge, we propose a method to automatically discover and cluster action
concepts, and learn their classifiers from weakly supervised image-sentence
corpora. It obtains candidate action concepts by extracting verb-object pairs
from sentences and verifies their visualness with the associated images.
Candidate action concepts are then clustered by using a multi-modal
representation with image embeddings from deep convolutional networks and text
embeddings from word2vec. More than one hundred human action concept
classifiers are learned from the Flickr 30k dataset with no additional human
effort and promising classification results are obtained. We further apply the
AdaBoost algorithm to automatically select and combine relevant action concepts
given an action query. Promising results have been shown on the PASCAL VOC 2012
action classification benchmark, which has zero overlap with Flickr30k.

 <dc:description>  Bio-inspired algorithms like Genetic Algorithms and Fuzzy Inference Systems
(FIS) are nowadays widely adopted as hybrid techniques in commercial and
industrial environment. In this paper we present an interesting application of
the fuzzy-GA paradigm to Smart Grids. The main aim consists in performing
decision making for power flow management tasks in the proposed microgrid model
equipped by renewable sources and an energy storage system, taking into account
the economical profit in energy trading with the main-grid. In particular, this
study focuses on the application of a Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm (HGA) for
tuning the Rule Base (RB) of a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS), trying to discover
a minimal fuzzy rules set in a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) adopted to perform
decision making in the microgrid. The HGA rationale focuses on a particular
encoding scheme, based on control genes and parametric genes applied to the
optimization of the FIS parameters, allowing to perform a reduction in the
structural complexity of the RB. This approach will be referred in the
following as fuzzy-HGA. Results are compared with a simpler approach based on a
classic fuzzy-GA scheme, where both FIS parameters and rule weights are tuned,
while the number of fuzzy rules is fixed in advance. Experiments shows how the
fuzzy-HGA approach adopted for the synthesis of the proposed controller
outperforms the classic fuzzy-GA scheme, increasing the accounting profit by
67\% in the considered energy trading problem yielding at the same time a
simpler RB.

 <dc:description>  A theorem of Eilenberg establishes that there exists a bijection between the
set of all varieties of regular languages and the set of all varieties of
finite monoids. In this article after defining, for a fixed set of sorts $S$
and a fixed $S$-sorted signature $\Sigma$, the concepts of formation of
congruences with respect to $\Sigma$ and of formation of $\Sigma$-algebras, we
prove that the algebraic lattices of all $\Sigma$-congruence formations and of
all $\Sigma$-algebra formations are isomorphic, which is an Eilenberg's type
theorem. Moreover, under a suitable condition on the free $\Sigma$-algebras and
after defining the concepts of formation of congruences of finite index with
respect to $\Sigma$, of formation of finite $\Sigma$-algebras, and of formation
of regular languages with respect to $\Sigma$, we prove that the algebraic
lattices of all $\Sigma$-finite index congruence formations, of all
$\Sigma$-finite algebra formations, and of all $\Sigma$-regular language
formations are isomorphic, which is also an Eilenberg's type theorem.

 <dc:description>  Many Web applications require efficient querying of large Knowledge Graphs
(KGs). We propose KOGNAC, a dictionary-encoding algorithm designed to improve
SPARQL querying with a judicious combination of statistical and semantic
techniques. In KOGNAC, frequent terms are detected with a frequency
approximation algorithm and encoded to maximise compression. Infrequent terms
are semantically grouped into ontological classes and encoded to increase data
locality. We evaluated KOGNAC in combination with state-of-the-art RDF engines,
and observed that it significantly improves SPARQL querying on KGs with up to
1B edges.

 <dc:description>  We present results on combining supervised and unsupervised methods to
ensemble multiple systems for two popular Knowledge Base Population (KBP)
tasks, Cold Start Slot Filling (CSSF) and Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and

features outperforms the best performing system for both tasks in the 2015

two different and challenging problems demonstrates the power and generality of
our combined approach to ensembling.

 <dc:description>  Computation-as-a-Service (CaaS) offerings have gained traction in the last
few years due to their effectiveness in balancing between the scalability of
Software-as-a-Service and the customisation possibilities of
Infrastructure-as-a-Service platforms. To function effectively, a CaaS platform
must have three key properties: (i) reactive assignment of individual
processing tasks to available cloud instances (compute units) according to
availability and predetermined time-to-completion (TTC) constraints; (ii)
accurate resource prediction; (iii) efficient control of the number of cloud
instances servicing workloads, in order to optimize between completing
workloads in a timely fashion and reducing resource utilization costs. In this
paper, we propose three approaches that satisfy these properties
(respectively): (i) a service rate allocation mechanism based on proportional
fairness and TTC constraints; (ii) Kalman-filter estimates for resource
prediction; and (iii) the use of additive increase multiplicative decrease
(AIMD) algorithms (famous for being the resource management in the transport
control protocol) for the control of the number of compute units servicing
workloads. The integration of our three proposals\ into a single CaaS platform
is shown to provide for more than 27% reduction in Amazon EC2 spot instance
cost against methods based on reactive resource prediction and 38% to 60%
reduction of the billing cost against the current state-of-the-art in CaaS
platforms (Amazon Lambda and Autoscale).

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes deep convolutional network models that utilize local and
global context to make human activity label predictions in still images,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on two recent datasets with hundreds of
labels each. We use multiple instance learning to handle the lack of
supervision on the level of individual person instances, and weighted loss to
handle unbalanced training data. Further, we show how specialized features
trained on these datasets can be used to improve accuracy on the Visual
Question Answering (VQA) task, in the form of multiple choice fill-in-the-blank
questions (Visual Madlibs). Specifically, we tackle two types of questions on
person activity and person-object relationship and show improvements over
generic features trained on the ImageNet classification task.

 <dc:description>  We study strategic games on weighted directed graphs, where the payoff of a
player is defined as the sum of the weights on the edges from players who chose
the same strategy augmented by a fixed non-negative bonus for picking a given
strategy. These games capture the idea of coordination in the absence of
globally common strategies. Prior work shows that the problem of determining
the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium for these games is NP-complete already
for graphs with all weights equal to one and no bonuses. However, for several
classes of graphs (e.g. DAGs and cliques) pure Nash equilibria or even strong
equilibria always exist and can be found by simply following a particular
improvement or coalition-improvement path, respectively. In this paper we
identify several natural classes of graphs for which a finite improvement or
coalition-improvement path of polynomial length always exists, and, as a
consequence, a Nash equilibrium or strong equilibrium in them can be found in
polynomial time. We also argue that these results are optimal in the sense that
in natural generalisations of these classes of graphs, a pure Nash equilibrium
may not even exist.

 <dc:title>Using Text Similarity to Detect Social Interactions not Captured by
  Formal Reply Mechanisms</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In modeling social interaction online, it is important to understand when
people are reacting to each other. Many systems have explicit indicators of
replies, such as threading in discussion forums or replies and retweets in
Twitter. However, it is likely these explicit indicators capture only part of
people's reactions to each other, thus, computational social science approaches
that use them to infer relationships or influence are likely to miss the mark.
This paper explores the problem of detecting non-explicit responses, presenting
a new approach that uses tf-idf similarity between a user's own tweets and
recent tweets by people they follow. Based on a month's worth of posting data
from 449 ego networks in Twitter, this method demonstrates that it is likely
that at least 11% of reactions are not captured by the explicit reply and
retweet mechanisms. Further, these uncaptured reactions are not evenly
distributed between users: some users, who create replies and retweets without
using the official interface mechanisms, are much more responsive to followees
than they appear. This suggests that detecting non-explicit responses is an
important consideration in mitigating biases and building more accurate models
when using these markers to study social interaction and information diffusion.

 <dc:description>  This paper aims to improve the feature learning in Convolutional Networks
(Convnet) by capturing the structure of objects. A new sparsity function is
imposed on the extracted featuremap to capture the structure and shape of the
learned object, extracting interpretable features to improve the prediction
performance. The proposed algorithm is based on organizing the activation
within and across featuremap by constraining the node activities through
$\ell_{2}$ and $\ell_{1}$ normalization in a structured form.

 <dc:description>  Scan (or prefix sum) is a fundamental and widely used primitive in parallel
computing. In this paper, we present LightScan, a faster parallel scan
primitive for CUDA-enabled GPUs, which investigates a hybrid model combining
intra-block computation and inter-block communication to perform a scan. Our
algorithm employs warp shuffle functions to implement fast intra-block
computation and takes advantage of globally coherent L2 cache and the
associated parallel thread execution (PTX) assembly instructions to realize
lightweight inter-block communication. Performance evaluation using a single
Tesla K40c GPU shows that LightScan outperforms existing GPU algorithms and
implementations, and yields a speedup of up to 2.1, 2.4, 1.5 and 1.2 over the
leading CUDPP, Thrust, ModernGPU and CUB implementations running on the same
GPU, respectively. Furthermore, LightScan runs up to 8.9 and 257.3 times faster
than Intel TBB running on 16 CPU cores and an Intel Xeon Phi 5110P coprocessor,
respectively. Source code of LightScan is available at
http://cupbb.sourceforge.net.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, an extended large wireless network under the secrecy
constraint is considered. In contrast to works which use idealized assumptions,
a more realistic network situation with unknown eavesdroppers locations is
investigated: the legitimate users only know their own Channel State
Information (CSI), not the eavesdroppers CSI. Also, the network is analyzed by
taking in to account the effects of both fading and path loss. Under these
assumptions, a power efficient cooperative scheme, named \emph{stochastic
virtual beamforming}, is proposed. Applying this scheme, an unbounded secure
rate with any desired outage level is achieved, provided that the density of
the legitimate users tends to infinity. In addition, by tending the legitimate
users density to the infinity, the tolerable density of eavesdroppers will
become unbounded too.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things (IoT) connects everyday objects including a vast array
of sensors, actuators, and smart devices, referred to as things to the
Internet, in an intelligent and pervasive fashion. This connectivity gives rise
to the possibility of using the tracking capabilities of things to impinge on
the location privacy of users. Most of the existing management and location
privacy protection solutions do not consider the low-cost and low-power
requirements of things, or, they do not account for the heterogeneity,
scalability, or autonomy of communications supported in the IoT. Moreover,
these traditional solutions do not consider the case where a user wishes to
control the granularity of the disclosed information based on the context of
their use (e.g. based on the time or the current location of the user). To fill
this gap, a middleware, referred to as the Internet of Things Management
Platform (IoT-MP) is proposed in this paper.

 <dc:title>Visual saliency detection: a Kalman filter based approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Roy, Sourya</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mitra, Pabitra</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a Kalman filter aided saliency detection model which
is based on the conjecture that salient regions are considerably different from
our &quot;visual expectation&quot; or they are &quot;visually surprising&quot; in nature. In this
work, we have structured our model with an immediate objective to predict
saliency in static images. However, the proposed model can be easily extended
for space-time saliency prediction. Our approach was evaluated using two
publicly available benchmark data sets and results have been compared with
other existing saliency models. The results clearly illustrate the superior
performance of the proposed model over other approaches.

 <dc:description>  The h-Index is an important bibliographic measure used to assess the
performance of researchers. Van Bevern et al. [Artif. Intel., to appear] showed
that, despite computational worst-case hardness results, substantial
manipulation of the h-Index of Google Scholar author profiles is possible by
merging articles. Complementing this work, we study the opposite operation, the
splitting of articles, which is arguably the more natural operation for
manipulation and which is also allowed within Google Scholar. We present
numerous results on computational complexity (from linear-time algorithms to
parameterized computational hardness results) and empirically indicate that at
least small improvements of the h-Index by splitting merged articles are easily
achievable.

 <dc:title>A heuristic approach for dividing graphs into bi-connected components

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a new problem of finding the maximal bi-connected
partitioning of a graph with a size constraint (MBCPG-SC). With the goal of
finding approximate solutions for the MBCPG-SC, a heuristic method is developed
based on the open ear decomposition of graphs. Its essential part is an
adaptation of the breadth first search which makes it possible to grow
bi-connected subgraphs. The proposed randomized algorithm consists of growing
several subgraphs in parallel. The quality of solutions generated in this way
is further improved using a local search which exploits neighboring relations
between the subgraphs. In order to evaluate the performance of the method, an
algorithm for generating pseudo-random unit disc graphs with known optimal
solutions is created. The conducted computational experiments show that the
proposed method frequently manages to find optimal solutions and has an average
error of only a few percent to known optimal solutions. Further, it manages to
find high quality approximate solutions for graphs having up to 10.000 nodes in
reasonable time.

 <dc:description>  Receiver algorithms which combine belief propagation (BP) with the mean field
(MF) approximation are well-suited for inference of both continuous and
discrete random variables. In wireless scenarios involving detection of
multiple signals, the standard construction of the combined BP-MF framework
includes the equalization or multi-user detection functions within the MF
subgraph. In this paper, we show that the MF approximation is not particularly
effective for multi-signal detection. We develop a new factor graph
construction for application of the BP-MF framework to problems involving the
detection of multiple signals. We then develop a low-complexity variant to the
proposed construction in which Gaussian BP is applied to the equalization
factors. In this case, the factor graph of the joint probability distribution
is divided into three subgraphs: (i) a MF subgraph comprised of the observation
factors and channel estimation, (ii) a Gaussian BP subgraph which is applied to
multi-signal detection, and (iii) a discrete BP subgraph which is applied to
demodulation and decoding. Expectation propagation is used to approximate
discrete distributions with a Gaussian distribution and links the discrete BP
and Gaussian BP subgraphs. The result is a probabilistic receiver architecture
with strong theoretical justification which can be applied to multi-signal
detection.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge representation is an important, long-history topic in AI, and there
have been a large amount of work for knowledge graph embedding which projects
symbolic entities and relations into low-dimensional, real-valued vector space.
However, most embedding methods merely concentrate on data fitting and ignore
the explicit semantic expression, leading to uninterpretable representations.
Thus, traditional embedding methods have limited potentials for many
applications such as question answering, and entity classification. To this
end, this paper proposes a semantic representation method for knowledge graph
\textbf{(KSR)}, which imposes a two-level hierarchical generative process that
globally extracts many aspects and then locally assigns a specific category in
each aspect for every triple. Since both aspects and categories are
semantics-relevant, the collection of categories in each aspect is treated as
the semantic representation of this triple. Extensive experiments justify our
model outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines substantially.

 <dc:title>Subjects and Their Objects: Localizing Interactees for a Person-Centric
  View of Importance</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Chao-Yeh</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Grauman, Kristen</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Understanding images with people often entails understanding their
\emph{interactions} with other objects or people. As such, given a novel image,
a vision system ought to infer which other objects/people play an important
role in a given person's activity. However, existing methods are limited to
learning action-specific interactions (e.g., how the pose of a tennis player
relates to the position of his racquet when serving the ball) for improved
recognition, making them unequipped to reason about novel interactions with
actions or objects unobserved in the training data.
  We propose to predict the &quot;interactee&quot; in novel images---that is, to localize
the \emph{object} of a person's action. Given an arbitrary image with a
detected person, the goal is to produce a saliency map indicating the most
likely positions and scales where that person's interactee would be found. To
that end, we explore ways to learn the generic, action-independent connections
between (a) representations of a person's pose, gaze, and scene cues and (b)
the interactee object's position and scale. We provide results on a newly
collected UT Interactee dataset spanning more than 10,000 images from SUN,
PASCAL, and COCO. We show that the proposed interaction-informed saliency
metric has practical utility for four tasks: contextual object detection, image
retargeting, predicting object importance, and data-driven natural language
scene description. All four scenarios reveal the value in linking the subject
to its object in order to understand the story of an image.

 <dc:description>  It is known that epipolar geometry can be computed from three epipolar line
correspondences but this computation is rarely used in practice since there are
no simple methods to find corresponding lines. Instead, methods for finding
corresponding points are widely used. This paper proposes a similarity measure
between lines that indicates whether two lines are corresponding epipolar lines
and enables finding epipolar line correspondences as needed for the computation
of epipolar geometry.
  A similarity measure between two lines, suitable for video sequences of a
dynamic scene, has been previously described. This paper suggests a stereo
matching similarity measure suitable for images. It is based on the quality of
stereo matching between the two lines, as corresponding epipolar lines yield a
good stereo correspondence.
  Instead of an exhaustive search over all possible pairs of lines, the search
space is substantially reduced when two corresponding point pairs are given.
  We validate the proposed method using real-world images and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. We found this method to be more accurate by a factor
of five compared to the standard method using seven corresponding points and
comparable to the 8-points algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are capable of spending long periods of
time for carrying out various underwater missions and marine tasks. In this
paper, a novel conflict-free motion planning framework is introduced to enhance
underwater vehicle's mission performance by completing maximum number of
highest priority tasks in a limited time through a large scale waypoint
cluttered operating field, and ensuring safe deployment during the mission. The
proposed combinatorial route-path planner model takes the advantages of the
biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm toward satisfying objectives of
both higher-lower level motion planners and guarantees maximization of the
mission productivity for a single vehicle operation. The performance of the
model is investigated under different scenarios including the particular cost
constraints in time-varying operating fields. To show the reliability of the
proposed model, performance of each motion planner assessed separately and then
statistical analysis is undertaken to evaluate the total performance of the
entire model. The simulation results indicate the stability of the contributed
model and its feasible application for real experiments.

 <dc:description>  An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) needs to acquire a certain degree of
autonomy for any particular underwater mission to fulfill the mission
objectives successfully and ensure its safety in all stages of the mission in a
large scale operating filed. In this paper, a novel combinatorial
conflict-free-task assignment strategy consisting an interactive engagement of
a local path planner and an adaptive global route planner, is introduced. The
method is established upon the heuristic search potency of the Particle Swarm
Optimisation (PSO) algorithm to address the discrete nature of routing-task
assignment approach and the complexity of NP-hard path planning problem. The
proposed hybrid method is highly efficient for having a reactive guidance
framework that guarantees successful completion of missions specifically in
cluttered environments. To examine the performance of the method in a context
of mission productivity, mission time management and vehicle safety, a series
of simulation studies are undertaken. The results of simulations declare that
the proposed method is reliable and robust, particularly in dealing with
uncertainties, and it can significantly enhance the level of vehicle's autonomy
by relying on its reactive nature and capability of providing fast feasible
solutions.

 <dc:description>  Given a graph $Y$ on $n$ vertices and a desired level of fault-tolerance $k$,
an objective in fault-tolerant system design is to construct a supergraph $X$
on $n + k$ vertices such that the removal of any $k$ nodes from $X$ leaves a
graph containing $Y$. In order to reconfigure around faults when they occur, it
is also required that any two subsets of $k$ nodes of $X$ are in the same orbit
of the action of its automorphism group. In this paper, we prove that such a
supergraph must be the complete graph. This implies that it is very expensive
to have an interconnection network which is $k$-fault-tolerant and which also
supports automorphic reconfiguration. Our work resolves an open problem in the
literature. The proof uses a result due to Cameron on $k$-homogeneous groups.

 <dc:description>  The study of mechanisms for multi-sided markets has received an increasingly
growing attention from the research community, and is motivated by the numerous
examples of such markets on the web and in electronic commerce. Many of these
examples represent dynamic and uncertain environments, and thus, require, in
fact, online mechanisms. Unfortunately, as far as we know, no previously
published online mechanism for a multi-sided market (or even for a double-sided
market) has managed to (approximately) maximize the gain from trade, while
guaranteeing desirable economic properties such as incentivizing truthfulness,
voluntary participation and avoiding budget deficit. In this work we present
the first online mechanism for a multi-sided market which has the above
properties. Our mechanism is designed for a market setting suggested by
[Feldman and Gonen (2016)]; which is motivated by the foreseeable future form
of online advertising.
  The online nature of our setting motivated us to define a stronger notion of
individual rationality, called &quot;continuous individual rationality&quot;, capturing
the natural requirement that a player should never lose either by participating
in the mechanism or by not leaving prematurely. Satisfying the requirements of
continuous individual rationality, together with the other economic properties
our mechanism guarantees, requires the mechanism to use a novel pricing scheme
where users may be paid ongoing increments during the mechanism's execution up
to a pre-known maximum value. As users rarely ever get paid in reality, this
pricing scheme is new to mechanism design. Nevertheless, the principle it is
based on can be observed in many common real life scenarios such as executive
compensation payments and company acquisition deals. We believe both our new
dynamic pricing scheme concept and our strengthened notion of individual
rationality are of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  We study energy harvesting (EH) transmitter and receiver, where the receiver
decodes data using the harvested energy from the nature and from an independent
EH node, named helper. Helper cooperates with the receiver by transferring its
harvested energy to the receiver over an orthogonal fading channel. We study an
offline optimal power management policy to maximize the reliable information
rate. The harvested energy in all three nodes are assumed to be known. We
consider four different scenarios; First, for the case that both transmitter
and the receiver have batteries, we show that the optimal policy is
transferring the helper harvested energy to the receiver, immediately. Next,
for the case of non-battery receiver and full power transmitter, we model a
virtual EH receiver with minimum energy constraint to achieve an optimal
policy. Then, we consider a non-battery EH receiver and EH transmitter with
battery. Finally, we derive optimal power management wherein neither the
transmitter nor the receiver have batteries. We propose three iterative
algorithms to compute optimal energy management policies. Numerical results are
presented to corroborate the advantage of employing the helper.

 <dc:title>On the Role of Public and Private Assessments in Security Information
  Sharing Agreements</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In recent years, sharing of security information among organizations,
particularly information on both successful and failed security breaches, has
been proposed as a method for improving the state of cybersecurity. However,
there is a conflict between individual and social goals in these agreements:
despite the benefits of making such information available, the associated
disclosure costs (e.g., drop in market value and loss of reputation) act as a
disincentive for firms' full disclosure. In this work, we take a game theoretic
approach to understanding firms' incentives for disclosing their security
information given such costs. We propose a repeated game formulation of these
interactions, allowing for the design of inter-temporal incentives (i.e.,
conditioning future cooperation on the history of past interactions).
Specifically, we show that a rating/assessment system can play a key role in
enabling the design of appropriate incentives for supporting cooperation among
firms. We further show that in the absence of a monitor, similar incentives can
be designed if participating firms are provided with a communication platform,
through which they can share their beliefs about others' adherence to the
agreement.

 <dc:description>  We study the simplest form of two-sided markets: one seller, one buyer and a
single item for sale. It is well known that there is no fully-efficient
mechanism for this problem that maintains a balanced budget. We characterize
the quality of the most efficient mechanisms that are budget balanced, and
design simple and robust mechanisms with these properties. We also show that
even minimal use of statistical data can yield good results. Finally, we
demonstrate how a mechanism for this simple bilateral-trade problem can be used
as a &quot;black-box&quot; for constructing mechanisms in more general environments.

 <dc:description>  With the massive data challenges nowadays and the rapid growing of
technology, stream mining has recently received considerable attention. To
address the large number of scenarios in which this phenomenon manifests itself
suitable tools are required in various research fields. Instance-based data
stream algorithms generally employ the Euclidean distance for the
classification task underlying this problem. A novel way to look into this
issue is to take advantage of a more flexible metric due to the increased
requirements imposed by the data stream scenario. In this paper we present a
new algorithm that learns a Mahalanobis metric using similarity and
dissimilarity constraints in an online manner. This approach hybridizes a
Mahalanobis distance metric learning algorithm and a k-NN data stream
classification algorithm with concept drift detection. First, some basic
aspects of Mahalanobis distance metric learning are described taking into
account key properties as well as online distance metric learning algorithms.
Second, we implement specific evaluation methodologies and comparative metrics
such as Q statistic for data stream classification algorithms. Finally, our
algorithm is evaluated on different datasets by comparing its results with one
of the best instance-based data stream classification algorithm of the state of
the art. The results demonstrate that our proposal is better

 <dc:description>  We derive theoretical guarantees for the exact recovery of piecewise constant
two-dimensional images from a minimal number of non-uniform Fourier samples
using a convex matrix completion algorithm. We assume the discontinuities of
the image are localized to the zero level-set of a bandlimited function, which
induces certain linear dependencies in Fourier domain, such that a multifold
Toeplitz matrix built from the Fourier data is known to be low-rank. The
recovery algorithm arranges the known Fourier samples into the structured
matrix then attempts recovery of the missing Fourier data by minimizing the
nuclear norm subject to structure and data constraints. This work adapts
results by Chen and Chi on the recovery of isolated Diracs via nuclear norm
minimization of a similar multifold Hankel structure. We show that exact
recovery is possible with high probability when the bandlimited function
describing the edge set satisfies an incoherency property. Finally, we
demonstrate the algorithm on the recovery of undersampled MRI data.

 <dc:description>  In today's digital world, personal data is being continuously collected and
analyzed without data owners' consent and choice. As data owners constantly
generate data on their personal devices, the tension of storing private data on
their own devices yet allowing third party analysts to perform aggregate
analytics yields an interesting dilemma.
  This paper introduces PAS-MC, the first practical privacy-preserving and
anonymity stream analytics system. PAS-MC ensures that each data owner locally
privatizes their sensitive data before responding to analysts' queries. PAS-MC
also protects against traffic analysis attacks with minimal trust
vulnerabilities.We evaluate the scheme over the California Transportation
Dataset and show that we can privately and anonymously stream vehicular
location updates yet preserve high accuracy.

 <dc:title>An Initial Seed Selection Algorithm for K-means Clustering of
  Georeferenced Data to Improve Replicability of Cluster Assignments for
  Mapping Application</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Khan, Fouad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  K-means is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms in various
disciplines, especially for large datasets. However the method is known to be
highly sensitive to initial seed selection of cluster centers. K-means++ has
been proposed to overcome this problem and has been shown to have better
accuracy and computational efficiency than k-means. In many clustering problems
though -such as when classifying georeferenced data for mapping applications-
standardization of clustering methodology, specifically, the ability to arrive
at the same cluster assignment for every run of the method i.e. replicability
of the methodology, may be of greater significance than any perceived measure
of accuracy, especially when the solution is known to be non-unique, as in the
case of k-means clustering. Here we propose a simple initial seed selection
algorithm for k-means clustering along one attribute that draws initial cluster
boundaries along the 'deepest valleys' or greatest gaps in dataset. Thus, it
incorporates a measure to maximize distance between consecutive cluster centers
which augments the conventional k-means optimization for minimum distance
between cluster center and cluster members. Unlike existing initialization
methods, no additional parameters or degrees of freedom are introduced to the
clustering algorithm. This improves the replicability of cluster assignments by
as much as 100% over k-means and k-means++, virtually reducing the variance
over different runs to zero, without introducing any additional parameters to
the clustering process. Further, the proposed method is more computationally
efficient than k-means++ and in some cases, more accurate.

 <dc:description>  Discovering the set of closed frequent patterns is one of the fundamental
problems in Data Mining. Recent Constraint Programming (CP) approaches for
declarative itemset mining have proven their usefulness and flexibility. But
the wide use of reified constraints in current CP approaches raises many
difficulties to cope with high dimensional datasets. This paper proposes CLOSED
PATTERN global constraint which does not require any reified constraints nor
any extra variables to encode efficiently the Closed Frequent Pattern Mining
(CFPM) constraint. CLOSED-PATTERN captures the particular semantics of the CFPM
problem in order to ensure a polynomial pruning algorithm ensuring domain
consistency. The computational properties of our constraint are analyzed and
their practical effectiveness is experimentally evaluated.

 <dc:title>Scaling indicator and planning plane: an indicator and a visual tool for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Ecosystems and other naturally resilient systems exhibit allometric scaling
in the distribution of sizes of their elements. In this paper we define an
allometry inspired scaling indicator for cities that is a first step towards
quantifying the resilience borne of a complex systems' hierarchical structural
composition. The scaling indicator is calculated using large census datasets
and is analogous to fractal dimension in spatial analysis. Lack of numerical
rigor and the resulting variation in scaling indicators -inherent in the use of
box counting mechanism for fractal dimension calculation for cities- has been
one of the hindrances in the adoption of fractal dimension as an urban
indicator of note. The intra-urban indicator of scaling in population density
distribution developed here is calculated for 58 US cities using a methodology
that produces replicable results, employing large census-block wise population
datasets from the 2010 US Census 2010 and the 2007 US Economic Census. We show
that rising disparity -as measured by the proposed indicator of population
density distribution in census blocks in metropolitan statistical areas (using
US Census 2010 data) adversely affects energy consumption efficiency and carbon
emissions in cities and leads to a higher urban carbon footprint. We then
define a planning plane as a visual and analytic tool for incorporation of
scaling indicator analysis into policy and decision-making.

 <dc:description>  This article contributes to the development of methods for analysing research
funding systems by exploring the robustness and comparability of emerging
approaches to generate funding landscapes useful for policy making. We use a
novel dataset of manually extracted and coded data on the funding
acknowledgements of 7,510 publications representing UK cancer research in the
year 2011 and compare these 'reference data' with funding data provided by Web
of Science (WoS) and MEDLINE/PubMed. Findings show high recall (about 93%) of
WoS funding data. By contrast, MEDLINE/PubMed data retrieved less than half of
the UK cancer publications acknowledging at least one funder. Conversely, both
databases have high precision (+90%): i.e. few cases of publications with no
acknowledgement to funders are identified as having funding data. Nonetheless,
funders acknowledged in UK cancer publications were not correctly listed by
MEDLINE/PubMed and WoS in about 75% and 32% of the cases, respectively.
'Reference data' on the UK cancer research funding system are then used as a
case-study to demonstrate the utility of funding data for strategic
intelligence applications (e.g. mapping of funding landscape, comparison of
funders' research portfolios).

 <dc:description>  Systematic validation is an essential part of algorithm development. The
enormous dataset sizes and the complexity observed in many recent time-resolved
3D fluorescence microscopy imaging experiments, however, prohibit a
comprehensive manual ground truth generation. Moreover, existing simulated
benchmarks in this field are often too simple or too specialized to
sufficiently validate the observed image analysis problems. We present a new
semi-synthetic approach to generate realistic 3D+t benchmarks that combines
challenging cellular movement dynamics of real embryos with simulated
fluorescent nuclei and artificial image distortions including various
parametrizable options like cell numbers, acquisition deficiencies or multiview
simulations. We successfully applied the approach to simulate the development
of a zebrafish embryo with thousands of cells over 14 hours of its early
existence.

 <dc:description>  Example-based super-resolution (EBSR) reconstructs a high-resolution image
from a low-resolution image, given a training set of high-resolution images. In
this note I propose some applications of EBSR to medical imaging. A particular
interesting application, which I call &quot;x-ray voxelization&quot;, approximates the
result of a CT scan from an x-ray image.

 <dc:description>  In crowdsourcing when there is a lack of verification for contributed
answers, output agreement mechanisms are often used to incentivize participants
to provide truthful answers when the correct answer is hold by the majority. In
this paper, we focus on using output agreement mechanisms to elicit effort, in
addition to eliciting truthful answers, from a population of workers. We
consider a setting where workers have heterogeneous cost of effort exertion and
examine the data requester's problem of deciding the reward level in output
agreement for optimal elicitation. In particular, when the requester knows the
cost distribution, we derive the optimal reward level for output agreement
mechanisms. This is achieved by first characterizing Bayesian Nash equilibria
of output agreement mechanisms for a given reward level. When the requester
does not know the cost distribution, we develop sequential mechanisms that
combine learning the cost distribution with incentivizing effort exertion to
approximately determine the optimal reward level.

 <dc:description>  Factor analysis aims to determine latent factors, or traits, which summarize
a given data set. Inter-battery factor analysis extends this notion to multiple
views of the data. In this paper we show how a nonlinear, nonparametric version
of these models can be recovered through the Gaussian process latent variable
model. This gives us a flexible formalism for multi-view learning where the
latent variables can be used both for exploratory purposes and for learning
representations that enable efficient inference for ambiguous estimation tasks.
Learning is performed in a Bayesian manner through the formulation of a
variational compression scheme which gives a rigorous lower bound on the log
likelihood. Our Bayesian framework provides strong regularization during
training, allowing the structure of the latent space to be determined
efficiently and automatically. We demonstrate this by producing the first (to
our knowledge) published results of learning from dozens of views, even when
data is scarce. We further show experimental results on several different types
of multi-view data sets and for different kinds of tasks, including exploratory
data analysis, generation, ambiguity modelling through latent priors and
classification.

 <dc:description>  Learning new representations of input observations in machine learning is
often tackled using a factorization of the data. For many such problems,
including sparse coding and matrix completion, learning these factorizations
can be difficult, in terms of efficiency and to guarantee that the solution is
a global minimum. Recently, a general class of objectives have been
introduced-which we term induced dictionary learning models (DLMs)-that have an
induced convex form that enables global optimization. Though attractive
theoretically, this induced form is impractical, particularly for large or
growing datasets. In this work, we investigate the use of practical alternating
minimization algorithms for induced DLMs, that ensure convergence to global
optima. We characterize the stationary points of these models, and, using these
insights, highlight practical choices for the objectives. We then provide
theoretical and empirical evidence that alternating minimization, from a random
initialization, converges to global minima for a large subclass of induced
DLMs. In particular, we take advantage of the existence of the (potentially
unknown) convex induced form, to identify when stationary points are global
minima for the dictionary learning objective. We then provide an empirical
investigation into practical optimization choices for using alternating
minimization for induced DLMs, for both batch and stochastic gradient descent.

 <dc:description>  It remains a challenging problem to tightly estimate the worst case response
time of an application in a distributed embedded system, especially when there
are dependencies between tasks. We discovered that the state-of-the art
techniques considering task dependencies either fail to obtain a conservative
bound or produce a loose upper bound. We propose a novel conservative
performance analysis, called hybrid performance analysis, combining the
response time analysis technique and the scheduling time bound analysis
technique to compute a tighter bound fast. Through extensive experiments with
randomly generated graphs, superior performance of our proposed approach
compared with previous methods is confirmed.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an end-to-end framework, namely fully convolutional
recurrent network (FCRN) for handwritten Chinese text recognition (HCTR).
Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on segmentation, our FCRN is
trained with online text data directly and learns to associate the pen-tip
trajectory with a sequence of characters. FCRN consists of four parts: a
path-signature layer to extract signature features from the input pen-tip
trajectory, a fully convolutional network to learn informative representation,
a sequence modeling layer to make per-frame predictions on the input sequence
and a transcription layer to translate the predictions into a label sequence.
The FCRN is end-to-end trainable in contrast to conventional methods whose
components are separately trained and tuned. We also present a refined beam
search method that efficiently integrates the language model to decode the FCRN
and significantly improve the recognition results.
  We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the test sets from the
databases CASIA-OLHWDB and ICDAR 2013 Chinese handwriting recognition
competition, and both achieve state-of-the-art performance with correct rates
of 96.40% and 95.00%, respectively.

 <dc:description>  The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model with continuous
latent variables where a pair of probabilistic encoder (bottom-up) and decoder
(top-down) is jointly learned by stochastic gradient variational Bayes. We
first elaborate Gaussian VAE, approximating the local covariance matrix of the
decoder as an outer product of the principal direction at a position determined
by a sample drawn from Gaussian distribution. We show that this model, referred
to as VAE-ROC, better captures the data manifold, compared to the standard
Gaussian VAE where independent multivariate Gaussian was used to model the
decoder. Then we extend the VAE-ROC to handle mixed categorical and continuous
data. To this end, we employ Gaussian copula to model the local dependency in
mixed categorical and continuous data, leading to {\em Gaussian copula
variational autoencoder} (GCVAE). As in VAE-ROC, we use the rank-one
approximation for the covariance in the Gaussian copula, to capture the local
dependency structure in the mixed data. Experiments on various datasets
demonstrate the useful behaviour of VAE-ROC and GCVAE, compared to the standard
VAE.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the role of a relay in multiple access channels (MACs) with
bursty user traffic, where intermittent data traffic restricts the users to
bursty transmissions. As our main result, we characterize the degrees of
freedom (DoF) region of a $K$-user bursty multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
Gaussian MAC with a relay, where Bernoulli random states are introduced to
govern bursty user transmissions. To that end, we extend the noisy network
coding scheme to achieve the cut-set bound. Our main contribution is in
exploring the role of a relay from various perspectives. First, we show that a
relay can provide a DoF gain in bursty channels, unlike in conventional
non-bursty channels. Interestingly, we find that the relaying gain can scale
with additional antennas at the relay to some extent. Moreover, observing that
a relay can help achieve collision-free performances, we establish the
necessary and sufficient condition for attaining collision-free DoF. Lastly, we
consider scenarios in which some physical perturbation shared around the users
may generate data traffic simultaneously, causing transmission patterns across
them to be correlated. We demonstrate that for most cases in such scenarios,
the relaying gain is greater when the users' transmission patterns are more
correlated, hence when more severe collisions take place. Our results have
practical implications in various scenarios of wireless networks such as
device-to-device systems and random media access control protocols.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO used for access and backhaul in
ultra-dense network (UDN) has been considered as the promising 5G technique. We
consider such an heterogeneous network (HetNet) that ultra-dense small base
stations (BSs) exploit mmWave massive MIMO for access and backhaul, while
macrocell BS provides the control service with low frequency band. However, the
channel estimation for mmWave massive MIMO can be challenging, since the pilot
overhead to acquire the channels associated with a large number of antennas in
mmWave massive MIMO can be prohibitively high. This paper proposes a structured
compressive sensing (SCS)-based channel estimation scheme, where the angular
sparsity of mmWave channels is exploited to reduce the required pilot overhead.
Specifically, since the path loss for non-line-of-sight paths is much larger
than that for line-of-sight paths, the mmWave massive channels in the angular
domain appear the obvious sparsity. By exploiting such sparsity, the required
pilot overhead only depends on the small number of dominated multipath.
Moreover, the sparsity within the system bandwidth is almost unchanged, which
can be exploited for the further improved performance. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms its counterpart, and it can
approach the performance bound.

 <dc:description>  The paper suggests a frequency criterion of error-free recoverability of a
missing value for sequences, i.e., discrete time processes, in a pathwise
setting, without using probabilistic assumptions on the ensemble. This setting
targets situations where we deal with a sole sequence that is deemed to be
unique and such that we cannot rely on statistics collected from other similar
samples. A missing value has to be recovered using the intrinsic properties of
this sole sequence. In the paper, error-free recoverability is established for
classes of sequences with Z-transform vanishing at a point with a rate that can
be chosen arbitrarily. The corresponding recovering kernels are obtained
explicitly. Some robustness with respect to noise contamination is established
for the suggested recovering algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In practical mobile communication engineering applications, surfaces of
antenna array deployment regions are usually uneven. Therefore, massive
multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) communication systems usually transmit wireless
signals by irregular antenna arrays. To evaluate the performance of irregular
antenna arrays, the matrix correlation coefficient and ergodic received gain
are defined for massive MIMO communication systems with mutual coupling
effects. Furthermore, the lower bound of the ergodic achievable rate, symbol
error rate (SER) and average outage probability are firstly derived for
multi-user massive MIMO communication systems using irregular antenna arrays.
Asymptotic results are also derived when the number of antennas approaches
infinity. Numerical results indicate that there exists a maximum achievable
rate when the number of antennas keeps increasing in massive MIMO communication
systems using irregular antenna arrays. Moreover, the irregular antenna array
outperforms the regular antenna array in the achievable rate of massive MIMO
communication systems when the number of antennas is larger than or equal to a
given threshold.

 <dc:description>  Human beings often assess the aesthetic quality of an image coupled with the
identification of the image's semantic content. This paper addresses the
correlation issue between automatic aesthetic quality assessment and semantic
recognition. We cast the assessment problem as the main task among a multi-task
deep model, and argue that semantic recognition task offers the key to address
this problem. Based on convolutional neural networks, we employ a single and
simple multi-task framework to efficiently utilize the supervision of aesthetic
and semantic labels. A correlation item between these two tasks is further
introduced to the framework by incorporating the inter-task relationship
learning. This item not only provides some useful insight about the correlation
but also improves assessment accuracy of the aesthetic task. Particularly, an
effective strategy is developed to keep a balance between the two tasks, which
facilitates to optimize the parameters of the framework. Extensive experiments
on the challenging AVA dataset and Photo.net dataset validate the importance of
semantic recognition in aesthetic quality assessment, and demonstrate that
multi-task deep models can discover an effective aesthetic representation to
achieve state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:title>Routing and Sorting Via Matchings On Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Banerjee, Indranil</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Richards, Dana</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The paper is divided in to two parts. In the first part we present some new
results for the \textit{routing via matching} model introduced by Alon et
al\cite{5}. This model can be viewed as a communication scheme on a distributed
network. The nodes in the network can communicate via matchings (a step), where
a node exchanges data with its partner. Formally, given a connected graph $G$
with vertices labeled from $[1,...,n]$ and a permutation $\pi$ giving the
destination of pebbles on the vertices the problem is to find a minimum step
routing scheme. This is denoted as the routing time $rt(G,\pi)$ of $G$ given
$\pi$. In this paper we present the following new results, which answer one of
the open problems posed in \cite{5}: 1) Determining whether $rt(G,\pi)$ is $\le
2$ can be done in $O(n^{2.5})$ deterministic time for any arbitrary connected
graph $G$. 2) Determining whether $rt(G,\pi)$ is $\le k$ for any $k \ge 3$ is
NP-Complete. In the second part we study a related property of graphs, which
measures how easy it is to design sorting networks using only the edges of a
given graph. Informally, \textit{sorting number} of a graph is the minimum
depth sorting network that only uses edges of the graph. Many of the classical
results on sorting networks can be represented in this framework. We show that
a tree with maximum degree $\Delta$ can accommodate a $O(\min(n\Delta^2,n^2))$
depth sorting network. Additionally, we give two instance of trees for which
this bound is tight.

 <dc:description>  In quantitative information flow we say that program $Q$ is &quot;at least as
secure as&quot; $P$ just when the amount of secret information flowing from $Q$ is
never more than flows from $P$, with of course a suitable quantification of
&quot;flow&quot;. This secure-refinement order $\sqsubseteq$ is compositional just when
$P{\sqsubseteq}Q$ implies ${\cal C}(P){\sqsubseteq}{\cal C}(Q)$ for any context
${\cal C}$, again with a suitable definition of &quot;context&quot;.
  Remarkable however is that leaks caused by executing $P,Q$ might not be
limited to their declared variables: they might impact correlated secrets in
variables declared and initialised in some broader context to which $P,Q$ do
not refer even implicitly. We call such leaks collateral because their effect
is felt in domains of which (the programmers of) $P, Q$ might be wholly
unaware: our inspiration is the &quot;Dalenius&quot; phenomenon for statistical
databases.
  We show that a proper treatment of these collateral leaks is necessary for a
compositional program semantics for read/write &quot;open&quot; programs. By adapting a
recent Hidden-Markov denotational model for non-interference security, so that
it becomes &quot;collateral aware&quot;, we give techniques and examples (e.g.\
public-key encryption) to show how collateral leakage can be calculated and
then bounded in its severity.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel reversible data hiding (RDH) algorithm for
gray-scaled images, in which the prediction-error of prediction error (PPE) of
a pixel is used to carry the secret data. In the proposed method, the pixels to
be embedded are firstly predicted with their neighboring pixels to obtain the
corresponding prediction errors (PEs). Then, by exploiting the PEs of the
neighboring pixels, the prediction of the PEs of the pixels can be determined.
And, a sorting technique based on the local complexity of a pixel is used to
collect the PPEs to generate an ordered PPE sequence so that, smaller PPEs will
be processed first for data embedding. By reversibly shifting the PPE histogram
(PPEH) with optimized parameters, the pixels corresponding to the altered PPEH
bins can be finally modified to carry the secret data. Experimental results
have implied that the proposed method can benefit from the prediction procedure
of the PEs, sorting technique as well as parameters selection, and therefore
outperform some state-of-the-art works in terms of payload-distortion
performance when applied to different images.

 <dc:title>Time-Frequency analysis via the Fourier Representation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Singh, Pushpendra</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The nonstationary nature of signals and nonlinear systems require the
time-frequency representation. In time-domain signal, frequency information is
derived from the phase of the Gabor's analytic signal which is practically
obtained by the inverse Fourier transform. This study presents time-frequency
analysis by the Fourier transform which maps the time-domain signal into the
frequency-domain. In this study, we derive the time information from the phase
of the frequency-domain signal and obtain the time-frequency representation. In
order to obtain the time information in Fourier domain, we define the concept
of `frequentaneous time' which is frequency derivative of phase. This is very
similar to the group delay, which is also defined as frequency derivative of
phase and it provide physical meaning only when it is positive. The
frequentaneous time is always positive or negative depending upon whether
signal is defined for only positive or negative times, respectively. If a
signal is defined for both positive and negative times, then we divide the
signal into two parts, signal for positive times and signal for negative times.
The proposed frequentaneous time and Fourier transform based time-frequency
distribution contains only those frequencies which are present in the Fourier
spectrum. Simulations and numerical results, on many simulated as well as read
data, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for the time-frequency
analysis of a signal.

 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional neural network models pre-trained for the ImageNet
classification task have been successfully adopted to tasks in other domains,
such as texture description and object proposal generation, but these tasks
require annotations for images in the new domain. In this paper, we focus on a
novel and challenging task in the pure unsupervised setting: fine-grained image
retrieval. Even with image labels, fine-grained images are difficult to
classify, let alone the unsupervised retrieval task. We propose the Selective
Convolutional Descriptor Aggregation (SCDA) method. SCDA firstly localizes the
main object in fine-grained images, a step that discards the noisy background
and keeps useful deep descriptors. The selected descriptors are then aggregated
and dimensionality reduced into a short feature vector using the best practices
we found. SCDA is unsupervised, using no image label or bounding box
annotation. Experiments on six fine-grained datasets confirm the effectiveness
of SCDA for fine-grained image retrieval. Besides, visualization of the SCDA
features shows that they correspond to visual attributes (even subtle ones),
which might explain SCDA's high mean average precision in fine-grained
retrieval. Moreover, on general image retrieval datasets, SCDA achieves
comparable retrieval results with state-of-the-art general image retrieval
approaches.

hardware from multiple hardware generations and vendors. We evaluate the
predictive power of the model on a broad array of computational kernels
relevant to scientific computing. In terms of the geometric mean, our simple,
vendor- and GPU-type-independent model achieves relative accuracy comparable to
that of previously published work using hardware specific models.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Proportionate-type normalized suband adaptive filter (PNSAF-type) algorithms
are very attractive choices for echo cancellation. To further obtain both fast
convergence rate and low steady-state error, in this paper, a variable step
size (VSS) version of the presented improved PNSAF (IPNSAF) algorithm is
proposed by minimizing the square of the noise-free a posterior subband error
signals. A noniterative shrinkage method is used to recover the noise-free a
priori subband error signals from the noisy subband error signals.
Significantly, the proposed VSS strategy can be applied to any other PNSAF-type
algorithm, since it is independent of the proportionate principles. Simulation
results in the context of acoustic echo cancellation have demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Semantic labeling of RGB-D scenes is crucial to many intelligent applications
including perceptual robotics. It generates pixelwise and fine-grained label
maps from simultaneously sensed photometric (RGB) and depth channels. This
paper addresses this problem by i) developing a novel Long Short-Term Memorized
Context Fusion (LSTM-CF) Model that captures and fuses contextual information
from multiple channels of photometric and depth data, and ii) incorporating
this model into deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for end-to-end
training. Specifically, contexts in photometric and depth channels are,
respectively, captured by stacking several convolutional layers and a long
short-term memory layer; the memory layer encodes both short-range and
long-range spatial dependencies in an image along the vertical direction.
Another long short-term memorized fusion layer is set up to integrate the
contexts along the vertical direction from different channels, and perform
bi-directional propagation of the fused vertical contexts along the horizontal
direction to obtain true 2D global contexts. At last, the fused contextual
representation is concatenated with the convolutional features extracted from
the photometric channels in order to improve the accuracy of fine-scale
semantic labeling. Our proposed model has set a new state of the art, i.e.,
48.1% and 49.4% average class accuracy over 37 categories (2.2% and 5.4%
improvement) on the large-scale SUNRGBD dataset and the NYUDv2dataset,
respectively.

 <dc:title>Fronthaul Compression and Transmit Beamforming Optimization for
  Multi-Antenna Uplink C-RAN</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhou, Yuhan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Yu, Wei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers the joint fronthaul compression and transmit beamforming
design for the uplink cloud radio access network (C-RAN), in which
multi-antenna user terminals communicate with a cloud-computing based
centralized processor (CP) through multi-antenna base-stations (BSs) serving as
relay nodes. A compress-and-forward relaying strategy, named the VMAC scheme,
is employed, in which the BSs can either perform single-user compression or
Wyner-Ziv coding to quantize the received signals and send the quantization
bits to the CP via capacity-limited fronthaul links; the CP performs successive
decoding with either successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver or
linear minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) receiver. Under this setup, this paper
investigates the joint optimization of the transmit beamformers at the users
and the quantization noise covariance matrices at the BSs for maximizing the
network utility. A novel weighted minimum-mean-square-error successive convex
approximation (WMMSE-SCA) algorithm is first proposed for maximizing the
weighted sum rate under the user transmit power and fronthaul capacity
constraints with single-user compression. Assuming a heuristic decompression
order, the proposed algorithm is then adapted for optimizing the transmit
beamforming and fronthaul compression under Wyner-Ziv coding. This paper also
proposes a low-complexity separate design consisting of optimizing transmit
beamformers for the Gaussian vector multiple-access channel along with
per-antenna quantizers with uniform quantization noise levels across the
antennas at each BS. Numerical results show that with optimized beamforming and
fronthaul compression, C-RAN can significantly outperform conventional cellular
networks. Furthermore, the low complexity separate design already performs very
close to the optimized joint design in regime of practical interest.

 <dc:description>  Despite the advancements in search engine features, ranking methods,
technologies, and the availability of programmable APIs, current-day
open-access digital libraries still rely on crawl-based approaches for
acquiring their underlying document collections. In this paper, we propose a
novel search-driven framework for acquiring documents for scientific portals.
Within our framework, publicly-available research paper titles and author names
are used as queries to a Web search engine. Next, research papers and sources
of research papers are identified from the search results using accurate
classification modules. Our experiments highlight not only the performance of
our individual classifiers but also the effectiveness of our overall
Search/Crawl framework. Indeed, we were able to obtain approximately 0.665
million research documents through our fully-automated framework using about
0.076 million queries. These prolific results position Web search as an
effective alternative to crawl methods for acquiring both the actual documents
and seed URLs for future crawls.

 <dc:description>  Existential rules, also known as data dependencies in Databases, have been
recently rediscovered as a promising family of languages for Ontology-based
Query Answering. In this paper, we prove that disjunctive embedded dependencies
exactly capture the class of recursively enumerable ontologies in
Ontology-based Conjunctive Query Answering (OCQA). Our expressive completeness
result does not rely on any built-in linear order on the database. To establish
the expressive completeness, we introduce a novel semantic definition for OCQA
ontologies. We also show that neither the class of disjunctive tuple-generating
dependencies nor the class of embedded dependencies is expressively complete
for recursively enumerable OCQA ontologies.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Volatility in stock markets has been extensively studied in the applied
finance literature. In this paper, Artificial Neural Network models based on
various back propagation algorithms have been constructed to predict volatility
in the Indian stock market through volatility of NIFTY returns and volatility
of gold returns. This model considers India VIX, CBOE VIX, volatility of crude
oil returns (CRUDESDR), volatility of DJIA returns (DJIASDR), volatility of DAX
returns (DAXSDR), volatility of Hang Seng returns (HANGSDR) and volatility of
Nikkei returns (NIKKEISDR) as predictor variables. Three sets of experiments
have been performed over three time periods to judge the effectiveness of the
approach.

 <dc:title>Using Clustering Method to Understand Indian Stock Market Volatility</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chaudhuri, Tamal Datta</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ghosh, Indranil</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we use Clustering Method to understand whether stock market
volatility can be predicted at all, and if so, when it can be predicted. The
exercise has been performed for the Indian stock market on daily data for two
years. For our analysis we map number of clusters against number of variables.
We then test for efficiency of clustering. Our contention is that, given a
fixed number of variables, one of them being historic volatility of NIFTY
returns, if increase in the number of clusters improves clustering efficiency,
then volatility cannot be predicted. Volatility then becomes random as, for a
given time period, it gets classified in various clusters. On the other hand,
if efficiency falls with increase in the number of clusters, then volatility
can be predicted as there is some homogeneity in the data. If we fix the number
of clusters and then increase the number of variables, this should have some
impact on clustering efficiency. Indeed if we can hit upon, in a sense, an
optimum number of variables, then if the number of clusters is reasonably
small, we can use these variables to predict volatility. The variables that we
consider for our study are volatility of NIFTY returns, volatility of gold
returns, India VIX, CBOE VIX, volatility of crude oil returns, volatility of
DJIA returns, volatility of DAX returns, volatility of Hang Seng returns and
volatility of Nikkei returns. We use three clustering algorithms namely Kernel
K-Means, Self Organizing Maps and Mixture of Gaussian models and two internal
clustering validity measures, Silhouette Index and Dunn Index, to assess the
quality of generated clusters.

 <dc:title>Effective inter-symbol interference mitigation with a limited amount of

 <dc:description>  In molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD), the inter-symbol
interference (ISI) is a well known severe problem that deteriorates both data
rates and link reliability. ISI mainly occurs due to the slow and highly random
propagation of the messenger molecules, which causes the emitted molecules from
the previous symbols to interfere with molecules from the current symbol. An
effective way to mitigate the ISI is using enzymes to degrade undesired
molecules. Prior work on ISI mitigation by enzymes has assumed an infinite
amount of enzymes randomly distributed around the molecular channel. Taking a
different approach, this paper assumes an MCvD channel with a limited amount of
enzymes. The main question this paper addresses is how to deploy these enzymes
in an effective structure so that ISI mitigation is maximized. To find an
effective MCvD channel environment, this study considers optimization of the
shape of the transmitter node, the deployment location and structure, the size
of the enzyme deployed area, and the half-lives of the enzymes. It also
analyzes the dependence of the optimum size of the enzyme area on the distance
and half-life.

 <dc:title>Quantum Geo-Encryption</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work we introduce the concept of quantum geo-encryption - a protocol
that invokes direct quantum encryption of messages coupled to quantum location
monitoring of the intended receiver. By obfuscating the quantum information
required by both the decrypting process and the location verification process,
a communication channel is created in which the encrypted data can only be
decrypted at a specific geographic locale. Classical wireless communications
can be invoked to unlock the quantum encryption process thereby allowing for
any deployment scenario regardless of the channel conditions. Quantum
geo-encryption can also be used to realize quantum-computing instructions that
can only be implemented at a specific location, and allow for a specified
geographical data-route through a distributed network. Here we consider the
operational aspects of quantum geo-encryption in generic Rician channels,
demonstrating that the likelihood of a successful spoofing attack approaches
zero as the adversary moves away from the allowed decrypting location. The work
introduced here resolves a long-standing quest to directly deliver information
which can only be decrypted at a given location free of assumptions on the
physical security of a receiver.

 <dc:title>Impact of Knowledge on Election Time in Anonymous Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dieudonn&#xe9;, Yoann</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Pelc, Andrzej</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Leader election is one of the basic problems in distributed computing. For
anonymous networks, the task of leader election is formulated as follows: every
node v of the network must output a simple path, which is coded as a sequence
of port numbers, such that all these paths end at a common node, the leader. In
this paper, we study deterministic leader election in arbitrary anonymous
networks. It is well known that leader election is impossible in some networks,
regardless of the allocated amount of time, even if nodes know the map of the
network. However, even in networks in which it is possible to elect a leader
knowing the map, the task may be still impossible without any knowledge,
regardless of the allocated time. On the other hand, for any network in which
leader election is possible knowing the map, there is a minimum time, called
the election index, in which this can be done. Informally, the election index
of a network is the minimum depth at which views of all nodes are distinct. Our
aim is to establish tradeoffs between the allocated time $\tau$ and the amount
of information that has to be given a priori to the nodes to enable leader
election in time $\tau$ in all networks for which leader election in this time
is at all possible. Following the framework of algorithms with advice, this
information is provided to all nodes at the start by an oracle knowing the
entire network. The length of this string (its number of bits) is called the
size of advice. For a given time $\tau$ allocated to leader election, we give
upper and lower bounds on the minimum size of advice sufficient to perform
leader election in time $\tau$. We focus on the two sides of the time spectrum
and give tight (or almost tight) bounds on the minimum size of advice for these
extremes. We also show that constant advice is not sufficient for leader
election in all graphs, regardless of the allocated time.

 <dc:title>Empirical study of PROXTONE and PROXTONE$^+$ for Fast Learning of Large
  Scale Sparse Models</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  PROXTONE is a novel and fast method for optimization of large scale
non-smooth convex problem \cite{shi2015large}. In this work, we try to use
PROXTONE method in solving large scale \emph{non-smooth non-convex} problems,
for example training of sparse deep neural network (sparse DNN) or sparse
convolutional neural network (sparse CNN) for embedded or mobile device.
PROXTONE converges much faster than first order methods, while first order
method is easy in deriving and controlling the sparseness of the solutions.
Thus in some applications, in order to train sparse models fast, we propose to
combine the merits of both methods, that is we use PROXTONE in the first
several epochs to reach the neighborhood of an optimal solution, and then use
the first order method to explore the possibility of sparsity in the following
training. We call such method PROXTONE plus (PROXTONE$^+$). Both PROXTONE and
PROXTONE$^+$ are tested in our experiments, and which demonstrate both methods
improved convergence speed twice as fast at least on diverse sparse model
learning problems, and at the same time reduce the size to 0.5\% for DNN
models. The source of all the algorithms is available upon request.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a class of mixed-effects models for joint modeling of
spatially correlated intensity variation and warping variation in 2D images.
Spatially correlated intensity variation and warp variation are modeled as
random effects, resulting in a nonlinear mixed-effects model that enables
simultaneous estimation of template and model parameters by optimization of the
likelihood function. We propose an algorithm for fitting the model which
alternates estimation of variance parameters and image registration. This
approach avoids the potential estimation bias in the template estimate that
arises when treating registration as a preprocessing step. We apply the model
to datasets of facial images and 2D brain magnetic resonance images to
illustrate the simultaneous estimation and prediction of intensity and warp
effects.

 <dc:title>Joint DOA and Frequency Estimation with Sub-Nyquist Sampling</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Liang</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Wei, Ping</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, to jointly estimate the frequency and the
direction-of-arrival(DOA) of the narrowband far-field signals, a novel array
receiver architecture is presented by the concept of the sub-Nyquist sampling
techniques. In particular, our contribution is threefold. i) First, we propose
a time-space union signal reception model for receiving array signals, where
the sub-Nyquist sampling techniques and arbitrary array geometries are employed
to decrease the time-domain sampling rate and improve the DOA estimation
accuracy. A better joint estimation is obtained in the higher time-space union
space. ii) Second, two joint estimation algorithms are proposed for the
receiving model. One is based on a trilinear decomposition from the third-order
tensor theory and the other is based on subspace decomposition. iii) Third, we
derive the corresponding Cram\'er\text{-}Rao Bound (CRB) for frequency and DOA
estimates. In the case of the branch number of our architecture is equal to the
reduction factor of the sampling rate, it is observed that the CRB is robust in
terms of the number of signals, while the CRB based on the Nyquist sampling
scheme will increase with respect to the number of signals. In addition, the
new steer vectors of the union time-space model are completely uncorrelated
under the limited number of sensors, which improves the estimation performance.
Furthermore, the simulation results demonstrate that our estimates via the
receiver architecture associated with the proposed algorithms closely match the
CRB according to the noise levels, the branch number and the source number as
well.

 <dc:description>  Secure compilation studies compilers that generate target-level components
that are as secure as their source-level counterparts. Full abstraction is the
most widely-proven property when defining a secure compiler. A compiler is
modular if it allows different components to be compiled independently and then
to be linked together to form a whole program. Unfortunately, many existing
fully-abstract compilers to untyped machine code are not modular. So, while
fully-abstractly compiled components are secure from malicious attackers, if
they are linked against each other the resulting component may become
vulnerable to attacks. This paper studies how to devise modular, fully-abstract
compilers. It first analyses the attacks arising when compiled programs are
linked together, identifying security threats that are due to linking. Then, it
defines a compiler from an object-based language with method calls and dynamic
memory allocation to untyped assembly language extended with a memory isolation
mechanism. The paper provides a proof sketch that the defined compiler is
fully-abstract and modular, so its output can be linked together without
introducing security violations.

 <dc:description>  We exhibit a new relationship between dynamic and static semantics. We define
the categorical outlay needed to define Interaction Graphs models, a
generalisation of Girard's Geometry of Interaction models, which strongly
relate to game semantics. We then show how this category is mapped to weighted
relational models of linear logic. This brings into vision a new bridge between
the dynamic and static approaches, and provides formal grounds for considering
interaction graphs models as quantitative versions of GoI and game semantics
models. We finally proceed to show how the interaction graphs models relate to
a very general notion of quantitative coherence spaces.

 <dc:description>  Data randomization or scrambling has been effectively used in various
applications to improve the data security. In this paper, we use the idea of
data randomization to proactively randomize the spectrum (re)allocation to
improve connections' security. As it is well-known that random (re)allocation
fragments the spectrum and thus increases blocking in elastic optical networks,
we analyze the tradeoff between system performance and security. To this end,
in addition to spectrum randomization, we utilize an on-demand defragmentation
scheme every time a request is blocked due to the spectrum fragmentation. We
model the occupancy pattern of an elastic optical link (EOL) using a
multi-class continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) under the random-fit spectrum
allocation method. Numerical results show that although both the blocking and
security can be improved for a particular so-called randomization process (RP)
arrival rate, while with the increase in RP arrival rate the connections'
security improves at the cost of the increase in overall blocking.

 <dc:description>  In time-domain synchronous OFDM (TDS-OFDM) system for digital television
terrestrial multimedia broadcasting (DTMB) standard, the baseband OFDM signal
is upsampled and shaping filtered by square root raised cosine (SRRC) filter
before digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Much of the work in the area of
timing synchronization for TDS-OFDM focuses on frame synchronization and
sampling clock frequency offset recovery, which does not consider the sampling
clock phase offset due to the upsampling and SRRC filter. This paper evaluates
the bit-error-rate (BER) effect of sampling clock phase offset in TDS-OFDM
system. First, we provide the BER for M-order quadrature amplitude modulation
(M-QAM) in uncoded TDS-OFDM system. Second, under the condition of the optimal
BER criterion and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, we propose a
near optimal sampling phase estimation criterion based on frequency-domain
response. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed criterion also has good
performance in actual TDS-OFDM system with channel coding over multipath
channels, and it is superior to the conventional symbol timing recovery methods
for TDS-OFDM system.

 <dc:description>  This work addresses the design of optimal linear transmit filters for the
Multiple Input-Multiple Output (MIMO) Broadcast Channel (BC) when several
spatial streams are allocated to each user.We also consider that the Channel
State Information (CSI) is perfect at the receivers but is only partial at the
transmitter. A statistical model for the partial CSI is assumed and exploited
for the filter design. Similarly to the single-stream per user case, the
problem is solved via Mean Square Error (MSE) dualities and interference
functions. However, including more streams per user involves an additional
complexity level since we must determine how to distribute the per-user rates
among the streams. Such problem is solved using a projected gradient algorithm.

 <dc:description>  As more and more data is transmitted in the configurable optical layer,
whereby all optical switches forward packets without electronic layers
involved, we envision privacy as the intrinsic property of future optical
networks. In this paper, we propose Optical Onion Routing (OOR) routing and
forwarding techniques, inspired by the onion routing in the Internet layer, the
best known realization of anonymous communication today, but designed with
specific features innate to optical networks. We propose to design the optical
anonymization network system with a new optical anonymization node
architecture, including the optical components and their electronic
counterparts to realize layered encryption. We propose modification to the
secret key generation using Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), able to
utilize different primitive irreducible polynomials, and the usage optical XOR
operation as encryption, an important optical technology coming of age. We
prove formally that, for the proposed encryption techniques and distribution of
secret information, the optical onion network is perfectly private and secure.
The paper aims at providing practical foundations for privacy-enhancing optical
network technologies.

 <dc:description>  The problem of finding the shortest path for a vehicle visiting a given
sequence of target points subject to the motion constraints of the vehicle is
an important problem that arises in several monitoring and surveillance
applications involving unmanned aerial vehicles. There is currently no
algorithm that can find an optimal solution to this problem. Therefore,
heuristics that can find approximate solutions with guarantees on the quality
of the solutions are useful. The best approximation algorithm currently
available for the case when the distance between any two adjacent target points
in the sequence is at least equal to twice the minimum radius of the vehicle
has a guarantee of 3.04. This article provides a new approximation algorithm
which improves this guarantee to 2.04. The developed algorithm is also
implemented for hundreds of typical instances involving at most 30 points to
corroborate the performance of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  We study the statistics of citations made to the indexed Science journals in
the Journal Citation Reports during the period 2004-2013 using different
measures. We consider different measures which quantify the impact of the
journals. To our surprise, we find that the apparently uncorrelated measures,
even when defined in an arbitrary manner, show strong correlations. This is
checked over all the years considered. Impact factor being one of these
measures, the present work raises the question whether it is actually a nearly
perfect index as claimed often. In addition we study the distributions of the
different indices which also behave similarly.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of automatically finding the parameters of a
statistical machine translation system that maximize BLEU scores while ensuring
that decoding speed exceeds a minimum value. We propose the use of Bayesian
Optimization to efficiently tune the speed-related decoding parameters by
easily incorporating speed as a noisy constraint function. The obtained
parameter values are guaranteed to satisfy the speed constraint with an
associated confidence margin. Across three language pairs and two speed
constraint values, we report overall optimization time reduction compared to
grid and random search. We also show that Bayesian Optimization can decouple
speed and BLEU measurements, resulting in a further reduction of overall
optimization time as speed is measured over a small subset of sentences.

 <dc:description>  We present results from a new approach to learning and plasticity in
neuromorphic hardware systems: to enable flexibility in implementable learning
mechanisms while keeping high efficiency associated with neuromorphic
implementations, we combine a general-purpose processor with full-custom analog
elements.
  This processor is operating in parallel with a fully parallel neuromorphic
system consisting of an array of synapses connected to analog, continuous time
neuron circuits. Novel analog correlation sensor circuits process spike events
for each synapse in parallel and in real-time.
  The processor uses this pre-processing to compute new weights possibly using
additional information following its program.
  Therefore, learning rules can be defined in software giving a large degree of
flexibility.
  Synapses realize correlation detection geared towards Spike-Timing Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) as central computational primitive in the analog domain.
  Operating at a speed-up factor of 1000 compared to biological time-scale, we
measure time-constants from tens to hundreds of micro-seconds.
  We analyze variability across multiple chips and demonstrate learning using a
multiplicative STDP rule.
  We conclude, that the presented approach will enable flexible and efficient
learning as a platform for neuroscientific research and technological
applications.

 <dc:description>  2048 is an engaging single-player, nondeterministic video puzzle game, which,
thanks to the simple rules and hard-to-master gameplay, has gained massive
popularity in recent years. As 2048 can be conveniently embedded into the
discrete-state Markov decision processes framework, we treat it as a testbed
for evaluating existing and new methods in reinforcement learning. With the aim
to develop a strong 2048 playing program, we employ temporal difference
learning with systematic n-tuple networks. We show that this basic method can
be significantly improved with temporal coherence learning, multi-stage
function approximator with weight promotion, carousel shaping, and redundant
encoding. In addition, we demonstrate how to take advantage of the
characteristics of the n-tuple network, to improve the algorithmic
effectiveness of the learning process by i) delaying the (decayed) update and
applying lock-free optimistic parallelism to effortlessly make advantage of
multiple CPU cores. This way, we were able to develop the best known 2048
playing program to date, which confirms the effectiveness of the introduced
methods for discrete-state Markov decision problems.

 <dc:title>Robust Draws in Balanced Knockout Tournaments</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Balanced knockout tournaments are ubiquitous in sports competitions and are
also used in decision-making and elections. The traditional computational
question, that asks to compute a draw (optimal draw) that maximizes the winning
probability for a distinguished player, has received a lot of attention.
Previous works consider the problem where the pairwise winning probabilities
are known precisely, while we study how robust is the winning probability with
respect to small errors in the pairwise winning probabilities. First, we
present several illuminating examples to establish: (a)~there exist
deterministic tournaments (where the pairwise winning probabilities are~0 or~1)
where one optimal draw is much more robust than the other; and (b)~in general,
there exist tournaments with slightly suboptimal draws that are more robust
than all the optimal draws. The above examples motivate the study of the
computational problem of robust draws that guarantee a specified winning
probability. Second, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for approximating
the robustness of a draw for sufficiently small errors in pairwise winning
probabilities, and obtain that the stated computational problem is NP-complete.
We also show that two natural cases of deterministic tournaments where the
optimal draw could be computed in polynomial time also admit polynomial-time
algorithms to compute robust optimal draws.

 <dc:description>  In this work we present a novel end-to-end framework for tracking and
classifying a robot's surroundings in complex, dynamic and only partially
observable real-world environments. The approach deploys a recurrent neural
network to filter an input stream of raw laser measurements in order to
directly infer object locations, along with their identity in both visible and
occluded areas. To achieve this we first train the network using unsupervised
Deep Tracking, a recently proposed theoretical framework for end-to-end space
occupancy prediction. We show that by learning to track on a large amount of
unsupervised data, the network creates a rich internal representation of its
environment which we in turn exploit through the principle of inductive
transfer of knowledge to perform the task of it's semantic classification. As a
result, we show that only a small amount of labelled data suffices to steer the
network towards mastering this additional task. Furthermore we propose a novel
recurrent neural network architecture specifically tailored to tracking and
semantic classification in real-world robotics applications. We demonstrate the
tracking and classification performance of the method on real-world data
collected at a busy road junction. Our evaluation shows that the proposed
end-to-end framework compares favourably to a state-of-the-art, model-free
tracking solution and that it outperforms a conventional one-shot training
scheme for semantic classification.

computationally expensive graphical models. We present a method that leverages
a fully convolutional network (FCN) to predict semantic labels, depth and an
instance-based encoding using each pixel's direction towards its corresponding
instance center. Subsequently, we apply low-level computer vision techniques to
generate state-of-the-art instance segmentation on the street scene datasets
KITTI and Cityscapes. Our approach outperforms existing works by a large margin
and can additionally predict absolute distances of individual instances from a
monocular image as well as a pixel-level semantic labeling.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with two main issues regarding the short polar codes: the
potential of FEC-assisted decoding and optimal code concatenation strategies
under various design scenarios. Code concatenation and FEC-assisted decoding
are presented systematically, assuming a packetized system. It is shown that
FEC-assisted decoding can improve frame error rate of successive cancellation
decoding arbitrarily, at the expense of some coding rate loss and decoding
complexity linearly increasing with the number of codewords in the frame. This
is compared with list decoding whose complexity grows linearly with the list
size as well as the number of codewords. Thereafter, the frame construction
procedure and decoding algorithm are developed in a realistic framework. Taking
into consideration the effective throughput of the transmission protocol, the
problem of optimal design of concatenated codes is formulated under polar code
length, frame length and target frame-success-rate constraints. Simulations are
performed assuming both additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading
channels. It is shown that the divide-concatenate strategy for long frames does
not lead to any considerable gain. It is also shown that the performance of
FEC-assisted decoding of frames is improved as the frame length increases while
the conventional successive cancellation decoding undergoes a dramatic
performance loss.

 <dc:title>On Directed Steiner Trees with Multiple Roots</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.2.2</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new Steiner-type problem for directed graphs named
\textsc{$q$-Root Steiner Tree}. Here one is given a directed graph $G=(V,A)$
and two subsets of its vertices, $R$ of size $q$ and $T$, and the task is to
find a minimum size subgraph of $G$ that contains a path from each vertex of
$R$ to each vertex of $T$. The special case of this problem with $q=1$ is the
well known \textsc{Directed Steiner Tree} problem, while the special case with
$T=R$ is the \textsc{Strongly Connected Steiner Subgraph} problem.
  We first show that the problem is W[1]-hard with respect to $|T|$ for any $q
\ge 2$. Then we restrict ourselves to instances with $R \subseteq T$.
Generalizing the methods of Feldman and Ruhl [SIAM J. Comput. 2006], we present
an algorithm for this restriction with running time $O(2^{2q+4|T|}\cdot
n^{2q+O(1)})$, i.e., this restriction is FPT with respect to $|T|$ for any
constant $q$. We further show that we can, without significantly affecting the
achievable running time, loosen the restriction to only requiring that in the
solution there are a vertex $v$ and a path from each vertex of $R$ to $v$ and
from $v$ to each vertex of~$T$.
  Finally, we use the methods of Chitnis et al. [SODA 2014] to show that the
restricted version can be solved in planar graphs in $O(2^{O(q \log q+|T|\log
q)}\cdot n^{O(\sqrt{q})})$ time.

 <dc:title>DiffFlow: Differentiating Short and Long Flows for Load Balancing in
  Data Center Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In current Data Center Networks (DCNs), Equal- Cost MultiPath (ECMP) is used
as the de-facto routing protocol. However, ECMP does not differentiate between
short and long flows, the two main categories of flows depending on their
duration (lifetime). This issue causes hot-spots in the network, affecting
negatively the Flow Completion Time (FCT) and the throughput, the two key
performance metrics in data center networks. Previous work on load balancing
proposed solutions such as splitting long flows into short flows, using
per-packet forwarding approaches, and isolating the paths of short and long
flows. We propose DiffFlow, a new load balancing solution which detects long
flows and forwards packets using Random Packet Spraying (RPS) with help of SDN,
whereas the flows with small duration are forwarded with ECMP by default. The
use of ECMP for short flows is reasonable, as it does not create the
out-of-order problem; at the same time, RPS for long flows can efficiently help
to load balancing the entire network, given that long flows represent most of
the traffic in DCNs. The results show that our DiffFlow solution outperforms
both the individual usage of either RPS or ECMP, while the overall throughput
achieved is maintained at the level comparable to RPS.

 <dc:description>  The equivalence of peeling decoding (PD) and Belief Propagation (BP) for
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes over the binary erasure channel is
analyzed. Modifying the scheduling for PD, it is shown that exactly the same
variable nodes (VNs) are resolved in every iteration than with BP. The decrease
of erased VNs during the decoding process is analyzed instead of resolvable
equations. This quantity can also be derived with density evolution, resulting
in a drastic decrease in complexity. Finally, a scaling law using this quantity
is established for spatially coupled LDPC codes.

 <dc:title>The maximum mutual information between the output of a binary symmetric
  channel and a Boolean function of its input</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sarbu, Septimia</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We prove the Courtade-Kumar conjecture, which states that the mutual
information between any Boolean function of an $n$-dimensional vector of
independent and identically distributed inputs to a memoryless binary symmetric
channel and the corresponding vector of outputs is upper-bounded by
$1-\operatorname{H}(p)$, where $\operatorname{H}(p)$ represents the binary
entropy function. That is, let $\mathbf{X}=[X_1...X_n]$ be a vector of
independent and identically distributed Bernoulli($1/2$) random variables,
which are the input to a memoryless binary symmetric channel, with the error
probability equal to $0 \leq p \leq 1/2$, and $\mathbf{Y}=[Y_1...Y_n]$ the
corresponding output. Let $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be an
$n$-dimensional Boolean function. Then,
$\operatorname{MI}(f(\mathbf{X}),\mathbf{Y}) \leq 1-\operatorname{H}(p)$. We
provide the proof for the most general case of the conjecture, that is for any
$n$-dimensional Boolean function $f$ and for any value of the error probability
of the binary symmetric channel, $0 \leq p \leq 1/2$. Our proof employs only
basic concepts from information theory, probability theory and transformations
of random variables and vectors.

 <dc:description>  There is a consensus that human and non-human subjects experience temporal
distortions in many stages of their perceptual and decision-making systems.
Similarly, intertemporal choice research has shown that decision-makers
undervalue future outcomes relative to immediate ones. Here we combine
techniques from information theory and artificial intelligence to show how both
temporal distortions and intertemporal choice preferences can be explained as a
consequence of the coding efficiency of sensorimotor representation. In
particular, the model implies that interactions that constrain future behavior
are perceived as being both longer in duration and more valuable. Furthermore,
using simulations of artificial agents, we investigate how memory constraints
enforce a renormalization of the perceived timescales. Our results show that
qualitatively different discount functions, such as exponential and hyperbolic
discounting, arise as a consequence of an agent's probabilistic model of the
world.

 <dc:description>  Learned confidence measures gain increasing importance for outlier removal
and quality improvement in stereo vision. However, acquiring the necessary
training data is typically a tedious and time consuming task that involves
manual interaction, active sensing devices and/or synthetic scenes. To overcome
this problem, we propose a new, flexible, and scalable way for generating
training data that only requires a set of stereo images as input. The key idea
of our approach is to use different view points for reasoning about
contradictions and consistencies between multiple depth maps generated with the
same stereo algorithm. This enables us to generate a huge amount of training
data in a fully automated manner. Among other experiments, we demonstrate the
potential of our approach by boosting the performance of three learned
confidence measures on the KITTI2012 dataset by simply training them on a vast
amount of automatically generated training data rather than a limited amount of
laser ground truth data.

 <dc:description>  Large-scale data is of crucial importance for learning semantic segmentation
models, but annotating per-pixel masks is a tedious and inefficient procedure.
We note that for the topic of interactive image segmentation, scribbles are
very widely used in academic research and commercial software, and are
recognized as one of the most user-friendly ways of interacting. In this paper,
we propose to use scribbles to annotate images, and develop an algorithm to
train convolutional networks for semantic segmentation supervised by scribbles.
Our algorithm is based on a graphical model that jointly propagates information
from scribbles to unmarked pixels and learns network parameters. We present
competitive object semantic segmentation results on the PASCAL VOC dataset by
using scribbles as annotations. Scribbles are also favored for annotating stuff
(e.g., water, sky, grass) that has no well-defined shape, and our method shows
excellent results on the PASCAL-CONTEXT dataset thanks to extra inexpensive
scribble annotations. Our scribble annotations on PASCAL VOC are available at

 <dc:description>  At millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies, beamforming and large antenna arrays
are an essential requirement to combat the high path loss for mmW
communication. Moreover, at these frequencies, very large bandwidths are
available to fulfill the data rate requirements of future wireless networks.
However, utilization of these large bandwidths and of large antenna arrays can
result in a high power consumption which is an even bigger concern for mmW
receiver design. In a mmW receiver, the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is
generally considered as the most power consuming block. In this paper,
primarily focusing on the ADC power, we analyze and compare the total power
consumption of the complete analog chain for Analog, Digital and Hybrid
beamforming (ABF, DBF and HBF) based receiver design. We show how power
consumption of these beamforming schemes varies with a change in the number of
antennas, the number of ADC bits (b) and the bandwidth (B). Moreover, we
compare low power (as in [1]) and high power (as in [2]) ADC models, and show
that for a certain range of number of antennas, b and B, DBF may actually have
a comparable and lower power consumption than ABF and HBF, respectively. In
addition, we also show how the choice of an appropriate beamforming scheme
depends on the signal-to-noise ratio regime.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new downlink non-orthogonal multiuser
superposition transmission scheme for future 5G cellular networks, which we
refer to as the lattice partition multiple access (LPMA). In this proposed
design, the base station transmits multilevel lattice codes for multiple users.
Each user's code level corresponds to a distinct prime and is weighted by a
product of all distinct primes of the other users excluding its own. Due to the
structural property of lattice codes, each user can cancel out the interference
from the other code levels by using the modulo lattice operation in a
successive/parallel manner. LPMA can overcome the drawback of non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA), which arises when users have similar channel
conditions. We demonstrate that the proposed LPMA shows a clear throughput
enhancement over the current NOMA scheme.

that can persistently oscillate with the actual values produced from each
pattern. With every firing event, a node also receives an on/off feedback
switch. If the node fires, then it sends a feedback result depending on the
input signal strength. If the input signal is positive or larger, it can store
an 'on' switch feedback for the next iteration. If the signal is negative or
smaller, it can store an 'off' switch feedback for the next iteration. If the
node does not fire, then it does not affect the current feedback situation and
receives the switch command produced by the last active pattern event for the
same neuron. The upper bound therefore also represents the largest or most
enclosing pattern set and the lower value is for the actual set of firing
patterns. If the pattern sequence repeats, it will oscillate between the two
values, allowing them to be recognised and measured more easily, over time.
Tests show that changing the sequence ordering produces different value sets,
which can also be measured.

 <dc:description>  This paper is devoted to the online dominating set problem and its variants
on trees, bipartite, bounded-degree, planar, and general graphs, distinguishing
between connected and not necessarily connected graphs. We believe this paper
represents the first systematic study of the effect of two limitations of
online algorithms: making irrevocable decisions while not knowing the future,
and being incremental, i.e., having to maintain solutions to all prefixes of
the input. This is quantified through competitive analyses of online algorithms
against two optimal algorithms, both knowing the entire input, but only one
having to be incremental. We also consider the competitive ratio of the weaker
of the two optimal algorithms against the other. In most cases, we obtain tight
bounds on the competitive ratios. Our results show that requiring the graphs to
be presented in a connected fashion allows the online algorithms to obtain
provably better solutions. Furthermore, we get detailed information regarding
the significance of the necessary requirement that online algorithms be
incremental. In some cases, having to be incremental fully accounts for the
online algorithm's disadvantage.

 <dc:description>  The precise design of a system may be considered a trade secret which should
be protected, whilst at the same time component manufacturers are sometimes
reluctant to release full test data (perhaps only providing mean time to
failure data). In this situation it seems impractical to both produce an
accurate reliability assessment and satisfy all parties' privacy requirements.
However, we present recent developments in cryptography which, when combined
with the recently developed survival signature in reliability theory, allows
almost total privacy to be maintained in a cryptographically strong manner in
precisely this setting. Thus, the system designer does not have to reveal their
trade secret design and the component manufacturer can retain component test
data in-house.

 <dc:title>Preference Elicitation For Single Crossing Domain</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Eliciting the preferences of a set of agents over a set of alternatives is a
problem of fundamental importance in social choice theory. Prior work on this
problem has studied the query complexity of preference elicitation for the
unrestricted domain and for the domain of single peaked preferences. In this
paper, we consider the domain of single crossing preference profiles and study
the query complexity of preference elicitation under various settings. We
consider two distinct situations: when an ordering of the voters with respect
to which the profile is single crossing is known versus when it is unknown. We
also consider different access models: when the votes can be accessed at
random, as opposed to when they are coming in a pre-defined sequence. In the
sequential access model, we distinguish two cases when the ordering is known:
the first is that sequence in which the votes appear is also a single-crossing
order, versus when it is not.
  The main contribution of our work is to provide polynomial time algorithms
with low query complexity for preference elicitation in all the above six
cases. Further, we show that the query complexities of our algorithms are
optimal up to constant factors for all but one of the above six cases. We then
present preference elicitation algorithms for profiles which are close to being
single crossing under various notions of closeness, for example, single
crossing width, minimum number of candidates | voters whose deletion makes a
profile single crossing.

 <dc:description>  This work is a further study on the Generalized Constraint Neural Network
(GCNN) model [1], [2]. Two challenges are encountered in the study, that is, to
embed any type of prior information and to select its imposing schemes. The
work focuses on the second challenge and studies a new constraint imposing
scheme for equality constraints. A new method called locally imposing function
(LIF) is proposed to provide a local correction to the GCNN prediction
function, which therefore falls within Locally Imposing Scheme (LIS). In
comparison, the conventional Lagrange multiplier method is considered as
Globally Imposing Scheme (GIS) because its added constraint term exhibits a
global impact to its objective function. Two advantages are gained from LIS
over GIS. First, LIS enables constraints to fire locally and explicitly in the
domain only where they need on the prediction function. Second, constraints can
be implemented within a network setting directly. We attempt to interpret
several constraint methods graphically from a viewpoint of the locality
principle. Numerical examples confirm the advantages of the proposed method. In
solving boundary value problems with Dirichlet and Neumann constraints, the
GCNN model with LIF is possible to achieve an exact satisfaction of the
constraints.

 <dc:description>  In this paper a unifying energy-based approach is provided to the modeling
and stability analysis of power systems coupled with market dynamics. We
consider a standard model of the power network with a third-order model for the
synchronous generators involving voltage dynamics. By applying the primal-dual
gradient method to a social welfare optimization, a distributed dynamic pricing
algorithm is obtained, which can be naturally formulated in port-Hamiltonian
form. By interconnection with the physical model a closed-loop port-Hamiltonian
system is obtained, whose properties are exploited to prove asymptotic
stability to the set of optimal points. This result is extended to the case
that also general nodal power constraints are included into the social welfare
problem. Additionally, the case of line congestion and power transmission costs
in acyclic networks is covered. Finally, a dynamic pricing algorithm is
proposed that does not require knowledge about the power supply and demand.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new two-grid approach based on Bellman-Kalaba quasilinearization
and Axelsson-Xu finite element two-grid method for the solution of singularly
perturbed reaction-diffusion equations. The algorithms involve solving one
inexpensive problem on coarse grid and solving on fine grid one linear problem
obtained by quasilinearization of the differential equation about an
interpolant of the computed solution on the coarse grid. Different meshes (of
Bakhvalov, Shishkin and Vulanovi\'c types) are examined. All the schemes are
uniformly convergent with respect to the small parameter. We show theoretically
and numerically that the global error of the two-grid method is the same as of
the nonlinear problem solved directly on the fine layer-adapted mesh.

 <dc:description>  Rectal tumour segmentation in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is a
challenging task, and an automated and consistent method would be highly
desirable to improve the modelling and prediction of patient outcomes from
tissue contrast enhancement characteristics - particularly in routine clinical
practice. A framework is developed to automate DCE-MRI tumour segmentation, by
introducing: perfusion-supervoxels to over-segment and classify DCE-MRI volumes
using the dynamic contrast enhancement characteristics; and the pieces-of-parts
graphical model, which adds global (anatomic) constraints that further refine
the supervoxel components that comprise the tumour. The framework was evaluated
on 23 DCE-MRI scans of patients with rectal adenocarcinomas, and achieved a
voxelwise area-under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.97
compared to expert delineations. Creating a binary tumour segmentation, 21 of
the 23 cases were segmented correctly with a median Dice similarity coefficient
(DSC) of 0.63, which is close to the inter-rater variability of this
challenging task. A sec- ond study is also included to demonstrate the method's
generalisability and achieved a DSC of 0.71. The framework achieves promising
results for the underexplored area of rectal tumour segmentation in DCE-MRI,
and the methods have potential to be applied to other DCE-MRI and supervoxel
segmentation problems

 <dc:description>  Cardiovascular monitoring is important to prevent diseases from progressing.
The jugular venous pulse (JVP) waveform offers important clinical information
about cardiac health, but is not routinely examined due to its invasive
catheterisation procedure. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the JVP
can be consistently observed in a non-contact manner using a novel light-based
photoplethysmographic imaging system, coded hemodynamic imaging (CHI). While
traditional monitoring methods measure the JVP at a single location, CHI's
wide-field imaging capabilities were able to observe the jugular venous pulse's
spatial flow profile for the first time. The important inflection points in the
JVP were observed, meaning that cardiac abnormalities can be assessed through
JVP distortions. CHI provides a new way to assess cardiac health through
non-contact light-based JVP monitoring, and can be used in non-surgical
environments for cardiac assessment.

 <dc:title>Annotation Order Matters: Recurrent Image Annotator for Arbitrary Length

 <dc:description>  Automatic image annotation has been an important research topic in
facilitating large scale image management and retrieval. Existing methods focus
on learning image-tag correlation or correlation between tags to improve
annotation accuracy. However, most of these methods evaluate their performance
using top-k retrieval performance, where k is fixed. Although such setting
gives convenience for comparing different methods, it is not the natural way
that humans annotate images. The number of annotated tags should depend on
image contents. Inspired by the recent progress in machine translation and
image captioning, we propose a novel Recurrent Image Annotator (RIA) model that
forms image annotation task as a sequence generation problem so that RIA can
natively predict the proper length of tags according to image contents. We
evaluate the proposed model on various image annotation datasets. In addition
to comparing our model with existing methods using the conventional top-k
evaluation measures, we also provide our model as a high quality baseline for
the arbitrary length image tagging task. Moreover, the results of our
experiments show that the order of tags in training phase has a great impact on
the final annotation performance.

 <dc:description>  Object recognition in images involves identifying objects with partial
occlusions, viewpoint changes, varying illumination, cluttered backgrounds.
Recent work in object recognition uses machine learning techniques SVM-KNN,
Local Ensemble Kernel Learning, Multiple Kernel Learning. In this paper, we
want to utilize SVM as week learners in AdaBoost. Experiments are done with
classifiers like near- est neighbor, k-nearest neighbor, Support vector
machines, Local learning(SVM- KNN) and AdaBoost. Models use Scale-Invariant
descriptors and Pyramid his- togram of gradient descriptors. AdaBoost is
trained with set of week classifier as SVMs, each with kernel distance function
on different descriptors. Results shows AdaBoost with SVM outperform other
methods for Object Categorization dataset.

objective is to design strategyproof mechanisms which are competitive against
the most efficient (but not strategyproof) mechanism.
  For the case with two items:
  (1) We provide a set of sufficient conditions for strategyproofness.
  (2) We use an analytic approach to derive strategyproof mechanisms which are
more competitive than all prior strategyproof mechanisms.
  (3) We improve the linear-program-based proof of Guo and Conitzer to show new
upper bounds on competitive ratios.
  (4) We provide the first &quot;mathematical&quot; upper bound proof.
  For the cases with any number of items:
  (1) We build on the Partial Allocation mechanisms introduced by Cole et al.
to design a strategyproof mechanism which is 0.67776-competitive, breaking the
2/3 barrier.
  (2) We propose a new subclass of strategyproof mechanisms called
Dynamical-Increasing-Price mechanisms, where each agent purchases the items
using virtual money, and the prices of the items depend on other agents'
preferences.

 <dc:description>  We unveil the existence of a vulnerability in Wi-Fi, which allows an
adversary to remotely launch a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack that propagates
both in time and space. This vulnerability stems from a coupling effect induced
by hidden nodes. Cascading DoS attacks can congest an entire network and do not
require the adversary to violate any protocol. We demonstrate the feasibility
of such attacks through experiments with real Wi-Fi cards, extensive ns-3
simulations, and theoretical analysis. The simulations show that the attack is
effective both in networks operating under fixed and varying bit rates, as well
as ad hoc and infrastructure modes. To gain insight into the root-causes of the
attack, we model the network as a dynamical system and analyze its limiting
behavior. The model predicts that a phase transition (and hence a cascading
attack) is possible when the retry limit parameter of Wi-Fi is greater or equal
to 7, and explicitly characterizes the phase transition region in terms of the
system parameters.

 <dc:title>Check-hybrid GLDPC Codes: Systematic Elimination of Trapping Sets and

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new approach to construct a class of check-hybrid
generalized low-density parity-check (CH-GLDPC) codes which are free of small
trapping sets. The approach is based on converting some selected check nodes
involving a trapping set into super checks corresponding to a 2-error
correcting component code. Specifically, we follow two main purposes to
construct the check-hybrid codes; first, based on the knowledge of the trapping
sets of the global LDPC code, single parity checks are replaced by super checks
to disable the trapping sets. We show that by converting specified single check
nodes, denoted as critical checks, to super checks in a trapping set, the
parallel bit flipping (PBF) decoder corrects the errors on a trapping set and
hence eliminates the trapping set. The second purpose is to minimize the rate
loss caused by replacing the super checks through finding the minimum number of
such critical checks. We also present an algorithm to find critical checks in a
trapping set of column-weight 3 LDPC code and then provide upper bounds on the
minimum number of such critical checks such that the decoder corrects all error
patterns on elementary trapping sets. Moreover, we provide a fixed set for a
class of constructed check-hybrid codes. The guaranteed error correction
capability of the CH-GLDPC codes is also studied. We show that a CH-GLDPC code
in which each variable node is connected to 2 super checks corresponding to a
2-error correcting component code corrects up to 5 errors. The results are also
extended to column-weight 4 LDPC codes. Finally, we investigate the eliminating
of trapping sets of a column-weight 3 LDPC code using the Gallager B decoding
algorithm and generalize the results obtained for the PBF for the Gallager B
decoding algorithm.

 <dc:title>Risk-Averse Multi-Armed Bandit Problems under Mean-Variance Measure</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The multi-armed bandit problems have been studied mainly under the measure of
expected total reward accrued over a horizon of length $T$. In this paper, we
address the issue of risk in multi-armed bandit problems and develop parallel
results under the measure of mean-variance, a commonly adopted risk measure in
economics and mathematical finance. We show that the model-specific regret and
the model-independent regret in terms of the mean-variance of the reward
process are lower bounded by $\Omega(\log T)$ and $\Omega(T^{2/3})$,
respectively. We then show that variations of the UCB policy and the DSEE
policy developed for the classic risk-neutral MAB achieve these lower bounds.

 <dc:description>  Gaussian process models are flexible, Bayesian non-parametric approaches to
regression. Properties of multivariate Gaussians mean that they can be combined
linearly in the manner of additive models and via a link function (like in
generalized linear models) to handle non-Gaussian data. However, the link
function formalism is restrictive, link functions are always invertible and
must convert a parameter of interest to a linear combination of the underlying
processes. There are many likelihoods and models where a non-linear combination
is more appropriate. We term these more general models Chained Gaussian
Processes: the transformation of the GPs to the likelihood parameters will not
generally be invertible, and that implies that linearisation would only be
possible with multiple (localized) links, i.e. a chain. We develop an
approximate inference procedure for Chained GPs that is scalable and applicable
to any factorized likelihood. We demonstrate the approximation on a range of
likelihood functions.

 <dc:title>Complexity Dichotomies for Unweighted Scoring Rules</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Scoring systems are an extremely important class of election systems. We
study the complexity of manipulation, constructive control by deleting voters
(CCDV), and bribery for scoring systems.
  For manipulation, we show that for all scoring rules with a constant number
of different coefficients, manipulation is in P. And we conjecture that there
is no dichotomy theorem.
  On the other hand, we obtain dichotomy theorems for CCDV and bribery problem.
More precisely, we show that both of these problems are easy for 1-approval,
2-approval, 1-veto, 2-veto, 3-veto, generalized 2-veto, and (2,1,...,1,0), and
hard in all other cases. These results are the &quot;dual&quot; of the dichotomy theorem
for the constructive control by adding voters (CCAV) problem from
(Hemaspaandra, Hemaspaandra, Schnoor, AAAI 2014), but do not at all follow from
that result. In particular, proving hardness for CCDV is harder than for CCAV
since we do not have control over what the controller can delete, and proving
easiness for bribery tends to be harder than for control, since bribery can be
viewed as control followed by manipulation.

 <dc:title>A Novel Approach for Mining Similarity Profiled Temporal Association

 <dc:description>  The problem of frequent pattern mining from non-temporal databases is studied
extensively by various researchers working in areas of data mining, temporal
databases and information retrieval. However, Conventional frequent pattern
algorithms are not suitable to find similar temporal association patterns from
temporal databases. A Temporal database is a database which can store past,
present and future information. The objective of this research is to come up
with a novel approach so as to find similar temporal association patterns w.r.t
user specified threshold and a given reference support time sequence using
concept of Venn diagrams. For this, we maintain two types of supports called
positive support and negative support values to find similar temporal
association patterns of user interest. The main advantage of our method is
that, it performs only a single scan of temporal database to find temporal
association patterns similar to specified reference support sequence. This
single database scan approach hence eliminates the huge overhead incurred when
the database is scanned multiple times. The present approach also eliminates
the need to compute and maintain true support values of all the subsets of
temporal patterns of previous stages when computing temporal patterns of next
stage.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a setting for learning possibilistic logic theories from
defaults of the form &quot;if alpha then typically beta&quot;. We first analyse this
problem from the point of view of machine learning theory, determining the VC
dimension of possibilistic stratifications as well as the complexity of the
associated learning problems, after which we present a heuristic learning
algorithm that can easily scale to thousands of defaults. An important property
of our approach is that it is inherently able to handle noisy and conflicting
sets of defaults. Among others, this allows us to learn possibilistic logic
theories from crowdsourced data and to approximate propositional Markov logic
networks using heuristic MAP solvers. We present experimental results that
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

 <dc:description>  Clustering Transactions in sequence, temporal and time series databases is
achieving an important attention from the database researchers and software
industry. Significant research is carried out towards defining and validating
the suitability of new similarity measures for sequence, temporal, time series
databases which can accurately and efficiently find the similarity between user
transactions in the given database to predict the user behavior. The
distribution of items present in the transactions contributes to a great extent
in finding the degree of similarity between them. This forms the key idea of
the proposed similarity measure. The main objective of the research is to first
design the efficient similarity measure which essentially considers the
distribution of the items in the item set over the entire transaction data set
and also considers the commonality of items present in the transactions, which
is the major drawback in the Jaccard, Cosine, Euclidean similarity measures. We
then carry out the analysis for worst case, the average case and best case
situations. The Similarity measure designed is Gaussian based and preserves the
properties of Gaussian function. The proposed similarity measure may be used to
both cluster and classify the user transactions and predict the user behaviors.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of predicting the results of computations that are too
expensive to run, via the observation of the results of smaller computations.
We model this as an online learning problem with delayed feedback, where the
length of the delay is unbounded, which we study mainly in a stochastic
setting. We show that in this setting, consistency is not possible in general,
and that optimal forecasters might not have average regret going to zero.
However, it is still possible to give algorithms that converge asymptotically
to Bayes-optimal predictions, by evaluating forecasters on specific sparse
independent subsequences of their predictions. We give an algorithm that does
this, which converges asymptotically on good behavior, and give very weak
bounds on how long it takes to converge. We then relate our results back to the
problem of predicting large computations in a deterministic setting.

 <dc:description>  The capacity of next generation of cellular networks using femtocaches is
studied when multihop communications and decentralized cache placement are
considered. We show that the storage capability of future network User
Terminals (UT) can be effectively used to increase the capacity in random
decentralized uncoded caching. We further propose a random decentralized coded

decentralized uncoded caching. The result shows that coded caching which is
suitable for systems with limited storage capabilities can improve the capacity
of cellular networks by a factor of log(n) where n is the number of nodes
served by the femtocache.

 <dc:description>  While probability theory is normally applied to external environments, there
has been some recent interest in probabilistic modeling of the outputs of
computations that are too expensive to run. Since mathematical logic is a
powerful tool for reasoning about computer programs, we consider this problem
from the perspective of integrating probability and logic. Recent work on
assigning probabilities to mathematical statements has used the concept of
coherent distributions, which satisfy logical constraints such as the
probability of a sentence and its negation summing to one. Although there are
algorithms which converge to a coherent probability distribution in the limit,
this yields only weak guarantees about finite approximations of these
distributions. In our setting, this is a significant limitation: Coherent
distributions assign probability one to all statements provable in a specific
logical theory, such as Peano Arithmetic, which can prove what the output of
any terminating computation is; thus, a coherent distribution must assign
probability one to the output of any terminating computation. To model
uncertainty about computations, we propose to work with approximations to
coherent distributions. We introduce inductive coherence, a strengthening of
coherence that provides appropriate constraints on finite approximations, and
propose an algorithm which satisfies this criterion.

 <dc:description>  A function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is referred to as a
Sparse Additive Model (SPAM), if it is of the form $f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{l \in
\mathcal{S}}\phi_{l}(x_l)$, where $\mathcal{S} \subset [d]$, $|\mathcal{S}| \ll
d$. Assuming $\phi_l$'s and $\mathcal{S}$ to be unknown, the problem of
estimating $f$ from its samples has been studied extensively. In this work, we
consider a generalized SPAM, allowing for second order interaction terms. For
some $\mathcal{S}_1 \subset [d], \mathcal{S}_2 \subset {[d] \choose 2}$, the
function $f$ is assumed to be of the form: $$f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{p \in
\mathcal{S}_1}\phi_{p} (x_p) + \sum_{(l,l^{\prime}) \in
\mathcal{S}_2}\phi_{(l,l^{\prime})} (x_{l},x_{l^{\prime}}).$$ Assuming
$\phi_{p},\phi_{(l,l^{\prime})}$, $\mathcal{S}_1$ and, $\mathcal{S}_2$ to be
unknown, we provide a randomized algorithm that queries $f$ and exactly
recovers $\mathcal{S}_1,\mathcal{S}_2$. Consequently, this also enables us to
estimate the underlying $\phi_p, \phi_{(l,l^{\prime})}$. We derive sample
complexity bounds for our scheme and also extend our analysis to include the
situation where the queries are corrupted with noise -- either stochastic, or
arbitrary but bounded. Lastly, we provide simulation results on synthetic data,
that validate our theoretical findings.

 <dc:description>  We develop a dynamic version of the primal-dual method for optimization
problems, and apply it to obtain the following results. (1) For the dynamic
set-cover problem, we maintain an $O(f^2)$-approximately optimal solution in
$O(f \cdot \log (m+n))$ amortized update time, where $f$ is the maximum
&quot;frequency&quot; of an element, $n$ is the number of sets, and $m$ is the maximum
number of elements in the universe at any point in time. (2) For the dynamic
$b$-matching problem, we maintain an $O(1)$-approximately optimal solution in
$O(\log^3 n)$ amortized update time, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the
graph.

 <dc:title>Metcalfe's Law Revisited</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Rudimentary mathematical analysis of simple network models suggests
bandwidth-independent saturation of network growth dynamics and hints at linear
decrease in information density of the data. However it strongly confirms
Metcalfe's law as a measure of network utility and suggests it can play an
important role in network calculations. This paper establishes mathematical
notion of network value and analyses two conflicting models of network. One,
traditional model, fails to manifest Metcalfe's law. Another model, one that
observes network in a wider context, both confirms Metcalfe's law and reveals
its upper boundary.

 <dc:title>Counting and Enumerating Crossing-free Geometric Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wettstein, Manuel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We describe a framework for counting and enumerating various types of
crossing-free geometric graphs on a planar point set. The framework generalizes
ideas of Alvarez and Seidel, who used them to count triangulations in time
$O(2^nn^2)$ where $n$ is the number of points. The main idea is to reduce the
problem of counting geometric graphs to counting source-sink paths in a
directed acyclic graph.
  The following new results will emerge. The number of all crossing-free
geometric graphs can be computed in time $O(c^nn^4)$ for some $c &lt; 2.83929$.
The number of crossing-free convex partitions can be computed in time
$O(2^nn^4)$. The number of crossing-free perfect matchings can be computed in
time $O(2^nn^4)$. The number of convex subdivisions can be computed in time
$O(2^nn^4)$. The number of crossing-free spanning trees can be computed in time
$O(c^nn^4)$ for some $c &lt; 7.04313$. The number of crossing-free spanning cycles
can be computed in time $O(c^nn^4)$ for some $c &lt; 5.61804$.
  With the same bounds on the running time we can construct data structures
which allow fast enumeration of the respective classes. For example, after
$O(2^nn^4)$ time of preprocessing we can enumerate the set of all crossing-free
perfect matchings using polynomial time per enumerated object. For
crossing-free perfect matchings and convex partitions we further obtain
enumeration algorithms where the time delay for each (in particular, the first)
output is bounded by a polynomial in $n$.
  All described algorithms are comparatively simple, both in terms of their
analysis and implementation.

 <dc:description>  Mappings of classical computation onto statistical mechanics models have led
to remarkable successes in addressing some complex computational problems.
However, such mappings display thermodynamic phase transitions that may prevent
reaching solution even for easy problems known to be solvable in polynomial
time. Here we map universal reversible classical computations onto a planar
vertex model that exhibits no bulk classical thermodynamic phase transition,
independent of the computational circuit. Within our approach the solution of
the computation is encoded in the ground state of the vertex model and its
complexity is reflected in the dynamics of the relaxation of the system to its
ground state. We use thermal annealing with and without 'learning' to explore
typical computational problems. We also construct a mapping of the vertex model
into the Chimera architecture of the D-Wave machine, initiating an approach to
reversible classical computation based on state-of-the-art implementations of
quantum annealing.

 <dc:description>  Rural areas continue to be plagued by limited data connectivity due to poor
and unreliable power infrastructure, poor backhaul connectivity and lack of
economic incentives for telecom providers. These factors continue to be an
impediment to providing reliable, highly available and bandwidth intensive
mobile services and applications to function well in such contexts. This paper
presents the design, implementation and deployment of GreenLinks, a new
ground-up platform that enables intermittency-aware, reliable and available
cellular services and application support in rural contexts under extreme
operational environments with limited power and no existing cellular coverage.
Unlike the conventional monolithic cellular network architecture, GreenLinks
enables a distributed (and potentially disjoint) collection of open,
programmable cellular base stations to offer a gamut of both conventional
cellular services and new forms of distributed edge services. GreenLinks offers
new application primitives to support different types of intermittency-aware
distributed mobile edge services including P2P transactions, voice-based social
media applications, and distributed mobile sensing applications. Using a
participatory sensing white spaces approach, a GreenLinks base stati

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce new methods and discuss results of text-based
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for automatic music composition. The
proposed network is designed to learn relationships within text documents that
represent chord progressions and drum tracks in two case studies. In the
experiments, word-RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) show good results for both
cases, while character-based RNNs (char-RNNs) only succeed to learn chord
progressions. The proposed system can be used for fully automatic composition
or as semi-automatic systems that help humans to compose music by controlling a
diversity parameter of the model.

 <dc:description>  Academic publishers claim that they add value to scholarly communications by
coordinating reviews and contributing and enhancing text during publication.
These contributions come at a considerable cost: U.S. academic libraries paid
$1.7 billion for serial subscriptions in 2008 alone. Library budgets, in
contrast, are flat and not able to keep pace with serial price inflation. We
have investigated the publishers' value proposition by conducting a comparative
study of pre-print papers and their final published counterparts. This
comparison had two working assumptions: 1) if the publishers' argument is
valid, the text of a pre-print paper should vary measurably from its
corresponding final published version, and 2) by applying standard similarity
measures, we should be able to detect and quantify such differences. Our
analysis revealed that the text contents of the scientific papers generally
changed very little from their pre-print to final published versions. These
findings contribute empirical indicators to discussions of the added value of
commercial publishers and therefore should influence libraries' economic
decisions regarding access to scholarly publications.

 <dc:description>  We present our experience in applying distributional semantics (neural word
embeddings) to the problem of representing and clustering documents in a
bilingual comparable corpus. Our data is a collection of Russian and Ukrainian
academic texts, for which topics are their academic fields. In order to build
language-independent semantic representations of these documents, we train
neural distributional models on monolingual corpora and learn the optimal
linear transformation of vectors from one language to another. The resulting
vectors are then used to produce `semantic fingerprints' of documents, serving
as input to a clustering algorithm.
  The presented method is compared to several baselines including `orthographic
translation' with Levenshtein edit distance and outperforms them by a large
margin. We also show that language-independent `semantic fingerprints' are
superior to multi-lingual clustering algorithms proposed in the previous work,
at the same time requiring less linguistic resources.

perform churn prediction by leveraging deep learning architectures prominent in
image classification. Supervised learning was performed on labeled data of over
6 million customers using deep convolutional neural networks, which achieved an
AUC of 0.743 on the test dataset using no more than 12 temporal features for
each customer. Unsupervised learning was conducted using autoencoders to better
understand the reasons for customer churn. Images that maximally activate the
hidden units of an autoencoder trained with churned customers reveal ample
opportunities for action to be taken to prevent churn among strong data, no

 <dc:description>  Discriminative deep learning approaches have shown impressive results for
problems where human-labeled ground truth is plentiful, but what about tasks
where labels are difficult or impossible to obtain? This paper tackles one such
problem: establishing dense visual correspondence across different object
instances. For this task, although we do not know what the ground-truth is, we
know it should be consistent across instances of that category. We exploit this
consistency as a supervisory signal to train a convolutional neural network to
predict cross-instance correspondences between pairs of images depicting
objects of the same category. For each pair of training images we find an
appropriate 3D CAD model and render two synthetic views to link in with the
pair, establishing a correspondence flow 4-cycle. We use ground-truth
synthetic-to-synthetic correspondences, provided by the rendering engine, to
train a ConvNet to predict synthetic-to-real, real-to-real and
real-to-synthetic correspondences that are cycle-consistent with the
ground-truth. At test time, no CAD models are required. We demonstrate that our
end-to-end trained ConvNet supervised by cycle-consistency outperforms
state-of-the-art pairwise matching methods in correspondence-related tasks.

 <dc:title>A Model-based Approach for Effective Service Delivery</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the prevalence of X-as-a-Service (e.g., software as a service, platform
as a service, infrastructure as a service, etc.) and users' growing demand on
good services, QoS (Quality of Service) assurance is becoming increasingly
important to service delivery. Traditional service delivery mainly focuses on
function or information provisioning, and does not give high priority to
quality assurance. In this paper, we tackle the QoS assurance problem in a
systematic way, from model to system. We first decompose traditional services
into three components - namely software application, data and resource, then
define models for these three kinds of basic services, and propose a set of
operations for service publishing and composition. To illustrate our approach,
we present a prototype system, the Platform as a Service (PaaS) system, which
is developed in support of our framework and shows how QoS can be ensured
through real-time monitoring and dynamic scaling (up or down).

 <dc:title>An Adaptive Learning Mechanism for Selection of Increasingly More
  Complex Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently it has been demonstrated that causal entropic forces can lead to the
emergence of complex phenomena associated with human cognitive niche such as
tool use and social cooperation. Here I show that even more fundamental traits
associated with human cognition such as 'self-awareness' can easily be
demonstrated to be arising out of merely a selection for 'better regulators';
i.e. systems which respond comparatively better to threats to their existence
which are internal to themselves. A simple model demonstrates how indeed the
average self-awareness for a universe of systems continues to rise as less
self-aware systems are eliminated. The model also demonstrates however that the
maximum attainable self-awareness for any system is limited by the plasticity
and energy availability for that typology of systems. I argue that this rise in
self-awareness may be the reason why systems tend towards greater complexity.

 <dc:description>  One approach, for understanding human brain functioning, is to analyze the
changes in the brain while performing cognitive tasks. Towards this, Functional
Magnetic Resonance (fMR) images of subjects performing well-defined tasks are
widely utilized for task-specific analyses. In this work, we propose a
procedure to enable classification between two chosen cognitive tasks, using
their respective fMR image sequences. The time series of expert-marked
anatomically-mapped relevant voxels are processed and fed as input to the
classical Naive Bayesian and SVM classifiers. The processing involves use of
random sieve function, phase information in the data transformed using Fourier
and Hilbert transformations. This processing results in improved
classification, as against using the voxel intensities directly, as
illustrated. The novelty of the proposed method lies in utilizing the phase
information in the transformed domain, for classifying between the cognitive
tasks along with random sieve function chosen with a particular probability
distribution. The proposed classification procedure is applied on a publicly
available dataset, StarPlus data, with 6 subjects performing the two distinct
cognitive tasks of watching either a picture or a sentence. The classification
accuracy stands at an average of 65.6%(using Naive Bayes classifier) and
76.4%(using SVM classifier) for raw data. The corresponding classification
accuracy stands at 96.8% and 97.5% for Fourier transformed data. For Hilbert
transformed data, it is 93.7% and 99%, for 6 subjects, on 2 cognitive tasks.

 <dc:description>  Despite significant progress made over the past twenty five years,
unconstrained face verification remains a challenging problem. This paper
proposes an approach that couples a deep CNN-based approach with a
low-dimensional discriminative embedding learned using triplet probability
constraints to solve the unconstrained face verification problem. Aside from
yielding performance improvements, this embedding provides significant
advantages in terms of memory and for post-processing operations like subject
specific clustering. Experiments on the challenging IJB-A dataset show that the
proposed algorithm performs comparably or better than the state of the art
methods in verification and identification metrics, while requiring much less
training data and training time. The superior performance of the proposed
method on the CFP dataset shows that the representation learned by our deep CNN
is robust to extreme pose variation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness
of the deep features to challenges including age, pose, blur and clutter by
performing simple clustering experiments on both IJB-A and LFW datasets.

 <dc:title>Extending the Harper Identity to Iterated Belief Change</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chandler, Jake</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Booth, Richard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The field of iterated belief change has focused mainly on revision, with the
other main operator of AGM belief change theory, i.e. contraction, receiving
relatively little attention. In this paper we extend the Harper Identity from
single-step change to define iterated contraction in terms of iterated
revision. Specifically, just as the Harper Identity provides a recipe for
defining the belief set resulting from contracting A in terms of (i) the
initial belief set and (ii) the belief set resulting from revision by not-A, we
look at ways to define the plausibility ordering over worlds resulting from
contracting A in terms of (iii) the initial plausibility ordering, and (iv) the
plausibility ordering resulting from revision by not-A. After noting that the
most straightforward such extension leads to a trivialisation of the space of
permissible orderings, we provide a family of operators for combining
plausibility orderings that avoid such a result. These operators are
characterised in our domain of interest by a pair of intuitively compelling
properties, which turn out to enable the derivation of a number of iterated
contraction postulates from postulates for iterated revision. We finish by
observing that a salient member of this family allows for the derivation of
counterparts for contraction of some well known iterated revision operators, as
well as for defining new iterated contraction operators.

 <dc:description>  This paper uses a bipartite network model to calculate the coverage achieved
by a delay-tolerant information dissemination algorithm in a specialized
setting. The specialized Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) system comprises static
message buffers or throwboxes kept in popular places besides the mobile agents
hopping from one place to another. We identify that an information
dissemination technique that exploits the throwbox infrastructure can cover
only a fixed number of popular places irrespective of the time spent. We notice
that such DTN system has a natural bipartite network correspondence where two
sets are the popular places and people visiting those places. This helps
leveraging the theories of evolving bipartite networks (BNW) to provide an
appropriate explanation of the observed temporal invariance of information
coverage over the DTN. In this work, we first show that information coverage
can be estimated by the size of the largest component in the thresholded
one-mode projection of BNW. Next, we also show that exploiting a special
property of BNW, the size of the largest component size can be calculated from
the degree distribution. Combining these two, we derive a closed form simple
equation to accurately predict the amount of information coverage in DTN which
is almost impossible to achieve using the traditional techniques such as
epidemic or Markov modeling. The equation shows that full coverage quickly
becomes extremely difficult to achieve if the number of places increases while
variation in agent's activity helps in covering more places.

 <dc:description>  The paper presents a comparative study of the performance of Back Propagation
and Instance Based Learning Algorithm for classification tasks. The study is
carried out by a series of experiments will all possible combinations of
parameter values for the algorithms under evaluation. The algorithm's
classification accuracy is compared over a range of datasets and measurements
like Cross Validation, Kappa Statistics, Root Mean Squared Value and True
Positive vs False Positive rate have been used to evaluate their performance.
Along with performance comparison, techniques of handling missing values have
also been compared that include Mean or Mode replacement and Multiple
Imputation. The results showed that parameter adjustment plays vital role in
improving an algorithm's accuracy and therefore, Back Propagation has shown
better results as compared to Instance Based Learning. Furthermore, the problem
of missing values was better handled by Multiple imputation method, however,
not suitable for less amount of data.

 <dc:title>Binary Multi-Level Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zinovyev, Anatoliy</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mark, Brian L.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Routing in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) presents a big challenge,
especially when support for a large number of nodes is needed. This paper
extends the local visibility concept of the recent DHT-based URBAN_XOR routing
protocol, which aims to reduce routing table sizes while keeping efficiency
high. Our main contribution is providing a guarantee that if any two nodes are
connected through other nodes, they are able to communicate with each other. We
propose a new route acquisition method that aims to reduce the total amount of
overhead traffic and improve convergence rate. In addition, we introduce an
abstraction for describing the network structure that makes it easy to
understand and analyze. Compared to existing approaches in ad hoc routing, the
new protocol supports the following features: scalability, guaranteed
connectivity assuming network convergence, absence of single points of failure,
low path-stretch, and mobility.

language $C^k(L)$, which consists of all words obtained by partitioning words
from $L$ into $k$ factors and permuting them. We prove that the classes of ET0L

 <dc:description>  To improve the temporal and spatial storage efficiency, researchers have
intensively studied various techniques, including compression and
deduplication. Through our evaluation, we find that methods such as photo tags
or local features help to identify the content-based similar- ity between raw
images. The images can then be com- pressed more efficiently to get better
storage space sav- ings. Furthermore, storing similar raw images together
enables rapid data sorting, searching and retrieval if the images are stored in
a distributed and large-scale envi- ronment by reducing fragmentation. In this
paper, we evaluated the compressibility by designing experiments and observing
the results. We found that on a statistical basis the higher similarity photos
have, the better com- pression results are. This research helps provide a clue
for future large-scale storage system design.

 <dc:description>  Finding a small spectral approximation for a tall $n \times d$ matrix $A$ is
a fundamental numerical primitive. For a number of reasons, one often seeks an
approximation whose rows are sampled from those of $A$. Row sampling improves
interpretability, saves space when $A$ is sparse, and preserves row structure,
which is especially important, for example, when $A$ represents a graph.
  However, correctly sampling rows from $A$ can be costly when the matrix is
large and cannot be stored and processed in memory. Hence, a number of recent
publications focus on row sampling in the streaming setting, using little more
space than what is required to store the outputted approximation [KL13,
KLM+14].
  Inspired by a growing body of work on online algorithms for machine learning
and data analysis, we extend this work to a more restrictive online setting: we
read rows of $A$ one by one and immediately decide whether each row should be
kept in the spectral approximation or discarded, without ever retracting these
decisions. We present an extremely simple algorithm that approximates $A$ up to
multiplicative error $\epsilon$ and additive error $\delta$ using $O(d \log d
\log(\epsilon||A||_2/\delta)/\epsilon^2)$ online samples, with memory overhead
proportional to the cost of storing the spectral approximation. We also present
an algorithm that uses $O(d^2$) memory but only requires
$O(d\log(\epsilon||A||_2/\delta)/\epsilon^2)$ samples, which we show is
optimal.
  Our methods are clean and intuitive, allow for lower memory usage than prior
work, and expose new theoretical properties of leverage score based matrix
approximation.

 <dc:description>  It is challenging to handle a large volume of labels in multi-label learning.
However, existing approaches explicitly or implicitly assume that all the
labels in the learning process are given, which could be easily violated in
changing environments. In this paper, we define and study streaming label
learning (SLL), i.e., labels are arrived on the fly, to model newly arrived
labels with the help of the knowledge learned from past labels. The core of SLL
is to explore and exploit the relationships between new labels and past labels
and then inherit the relationship into hypotheses of labels to boost the
performance of new classifiers. In specific, we use the label
self-representation to model the label relationship, and SLL will be divided
into two steps: a regression problem and a empirical risk minimization (ERM)
problem. Both problems are simple and can be efficiently solved. We further
show that SLL can generate a tighter generalization error bound for new labels
than the general ERM framework with trace norm or Frobenius norm
regularization. Finally, we implement extensive experiments on various
benchmark datasets to validate the new setting. And results show that SLL can
effectively handle the constantly emerging new labels and provides excellent
classification performance.

are only effective for recovering data with at most 90\% missing values. Thus,
we exploit visual data's smoothness property to help solve this challenging
extreme visual recovery problem. Based on the Discrete Cosine Transformation
(DCT), we propose a novel DCT norm that involves all pixels and produces smooth
estimations in any view. Our theoretical analysis shows that the total
variation (TV) norm, which only achieves local smoothness, is a special case of
the proposed DCT norm. We also develop a new visual recovery algorithm by
minimizing the DCT and nuclear norms to achieve a more visually pleasing
estimation. Experimental results on a benchmark image dataset demonstrate that
the proposed approach is superior to state-of-the-art methods in terms of peak
signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity.

 <dc:description>  Long memory or long range dependency is an important phenomenon that may
arise in the analysis of time series or spatial data. Most of the definitions
of long memory of a stationary process $X=\{X_1, X_2,\cdots,\}$ are based on
the second-order properties of the process. The excess entropy of a stationary
process is the summation of redundancies which relates to the rate of
convergence of the conditional entropy $H(X_n|X_{n-1},\cdots, X_1)$ to the
entropy rate. It is proved that the excess entropy is identical to the mutual
information between the past and the future when the entropy $H(X_1)$ is
finite. We suggest the definition that a stationary process is long memory if
the excess entropy is infinite. Since the definition of excess entropy of a
stationary process requires very weak moment condition on the distribution of
the process, it can be applied to processes whose distributions without bounded
second moment. A significant property of excess entropy is that it is invariant
under invertible transformation, which enables us to know the excess entropy of
a stationary process from the excess entropy of other process. For stationary
Guassian process, the excess entropy characterization of long memory relates to
popular characterization well. It is proved that the excess entropy of
fractional Gaussian noise is infinite if the Hurst parameter $H \in (1/2, 1)$.

 <dc:description>  This work investigates the cooperative output regulation problem of linear
multi-agent systems with hybrid sampled data control. Due to the limited data
sensing and communication, in many practical situations, only sampled data are
available for the cooperation of multi-agent systems. To overcome this problem,
a distributed hybrid controller is presented for the cooperative output
regulation, and cooperative output regulation is achieved by well designed
state feedback law. Then it proposed a method for the designing of sampled data
controller to solve the cooperative output regulation problem with continuous
linear systems and discrete-time communication data. Finally, numerical
simulation example for cooperative tracking and a simulation example for
optimal control of micro-grids are proposed to illustrate the result of the
sampled data control law.

 <dc:title>An Online Structural Plasticity Rule for Generating Better Reservoirs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Roy, Subhrajit</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Basu, Arindam</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this article, a novel neuro-inspired low-resolution online unsupervised
learning rule is proposed to train the reservoir or liquid of Liquid State
Machine. The liquid is a sparsely interconnected huge recurrent network of
spiking neurons. The proposed learning rule is inspired from structural
plasticity and trains the liquid through formation and elimination of synaptic
connections. Hence, the learning involves rewiring of the reservoir connections
similar to structural plasticity observed in biological neural networks. The
network connections can be stored as a connection matrix and updated in memory
by using Address Event Representation (AER) protocols which are generally
employed in neuromorphic systems. On investigating the 'pairwise separation
property' we find that trained liquids provide 1.36 $\pm$ 0.18 times more
inter-class separation while retaining similar intra-class separation as
compared to random liquids. Moreover, analysis of the 'linear separation
property' reveals that trained liquids are 2.05 $\pm$ 0.27 times better than
random liquids. Furthermore, we show that our liquids are able to retain the
'generalization' ability and 'generality' of random liquids. A memory analysis
shows that trained liquids have 83.67 $\pm$ 5.79 ms longer fading memory than
random liquids which have shown 92.8 $\pm$ 5.03 ms fading memory for a
particular type of spike train inputs. We also throw some light on the dynamics
of the evolution of recurrent connections within the liquid. Moreover, compared
to 'Separation Driven Synaptic Modification' - a recently proposed algorithm
for iteratively refining reservoirs, our learning rule provides 9.30%, 15.21%
and 12.52% more liquid separations and 2.8%, 9.1% and 7.9% better
classification accuracies for four, eight and twelve class pattern recognition
tasks respectively.

 <dc:description>  Offloading computation to a mobile cloud is a promising solution to augment
the computation capabilities of mobile devices. In this paper we consider
selfish mobile devices in a dense wireless network, in which individual mobile
devices can offload computations via multiple access points (APs) to a mobile
cloud so as to minimize their computation costs, and we provide a game
theoretical analysis of the problem. We show that in the case of an elastic
cloud, all improvement paths are finite, and thus a pure strategy Nash
equilibrium exists and can be computed easily. In the case of a non-elastic
cloud we show that improvement paths may cycle, yet we show that a pure Nash
equilibrium exists and we provide an efficient algorithm for computing one.
Furthermore, we provide an upper bound on the price of anarchy (PoA) of the
game. We use simulations to evaluate the time complexity of computing Nash
equilibria and to provide insights into the PoA under realistic scenarios. Our
results show that the equilibrium cost may be close to optimal, and the cost
difference is due to too many mobile users offloading simultaneously.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes our solution for WSDM Cup 2016. Ranking the query
independent importance of scholarly articles is a critical and challenging
task, due to the heterogeneity and dynamism of entities involved. Our approach
is called Ensemble enabled Weighted PageRank (EWPR). To do this, we first
propose Time-Weighted PageRank that extends PageRank by introducing a time
decaying factor. We then develop an ensemble method to assemble the authorities
of the heterogeneous entities involved in scholarly articles. We finally
propose to use external data sources to further improve the ranking accuracy.
Our experimental study shows that our EWPR is a good choice for ranking
scholarly articles.

 <dc:description>  Online user reviews describing various products and services are now abundant
on the web. While the information conveyed through review texts and ratings is
easily comprehensible, there is a wealth of hidden information in them that is
not immediately obvious. In this study, we unlock this hidden value behind user
reviews to understand the various dimensions along which users rate products.
We learn a set of users that represent each of these dimensions and use their
ratings to predict product ratings. Specifically, we work with restaurant
reviews to identify users whose ratings are influenced by dimensions like
'Service', 'Atmosphere' etc. in order to predict restaurant ratings and
understand the variation in rating behaviour across different cuisines. While
previous approaches to obtaining product ratings require either a large number
of user ratings or a few review texts, we show that it is possible to predict
ratings with few user ratings and no review text. Our experiments show that our
approach outperforms other conventional methods by 16-27% in terms of RMSE.

 <dc:description>  With the increase in adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), proper utilization
of the charging infrastructure is an emerging challenge for service providers.
Overstaying of an EV after a charging event is a key contributor to low
utilization. Since overstaying is easily detectable by monitoring the power
drawn from the charger, managing this problem primarily involves designing an
appropriate &quot;penalty&quot; during the overstaying period. Higher penalties do
discourage overstaying; however, due to uncertainty in parking duration, less
people would find such penalties acceptable, leading to decreased utilization
(and revenue). To analyze this central trade-off, we develop a novel framework
that integrates models for realistic user behavior into queueing dynamics to
locate the optimal penalty from the points of view of utilization and revenue,
for different values of the external charging demand. Next, when the model
parameters are unknown, we show how an online learning algorithm, such as UCB,
can be adapted to learn the optimal penalty. Our experimental validation, based
on charging data from London, shows that an appropriate penalty can increase
both utilization and revenue while significantly reducing overstaying.

 <dc:description>  Effective placement of charging stations plays a key role in Electric Vehicle
(EV) adoption. In the placement problem, given a set of candidate sites, an
optimal subset needs to be selected with respect to the concerns of both (a)
the charging station service provider, such as the demand at the candidate
sites and the budget for deployment, and (b) the EV user, such as charging
station reachability and short waiting times at the station. This work
addresses these concerns, making the following three novel contributions: (i) a
supervised multi-view learning framework using Canonical Correlation Analysis
(CCA) for demand prediction at candidate sites, using multiple datasets such as
points of interest information, traffic density, and the historical usage at
existing charging stations; (ii) a mixed-packing-and- covering optimization
framework that models competing concerns of the service provider and EV users;
(iii) an iterative heuristic to solve these problems by alternately invoking
knapsack and set cover algorithms. The performance of the demand prediction
model and the placement optimization heuristic are evaluated using real world
data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate detectability and identifiability of attacks on
linear dynamical systems that are subjected to external disturbances. We
generalize a concept for a security index, which was previously introduced for
static systems. The generalized index exactly quantifies the resources
necessary for targeted attacks to be undetectable and unidentifiable in the
presence of disturbances. This information is useful for both risk assessment
and for the design of anomaly detectors. Finally, we show how techniques from
the fault detection literature can be used to decouple disturbances and to
identify attacks, under certain sparsity constraints.

 <dc:description>  This paper outlines the development of a wearable game controller
incorporating vibrotacticle haptic feedback that provides a low cost, versatile
and intuitive interface for controlling digital games. The device differs from
many traditional haptic feedback implementation in that it combines
vibrotactile based haptic feedback with gesture based input, thus becoming a
two way conduit between the user and the virtual environment. The device is
intended to challenge what is considered an &quot;interface&quot; and draws on work in
the area of Actor-Network theory to purposefully blur the boundary between man
and machine. This allows for a more immersive experience, so rather than making
the user feel like they are controlling an aircraft the intuitive interface
allows the user to become the aircraft that is controlled by the movements of
the user's hand. This device invites playful action and thrill. It bridges new
territory on portable and low cost solutions for haptic controllers in a gaming
context.

 <dc:title>On Distributed Internal Model Principle for Output Regulation over
  Time-Varying Networks of Linear Heterogeneous Agents</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cai, Kai</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study a multi-agent output regulation problem, where not all agents have
access to the exosystem's dynamics. We propose a distributed controller that
solves the problem for linear, heterogeneous, and uncertain agent dynamics as
well as time-varying directed networks. The distributed controller consists of
two parts: (1) an exosystem generator that creates a local copy of the
exosystem dynamics by using consensus protocols, and (2) a dynamic compensator
that uses (again) consensus to approach the internal model of the exosystem and
thereby achieves perfect output regulation. Our approach leverages methods from
internal model based controller synthesis, multi-agent consensus over directed
networks, and stability of time-varying linear systems; the derived result is
an adaptation of the (centralized) internal model principle to the distributed,
networked setting.

separation. The impact of 3-D antenna sectorization on SWIPT performance is
evaluated for the power-splitting technique by using stochastic geometry tools.
Theoretical and numerical results show that 3-D sectorization achieves a more
accurate beam steering in the 3-D space, which can be beneficial for both the
information and the power transfer.

 <dc:description>  Non-deterministic Constraint Logic is a family of graph games introduced by
Demaine and Hearn that facilitates the construction of complexity proofs. It is
convenient for the analysis of games, providing a uniform view. We focus on the
acyclic version, apply this to Klondike, Mahjong Solitaire and Nonogram (that
requires planarity), and discuss the more complicated game of Dou Shou Qi.
While for the first three games we reobtain known characterizations in a simple
and uniform manner, the result for Dou Shou Qi is new.

 <dc:description>  The spread of new beliefs, behaviors, conventions, norms, and technologies in
social and economic networks are often driven by cascading mechanisms, and so
are contagion dynamics in financial networks. Global behaviors generally emerge
from the interplay between the structure of the interconnection topology and
the local agents' interactions. We focus on the Linear Threshold Model (LTM) of
cascades first introduced by Granovetter (1978). This can be interpreted as the
best response dynamics in a network game whereby agents choose strategically
between two actions and their payoff is an increasing function of the number of
their neighbors choosing the same action. Each agent is equipped with an
individual threshold representing the number of her neighbors who must have
adopted a certain action for that to become the agent's best response. We
analyze the LTM dynamics on large-scale networks with heterogeneous agents.
Through a local mean-field approach, we obtain a nonlinear, one-dimensional,
recursive equation that approximates the evolution of the LTM dynamics on most
of the networks of a given size and distribution of degrees and thresholds.
Specifically, we prove that, on all but a fraction of networks with given
degree and threshold statistics that is vanishing as the network size grows
large, the actual fraction of adopters of a given action in the LTM dynamics is
arbitrarily close to the output of the aforementioned recursion. We then
analyze the dynamic behavior of this recursion and its bifurcations from a
dynamical systems viewpoint. Applications of our findings to some real network
testbeds show good adherence of the theoretical predictions to numerical
simulations.

 <dc:description>  The Count-Min Sketch is a widely adopted structure for approximate event
counting in large scale processing. In a previous work we improved the original
version of the Count-Min-Sketch (CMS) with conservative update using
approximate counters instead of linear counters. These structures are
computationaly efficient and improve the average relative error (ARE) of a CMS
at constant memory footprint. These improvements are well suited for NLP tasks,
in which one is interested by the low-frequency items. However, if Log counters
allow to improve ARE, they produce a residual error due to the approximation.
In this paper, we propose the Count-Min Tree Sketch (Copyright 2016 eXenSa. All
rights reserved) variant with pyramidal counters, which are focused toward
taking advantage of the Zipfian distribution of text data.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in saliency detection have utilized deep learning to obtain
high level features to detect salient regions in a scene. These advances have
demonstrated superior results over previous works that utilize hand-crafted low
level features for saliency detection. In this paper, we demonstrate that
hand-crafted features can provide complementary information to enhance
performance of saliency detection that utilizes only high level features. Our
method utilizes both high level and low level features for saliency detection
under a unified deep learning framework. The high level features are extracted
using the VGG-net, and the low level features are compared with other parts of
an image to form a low level distance map. The low level distance map is then
encoded using a convolutional neural network(CNN) with multiple 1X1
convolutional and ReLU layers. We concatenate the encoded low level distance
map and the high level features, and connect them to a fully connected neural
network classifier to evaluate the saliency of a query region. Our experiments
show that our method can further improve the performance of state-of-the-art
deep learning-based saliency detection methods.

 <dc:description>  Many natural language processing (NLP) tasks can be generalized into
segmentation problem. In this paper, we combine semi-CRF with neural network to
solve NLP segmentation tasks. Our model represents a segment both by composing
the input units and embedding the entire segment. We thoroughly study different
composition functions and different segment embeddings. We conduct extensive
experiments on two typical segmentation tasks: named entity recognition (NER)
and Chinese word segmentation (CWS). Experimental results show that our neural
semi-CRF model benefits from representing the entire segment and achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on CWS benchmark dataset and competitive results
on the CoNLL03 dataset.

 <dc:description>  The challenges of robotic software testing extend beyond conventional
software testing. Valid, realistic and interesting tests need to be generated
for multiple programs and hardware running concurrently, deployed into dynamic
environments with people. We investigate the use of Belief-Desire-Intention
(BDI) agents as models for test generation, in the domain of human-robot
interaction (HRI) in simulations. These models provide rational agency,
causality, and a reasoning mechanism for planning, which emulate both
intelligent and adaptive robots, as well as smart testing environments directed
by humans. We introduce reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the exploration
of the BDI models using a reward function based on coverage feedback. Our
approach is evaluated using a collaborative manufacture example, where the
robotic software under test is stimulated indirectly via a simulated human
co-worker. We conclude that BDI agents provide intuitive models for test
generation in the HRI domain. Our results demonstrate that RL can fully
automate BDI model exploration, leading to very effective coverage-directed
test generation.

 <dc:description>  The reversible pebble game is a combinatorial game played on rooted DAGs.
This game was introduced by Bennett (1989) motivated by applications in
designing space efficient reversible algorithms. Recently, Chan (2013) showed
that the reversible pebble game number of any DAG is the same as its
Dymond-Tompa pebble number and Raz-Mckenzie pebble number.
  We show, as our main result, that for any rooted directed tree T, its
reversible pebble game number is always just one more than the edge rank
coloring number of the underlying undirected tree U of T. It is known that
given a DAG G as input, determining its reversible pebble game number is
PSPACE-hard. Our result implies that the reversible pebble game number of trees
can be computed in polynomial time.
  We also address the question of finding the number of steps required to
optimally pebble various families of trees. It is known that trees can be
pebbled in $n^{O(\log(n))}$ steps where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree.
Using the equivalence between reversible pebble game and the Dymond-Tompa
pebble game (Chan, 2013), we show that complete binary trees can be pebbled in
$n^{O(\log\log(n))}$ steps, a substantial improvement over the naive upper
bound of $n^{O(\log(n))}$. It remains open whether complete binary trees can be
pebbled in polynomial (in $n$) number of steps. Towards this end, we show that
almost optimal (i.e., within a factor of $(1 + \epsilon)$ for any constant
$\epsilon &gt; 0$) pebblings of complete binary trees can be done in polynomial
number of steps.
  We also show a time-space trade-off for reversible pebbling for families of
bounded degree trees by a divide-and-conquer approach: for any constant
$\epsilon &gt; 0$, such families can be pebbled using $O(n^\epsilon)$ pebbles in
$O(n)$ steps. This generalizes an analogous result of Kralovic (2001) for
chains.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Motivated by recent concerns that queuing delays in the Internet are on the
rise, we conduct a performance evaluation of Compound TCP (C-TCP) in two
topologies: a single bottleneck and a multi-bottleneck topology. The first
topology consists of a single core router, and the second consists of two
distinct sets of TCP flows, regulated by two edge routers, feeding into a
common core router. For both topologies, we develop fluid models and conduct a
detailed local stability analysis in the small buffer regime, and obtain
necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability. Further, we show that
the underlying non-linear models undergo a Hopf bifurcation as the stability
conditions just get violated. Using a combination of analysis and packet-level
simulations, we emphasise that larger buffer thresholds, in addition to
increasing latency, are prone to inducing limit cycles. These limit cycles in
turn cause synchronisation among the TCP flows, and also result in a loss of
link utilisation. For the single bottleneck topology, we empirically analyse
some statistical properties of the bottleneck queue. We highlight that in a
high bandwidth-delay product and a small buffer regime, and with a large number
of long-lived flows, the bottleneck queue may be modelled as an M/M/1/B or an
M/D/1/B queue. The combination of the dynamical and the statistical properties
explored in this paper could have important implications for quality of service
in the Internet.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent works using artificial neural networks based on distributed word
representation greatly boost performance on various natural language processing
tasks, especially the answer selection problem. Nevertheless, most of the
previous works used deep learning methods (like LSTM-RNN, CNN, etc.) only to
capture semantic representation of each sentence separately, without
considering the interdependence between each other. In this paper, we propose a
novel end-to-end learning framework which constitutes deep convolutional neural
network based on multi-modal similarity metric learning (M$^2$S-Net) on
pairwise tokens. The proposed model demonstrates its performance by surpassing
previous state-of-the-art systems on the answer selection benchmark, i.e.,
TREC-QA dataset, in both MAP and MRR metrics.

 <dc:description>  We present an analytical approach to calculating the distribution of shortest
paths lengths (also called intervertex distances, or geodesic paths) between
nodes in unweighted undirected networks. We obtain very accurate results for
synthetic random networks with specified degree distribution (the so-called
configuration model networks). Our method allows us to accurately predict the
distribution of shortest path lengths on real-world networks using their degree
distribution, or joint degree-degree distribution. Compared to some other
methods, our approach is simpler and yields more accurate results. In order to
obtain the analytical results, we use the analogy between an infection reaching
a node in $n$ discrete time steps (i.e., as in the susceptible-infected
epidemic model) and that node being at a distance $n$ from the source of the
infection.

task of fine-grained entity type classification that unlike previously proposed
models recursively composes representations of entity mention contexts. Our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance with 74.94% loose micro F1-score on
the well-established FIGER dataset, a relative improvement of 2.59%. We also
investigate the behavior of the attention mechanism of our model and observe
that it can learn contextual linguistic expressions that indicate the
fine-grained category memberships of an entity.

 <dc:description>  Bidirectional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) networks have recently proven
successful for various NLP sequence modeling tasks, but little is known about
their reliance to input representations, target languages, data set size, and
label noise. We address these issues and evaluate bi-LSTMs with word,
character, and unicode byte embeddings for POS tagging. We compare bi-LSTMs to
traditional POS taggers across languages and data sizes. We also present a
novel bi-LSTM model, which combines the POS tagging loss function with an
auxiliary loss function that accounts for rare words. The model obtains
state-of-the-art performance across 22 languages, and works especially well for
morphologically complex languages. Our analysis suggests that bi-LSTMs are less
sensitive to training data size and label corruptions (at small noise levels)
than previously assumed.

 <dc:title>Distillation of secret key from a class of compound memoryless quantum

 <dc:description>  We consider secret-key distillation from tripartite compound
classical-quantum-quantum (cqq) sources with free forward public communication
under strong security criterion. We design protocols which are universally
reliable and secure in this scenario. These are shown to achieve asymptotically
optimal rates as long as a certain regularity condition is fulfilled by the the
set of its generating density matrices. We derive a multi-letter formula which
describes the optimal forward secret-key capacity for all compound cqq sources
being regular in this sense. We also determine the forward secret-key
distillation capacity for situations, where the legitimate sending party has
perfect knowledge of his/her marginal state deriving from the source
statistics. In this case regularity conditions can be dropped. Our results show
that the capacities with and without the mentioned kind of state knowledge are
equal as long as the source is generated by a regular set of density matrices.
We demonstrate that regularity of cqq sources is not only a technical but also
an operational issue. For this reason, we give an example of a source which has
zero secret-key distillation capacity without sender knowledge, while achieving
positive rates is possible if sender marginal knowledge is provided.

 <dc:title>Link Capacity Planning for Fault Tolerant Operation in Hybrid SDN/OSPF
  Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Caria, Marcel</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Jukan, Admela</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Link capacity dimensioning is the periodic task where ISPs have to make
provisions for sudden traffic bursts and network failures to assure
uninterrupted operations. This provision comes in the form of link working
capacities with noticeable amounts of headroom, i.e., spare capacities that are
used in case of congestions or network failures. Distributed routing protocols
like OSPF provide convergence after network failures and have proven their
reliable operation over decades, but require overprovisioning and headroom of
over 50%. However, SDN has recently been proposed to either replace or work
together with OSPF in routing Internet traffic. This paper addresses the
question of how to robustly dimension the link capacities in emerging hybrid
SDN/OSPF networks. We analyze the networks with various implementations of
hybrid SDN/OSPF control planes, and show that our idea of SDN Partitioning
requires less amounts of spare capacity compared to legacy or other hybrid
SDN/OSPF schemes, outperformed only by a full SDN deployment.

 <dc:title>The SP theory of intelligence and the representation and processing of
  knowledge in the brain</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wolff, J Gerard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The &quot;SP theory of intelligence&quot;, with its realisation in the &quot;SP computer
model&quot;, aims to simplify and integrate observations and concepts across
AI-related fields, with information compression as a unifying theme. This paper
describes how abstract structures and processes in the theory may be realised
in terms of neurons, their interconnections, and the transmission of signals
between neurons. This part of the SP theory -- &quot;SP-neural&quot; -- is a tentative
and partial model for the representation and processing of knowledge in the
brain. In the SP theory (apart from SP-neural), all kinds of knowledge are
represented with &quot;patterns&quot;, where a pattern is an array of atomic symbols in
one or two dimensions. In SP-neural, the concept of a &quot;pattern&quot; is realised as
an array of neurons called a &quot;pattern assembly&quot;, similar to Hebb's concept of a
&quot;cell assembly&quot; but with important differences. Central to the processing of
information in the SP system is the powerful concept of &quot;multiple alignment&quot;,
borrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. Processes such as pattern
recognition, reasoning and problem solving are achieved via the building of
multiple alignments, while unsupervised learning -- significantly different
from the &quot;Hebbian&quot; kinds of learning -- is achieved by creating patterns from
sensory information and also by creating patterns from multiple alignments in
which there is a partial match between one pattern and another. Short-lived
neural structures equivalent to multiple alignments will be created via an
inter-play of excitatory and inhibitory neural signals. The paper discusses
several associated issues, with relevant empirical evidence.

 <dc:description>  In this survey, we describe a general key exchange protocol based on
semidirect product of (semi)groups (more specifically, on extensions of
(semi)groups by automorphisms), and then focus on practical instances of this
general idea. This protocol can be based on any group or semigroup, in
particular on any non-commutative group. One of its special cases is the
standard Diffie-Hellman protocol, which is based on a cyclic group. However,
when this protocol is used with a non-commutative (semi)group, it acquires
several useful features that make it compare favorably to the Diffie-Hellman
protocol. The focus then shifts to selecting an optimal platform (semi)group,
in terms of security and efficiency. We show, in particular, that one can get a
variety of new security assumptions by varying an automorphism used for a
(semi)group extension.

 <dc:title>Easy to Win, Hard to Master: Optimal Strategies in Parity Games with

 <dc:subject>D.2.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The winning condition of a parity game with costs requires an arbitrary, but
fixed bound on the cost incurred between occurrences of odd colors and the next
occurrence of a larger even one. Such games quantitatively extend parity games
while retaining most of their attractive properties, i.e, determining the
winner is in NP and co-NP and one player has positional winning strategies.
  We show that the characteristics of parity games with costs are vastly
different when asking for strategies realizing the minimal such bound: The
solution problem becomes PSPACE-complete and exponential memory is both
necessary in general and always sufficient. Thus, solving and playing parity
games with costs optimally is harder than just winning them. Moreover, we show
that the tradeoff between the memory size and the realized bound is gradual in
general. All these results hold true for both a unary and binary encoding of
costs.
  Moreover, we investigate Streett games with costs. Here, playing optimally is
as hard as winning, both in terms of complexity and memory.

 <dc:title>Joint Coordinated Precoding and Discrete Rate Selection in Multicell
  MIMO Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Brandt, Rasmus</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Bengtsson, Mats</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many practical wireless communications systems select their transmit rate
from a finite set of modulation and coding schemes, which correspond to a set
of discrete rates. In this paper, we therefore formulate a joint coordinated
precoding and discrete rate selection problem for multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) multicell networks. Compared to the common assumption of
using the continuous Shannon rates as the user utilities, explicitly accounting
for the discrete rates more accurately models practical wireless communication
systems. The optimization problem that we formulate is combinatorial and
non-convex, however, and is thus hard to solve. We therefore rewrite the
problem using a discontinuous rate function, which we then bound using its
concave envelope in some domain. Based on block coordinate descent, we provide
a convergent resource allocation algorithm which can be implemented in a
semi-distributed fashion. Numerical performance evaluation shows performance
gains when the discrete rates are optimized using our model, as compared to the
traditional methods which use the continuous Shannon rates as the user
utilities.

 <dc:title>A Safety and Liveness Theory for Total Reversibility (Extended Abstract)</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mezzina, Claudio Antares</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Koutavas, Vasileios</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the theory of safety and liveness in a reversible calculus where
reductions are totally ordered and rollbacks lead the systems to past states.
Similar to previous work on communicating transactions, liveness and safety
respectively correspond to the should-testing and inverse may-testing
preorders. We develop fully abstract models for these preorders in a reversible
calculus, which are based only on forward transitions, thus providing a simple
proof technique for refinement of such systems. We show that with respect to
safety, total reversibility is a conservative extension to CCS. With respect to
liveness, however, adding total reversibility to CCS distinguishes more
systems. To our knowledge, this work provides the first characterisations of
safety and liveness, and the first testing theory for a reversible calculus.

 <dc:description>  We define a property of intelligent systems, which we call Reflexivity. In
human beings, it is one aspect of consciousness, and an element of
deliberation. We propose a conjecture, that this property is conditioned by a
topological property of the processes which implement this reflexivity. These
processes may be symbolic, or non symbolic e.g. connexionnist. An architecture
which implements reflexivity may be based on the interaction of one or several
modules of deep learning, which may be specialized or not, and interconnected
in a relevant way. A necessary condition of reflexivity is the existence of
recurrence in its processes, we will examine in which cases this condition may
be sufficient. We will then examine how this topology and this property make
possible the expression of a second property, the deliberation. In a final
paragraph, we propose an evaluation of intelligent systems, based on the
fulfillment of all or some of these properties.

 <dc:description>  Ad exchanges are an emerging platform for trading advertisement slots on the
web with billions of dollars revenue per year. Every time a user visits a web
page, the publisher of that web page can ask an ad exchange to auction off the
ad slots on this page to determine which advertisements are shown at which
price. Due to the high volume of traffic, ad networks typically act as
mediators for individual advertisers at ad exchanges. If multiple advertisers
in an ad network are interested in the ad slots of the same auction, the ad
network might use a &quot;local&quot; auction to resell the obtained ad slots among its
advertisers.
  In this work we want to deepen the theoretical understanding of these new
markets by analyzing them from the viewpoint of combinatorial auctions. Prior
work studied mostly single-item auctions, while we allow the advertisers to
express richer preferences over multiple items. We develop a game-theoretic
model for the entanglement of the central auction at the ad exchange with the
local auctions at the ad networks. We consider the incentives of all three
involved parties and suggest a three-party competitive equilibrium, an
extension of the Walrasian equilibrium that ensures envy-freeness for all
participants. We show the existence of a three-party competitive equilibrium
and a polynomial-time algorithm to find one for gross-substitute bidder
valuations.

 <dc:description>  Transmission switching (TS) has gained significant attention recently.
However, barriers still remain and must be overcome before the technology can
be adopted by the industry. The state of the art challenges include AC
feasibility and performance, computational complexity, the ability to handle
large-scale real power systems, and dynamic stability. This two-part paper
investigates these challenges by developing an AC TS-based real-time
contingency analysis (RTCA) tool that can handle large-scale systems within a
reasonable time. The tool proposes multiple corrective switching actions, after
detection of a contingency with potential violations. To reduce the
computational complexity, three heuristic algorithms are proposed to generate a
small set of candidates for switching. Parallel computing is implemented to
further speed up the solution time. Furthermore, stability analysis is
performed to check for dynamic stability of proposed TS solutions. Part I of
the paper presents a comprehensive literature review and the methodology. The
promising results, tested on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) system and
actual energy management system (EMS) snapshots from Pennsylvania New Jersey

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the performance of an AC transmission switching (TS)
based real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) tool that is introduced in Part I
of this paper. The approach quickly proposes high quality corrective switching
actions for relief of potential post-contingency network violations. The
approach is confirmed by testing it on actual EMS snapshots of two large-scale
systems, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and the Pennsylvania
New Jersey Maryland (PJM) Interconnection; the approach is also tested on data
provided by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The results show that the
tool effectively reduces post-contingency violations. Fast heuristics are used
along with parallel computing to reduce the computational difficulty of the
problem. The tool is able to handle the PJM system in about five minutes with a
standard desktop computer. Time-domain simulations are performed to check
system stability with corrective transmission switching (CTS). In conclusion,
the paper shows that corrective switching is ripe for industry adoption. CTS
can provide significant reliability benefits that can be translated into
significant cost savings.

 <dc:description>  To generate a hypothesis about the effects of anonymity on user participation
in online communities, comments on Youtube were analysed for effects of the
change from allowing pseudonyms to Google+ with its real name policy. Small
differences were detected, leading to the hypothesis that the option to remain
anonymous leads to a less active environment for getting feedback, with less
polite and less rude comments on the expense of neutral ones.

 <dc:title>On Efficient Decoding and Design of Sparse Random Linear Network Codes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Random linear network coding (RLNC) in theory achieves the max-flow capacity
of multicast networks, at the cost of high decoding complexity. To improve the
performance-complexity tradeoff, we consider the design of sparse network
codes. A generation-based strategy is employed in which source packets are
grouped into overlapping subsets called generations. RLNC is performed only
amongst packets belonging to the same generation throughout the network so that
sparseness can be maintained. In this paper, generation-based network codes
with low reception overheads and decoding costs are designed for transmitting
of the order of $10^2$-$10^3$ source packets. A low-complexity
overhead-optimized decoder is proposed that exploits &quot;overlaps&quot; between
generations. The sparseness of the codes is exploited through local processing
and multiple rounds of pivoting of the decoding matrix. To demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach, codes comprising a binary precode, random overlapping
generations, and binary RLNC are designed. The results show that our designs
can achieve negligible code overheads at low decoding costs, and outperform
existing network codes that use the generation based strategy.

 <dc:title>Deciphering the complex intermediate role of health coverage through

 <dc:description>  Recent initiatives that overstate health insurance coverage for well-being
conflict with the recognized antagonistic facts identified by the determinants
of health that identify health care as an intermediate factor. By using a
network of controlled interdependences among multiple social resources
including health insurance, which we reconstructed from survey data of the U.S.
and Bayesian networks structure learning algorithms, we examined why health
insurance through coverage, which in most countries is the access gate to
health care, is just an intermediate factor of well-being. We used social
network analysis methods to explore the complex relationships involved at
general, specific and particular levels of the model. All levels provide
evidence that the intermediate role of health insurance relies in a strong
relationship to income and reproduces its unfair distribution. Some signals
about the most efficient type of health coverage emerged in our analyses.

 <dc:description>  Surrogate Text Representation (STR) is a profitable solution to efficient
similarity search on metric space using conventional text search engines, such
as Apache Lucene. This technique is based on comparing the permutations of some
reference objects in place of the original metric distance. However, the
Achilles heel of STR approach is the need to reorder the result set of the
search according to the metric distance. This forces to use a support database
to store the original objects, which requires efficient random I/O on a fast
secondary memory (such as flash-based storages). In this paper, we propose to
extend the Surrogate Text Representation to specifically address a class of
visual metric objects known as Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD).
This approach is based on representing the individual sub-vectors forming the
VLAD vector with the STR, providing a finer representation of the vector and
enabling us to get rid of the reordering phase. The experiments on a publicly
available dataset show that the extended STR outperforms the baseline STR
achieving satisfactory performance near to the one obtained with the original
VLAD vectors.

 <dc:description>  It is important to have multi-agent robotic system specifications that ensure
correctness properties of safety and liveness. As these systems have
concurrency, and often have dynamic environment, the formal specification and
verification of these systems along with step-wise refinement from abstract to
concrete concepts play a major role in system correctness. Formal verification
is used for exhaustive investigation of the system space thus ensuring that
undetected failures in the behavior are excluded. We construct the system
incrementally from subcomponents, based on software architecture. The challenge
is to develop a safe multi-agent robotic system, more specifically to ensure
the correctness properties of safety and liveness. Formal specifications based
on model-checking are flexible, have a concrete syntax, and play vital role in
correctness of a multi-agent robotic system. To formally verify safety and
liveness of such systems is important because they have high concurrency and in
most of the cases have dynamic environment. We have considered a case-study of
a multi-agent robotic system for the transport of stock between storehouses to
exemplify our formal approach. Our proposed development approach allows for
formal verification during specification definition. The development process
has been classified in to four major phases of requirement specifications,
verification specifications, architecture specifications and implementation.

 <dc:description>  We establish a relationship between decay centrality and two widely used and
computationally cheaper measures of centrality, namely degree and closeness. We
show that for low values of the decay parameter the nodes with maximum decay
centrality also have maximum degree, whereas for high values of the decay
parameter they also maximize closeness. For intermediate values, we provide
sufficient conditions that allow the comparison of decay centrality of
different nodes and we show via numerical simulations that in the vast majority
of networks, the nodes with maximum decay centrality are characterized by a
threshold on the decay parameter below which they belong to the set of nodes
with maximum degree and above which they belong to the set of nodes with
maximum closeness. We also propose a simple rule of thumb that ensures a nearly
optimal choice with very high probability.

 <dc:description>  We show NP-completeness for several planar variants of the monotone

the presented variants have an associated bipartite graph where the vertex
degree is bounded by at most four. Hence, a planar and orthogonal drawing for
these graphs can be computed efficiently, which may turn out to be useful in
reductions using these variants as a starting point for proving some decision
problem to be NP-hard.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an approach to matching images of objects in fine-grained datasets
without using part annotations, with an application to the challenging problem
of weakly supervised single-view reconstruction. This is in contrast to prior
works that require part annotations, since matching objects across class and
pose variations is challenging with appearance features alone. We overcome this
challenge through a novel deep learning architecture, WarpNet, that aligns an
object in one image with a different object in another. We exploit the
structure of the fine-grained dataset to create artificial data for training
this network in an unsupervised-discriminative learning approach. The output of
the network acts as a spatial prior that allows generalization at test time to
match real images across variations in appearance, viewpoint and articulation.
On the CUB-200-2011 dataset of bird categories, we improve the AP over an
appearance-only network by 13.6%. We further demonstrate that our WarpNet
matches, together with the structure of fine-grained datasets, allow
single-view reconstructions with quality comparable to using annotated point
correspondences.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of a participatory decision-making process where a
shared priority list of alternatives has to be obtained while avoiding
inconsistent decisions. An agent-based model (ABM) is proposed to mimic this
process in different social networks of stakeholders who interact according to
an opinion dynamics model. Simulations' results show the efficacy of
interaction in finding a transitive and, above all, shared decision. These
findings are in agreement with real participation experiences regarding
transport planning decisions and can give useful suggestions on how to plan an
effective participation process for sustainable policy-making based on opinion
consensus.

 <dc:description>  Ad exchanges are becoming an increasingly popular way to sell advertisement
slots on the internet. An ad exchange is basically a spot market for ad
impressions. A publisher who has already signed contracts reserving
advertisement impressions on his pages can choose between assigning a new ad
impression for a new page view to a contracted advertiser or to sell it at an
ad exchange. This leads to an online revenue maximization problem for the
publisher. Given a new impression to sell decide whether (a) to assign it to a
contracted advertiser and if so to which one or (b) to sell it at the ad
exchange and if so at which reserve price. We make no assumptions about the
distribution of the advertiser valuations that participate in the ad exchange
and show that there exists a simple primal-dual based online algorithm, whose
lower bound for the revenue converges to $R_{ADX} + R_A (1 - 1/e)$, where
$R_{ADX}$ is the revenue that the optimum algorithm achieves from the ad
exchange and $R_A$ is the revenue that the optimum algorithm achieves from the
contracted advertisers.

 <dc:description>  We studied the feasibility of recognizing individual right whales (Eubalaena
glacialis) using convolutional neural networks. Prior studies have shown that
CNNs can be used in wide range of classification and categorization tasks such
as automated human face recognition. To test applicability of deep learning to
whale recognition we have developed several models based on best practices from
literature. Here, we describe the performance of the models. We conclude that
machine recognition of whales is feasible and comment on the difficulty of the
problem

 <dc:title>Approximation Algorithms for the Maximum Carpool Matching Problem</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kutiel, Gilad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Maximum Carpool Matching problem is a star packing problem in directed
graphs. Formally, given a directed graph $G = (V, A)$, a capacity function $ c:
V \to N $, and a weight function $w : A \to R $, a feasible \emph{carpool
matching} is a triple $(P, D, M)$, where $P$ (passengers) and $D$ (drivers)
form a partition of $V$, and $M$ is a subset of $A \cap (P \times D)$, under
the constraints that for every vertex $d \in D$, $din(d) \leq c(d)$, and for
every vertex $p \in P$, $dout(p) \leq 1$. In the Maximum Carpool Matching
problem we seek for a matching $(P, D, M)$ that maximizes the total weight of
$M$.
  The problem arises when designing an online carpool service, such as
Zimride~\cite{zimride}, that tries to connect between passengers and drivers
based on (arbitrary) similarity function. The problem is known to be NP-hard,
even for uniform weights and without capacity constraints.
  We present a $3$-approximation algorithm for the problem and
$2$-approximation algorithm for the unweighted variant of the problem.

 <dc:description>  With the severe spectrum shortage in conventional cellular bands,
millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies have been attracting growing attention for
next-generation micro- and picocellular wireless networks. A fundamental and
open question is whether mmWave cellular networks are likely to be noise- or
interference-limited. Identifying in which regime a network is operating is
critical for the design of MAC and physical-layer procedures and to provide
insights on how transmissions across cells should be coordinated to cope with
interference. This work uses the latest measurement-based statistical channel
models to accurately assess the Interference-to-Noise Ratio (INR) in a wide
range of deployment scenarios. In addition to cell density, we also study
antenna array size and antenna patterns, whose effects are critical in the
mmWave regime. The channel models also account for blockage, line-of-sight and
non-line-of-sight regimes as well as local scattering, that significantly
affect the level of spatial isolation.

 <dc:description>  The millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies are likely to play a significant
role in fifth-generation (5G) cellular systems. A key challenge in developing
systems in these bands is the potential for rapid channel dynamics: since
mmWave signals are blocked by many materials, small changes in the position or
orientation of the handset relative to objects in the environment can cause
large swings in the channel quality. This paper addresses the issue of tracking
the signal to noise ratio (SNR), which is an essential procedure for rate
prediction, handover and radio link failure detection. A simple method for
estimating the SNR from periodic synchronization signals is considered. The
method is then evaluated using real experiments in common blockage scenarios
combined with outdoor statistical models.

 <dc:description>  Human action recognition from well-segmented 3D skeleton data has been
intensively studied and has been attracting an increasing attention. Online
action detection goes one step further and is more challenging, which
identifies the action type and localizes the action positions on the fly from
the untrimmed stream data. In this paper, we study the problem of online action
detection from streaming skeleton data. We propose a multi-task end-to-end
Joint Classification-Regression Recurrent Neural Network to better explore the
action type and temporal localization information. By employing a joint
classification and regression optimization objective, this network is capable
of automatically localizing the start and end points of actions more
accurately. Specifically, by leveraging the merits of the deep Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) subnetwork, the proposed model automatically captures the complex
long-range temporal dynamics, which naturally avoids the typical sliding window
design and thus ensures high computational efficiency. Furthermore, the subtask
of regression optimization provides the ability to forecast the action prior to
its occurrence. To evaluate our proposed model, we build a large streaming
video dataset with annotations. Experimental results on our dataset and the
public G3D dataset both demonstrate very promising performance of our scheme.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The fixed parameter tractable (FPT) approach is a powerful tool in tackling
computationally hard problems. In this paper we link FPT results to classic
artificial intelligence techniques to show how they complement each other.
Specifically, we consider the workflow satisfiability problem (WSP) which asks
whether there exists an assignment of authorised users to the steps in a
workflow specification, subject to certain constraints on the assignment. It
was shown that WSP restricted to the class of user-independent constraints
(UI), covering many practical cases, admits FPT algorithms.
  We show that the FPT nature of WSP with UI constraints decomposes the problem
into two levels, and exploit this in a new FPT algorithm that is by many orders
of magnitude faster then the previous state-of-the-art WSP algorithm.
  The WSP with UI constraints can also be viewed as an extension of the
hypergraph list colouring problem. Inspired by a classic graph colouring method
called Zykov's Contraction, we designed a new pseudo-boolean (PB) formulation
of WSP with UI constraints that also exploits the two-level split of the
problem. Our experiments showed that, in many cases, this formulation being
solved with a general purpose PB solver demonstrated performance comparable to
that of our bespoke FPT algorithm. This raises the potential of using general
purpose solvers to tackle FPT problems efficiently.
  We also study the practical, average-case, performance of various algorithms.
To support this we extend studies of phase transition phenomena in the
understanding of the average computational effort needed to solve decision
problems. We investigate, for the first time, the phase transition properties
of the WSP, under a model for generation of random instances, and note that the
methods of the phase transition study need to be adjusted to FPT problems.

 <dc:title>Achieving Super-Resolution in Multi-Rate Sampling Systems via Efficient

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Super-resolution theory aims to estimate the discrete components lying in a
continuous space that constitute a sparse signal with optimal precision. This
work investigates the potential of recent super-resolution techniques for
spectral estimation in multi-rate sampling systems. It shows that, under the
existence of a common supporting grid, and under a minimal separation
constraint, the frequencies of a spectrally sparse signal can be exactly
jointly recovered from the output of a semidefinite program (SDP). The
algorithmic complexity of this approach is discussed, and an equivalent SDP of
minimal dimension is derived by extending the Gram parametrization properties
of sparse trigonometric polynomials.

 <dc:description>  Integrated Task and Motion Planning (ITMP) for mobile robots in a dynamic
environment with moving obstacles is a challenging research question and
attracts more and more attentions recently. Most existing methods either
restrict to static environments or lack performance guarantees. This motivates
us to investigate the ITMP problem using formal methods and propose a bottom-up
compositional design approach called CoSMoP (Composition of Safe Motion
Primitives). Our basic idea is to synthesize a global motion plan through
composing simple local moves and actions, and to achieve its performance
guarantee through modular and incremental verifications. The design consists of
two steps. First, basic motion primitives are designed and verified locally.
Then, a global motion path is built upon these certified motion primitives by
concatenating them together. In particular, we model the motion primitives as
hybrid automata and verify their safety through formulating as Differential
Dynamic Logic (d$\mathcal{L}$). Furthermore, these proven safe motion
primitives are composed based on an encoding to Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT) that takes into account the geometric constraints. Since d$\mathcal{L}$
allows compositional verification, the sequential composition of the safe
motion primitives also preserves safety properties. Therefore, the CoSMoP
generates correct plans for given task specifications that are formally proven
safe even for moving obstacles. Illustrative examples are presented to show the
effectiveness of the methods.

 <dc:description>  In one-way quantum computation (1WQC) model, universal quantum computations
are performed using measurements to designated qubits in a highly entangled
state. The choices of bases for these measurements as well as the structure of
the entanglements specify a quantum algorithm. As scalable and reliable quantum
computers have not been implemented yet, quantum computation simulators are the
only widely available tools to design and test quantum algorithms. However,
simulating the quantum computations on a standard classical computer in most
cases requires exponential memory and time. In this paper, a general direct
simulator for 1WQC, called OWQS, is presented. Some techniques such as qubit
elimination, pattern reordering and implicit simulation of actions are used to
considerably reduce the time and memory needed for the simulations. Moreover,
our simulator is adjusted to simulate the measurement patterns with a
generalized flow without calculating the measurement probabilities which is
called extended one-way quantum computation simulator (EOWQS). Experimental
results validate the feasibility of the proposed simulators and that OWQS and
EOWQS are faster as compared with the well-known quantum circuit simulators,
i.e., QuIDDPro and libquantum for simulating 1WQC model.

 <dc:title>Three-input Majority Function as the Unique Optimal Function for the
  Bias Amplification using Nonlocal Boxes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mori, Ryuhei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Brassard et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 250401 (2006)] showed that shared
nonlocal boxes with the CHSH probability greater than $\frac{3+\sqrt{6}}6$
yields trivial communication complexity. There still exists the gap with the
maximum CHSH probability $\frac{2+\sqrt{2}}4$ achievable by quantum mechanics.
It is an interesting open question to determine the exact threshold for the
trivial communication complexity. Brassard et al.'s idea is based on the
recursive bias amplification by the 3-input majority function. It was not
obvious if other choice of function exhibits stronger bias amplification. We
show that the 3-input majority function is the unique optimal, so that one
cannot improve the threshold $\frac{3+\sqrt{6}}6$ by Brassard et al.'s bias
amplification. In this work, protocols for computing the function used for the
bias amplification are restricted to be non-adaptive protocols or particular
adaptive protocol inspired by Paw{\l}owski et al.'s protocol for information
causality [Nature 461, 1101 (2009)]. We first show a new adaptive protocol
inspired by Paw{\l}owski et al.'s protocol, and then show that the new adaptive
protocol is better than any non-adaptive protocol. Finally, we show that the
3-input majority function is the unique optimal for the bias amplification if
we apply the new adaptive protocol to each step of the bias amplification.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the problem of obtaining $1$-of-$2$ string oblivious
transfer (OT) between users Alice and Bob, in the presence of a passive
eavesdropper Eve. The resource enabling OT in our setup is a noisy broadcast
channel from Alice to Bob and Eve. Apart from the OT requirements between the
users, Eve is not allowed to learn anything about the users' inputs. When Alice
and Bob are honest-but-curious and the noisy broadcast channel is made up of
two independent binary erasure channels (connecting Alice-Bob and Alice-Eve),
we derive the $1$-of-$2$ string OT capacity for both $2$-privacy (when Eve can
collude with either Alice or Bob) and $1$-privacy (when no such collusion is
allowed). We generalize these capacity results to $1$-of-$N$ string OT and
study other variants of this problem. When Alice and/or Bob are malicious, we
present a different scheme based on interactive hashing. This scheme is shown
to be optimal for certain parameter regimes. We present a new formulation of
multiple, simultaneous OTs between Alice-Bob and Alice-Cathy. For this new
setup, we present schemes and outer bounds that match in all but one regime of
parameters. Finally, we consider the setup where the broadcast channel is made
up of a cascade of two independent binary erasure channels (connecting
Alice-Bob and Bob-Eve) and $1$-of-$2$ string OT is desired between Alice and
Bob with $1$-privacy. For this setup, we derive an upper and lower bound on the
$1$-of-$2$ string OT capacity which match in one of two possible parameter
regimes.

 <dc:description>  We present an overview of current academic curricula for Scientific
Computing, High-Performance Computing and Data Science. After a survey of
current academic and non-academic programs across the globe, we focus on
Canadian programs and specifically on the education program of the SciNet HPC
Consortium, using its detailed enrollment and course statistics for the past
four to five years. Not only do these data display a steady and rapid increase
in the demand for research-computing instruction, they also show a clear shift
from traditional (high performance) computing to data-oriented methods. It is
argued that this growing demand warrants specialized research computing
degrees. The possible curricula of such degrees are described next, taking
existing programs as an example, and adding SciNet's experiences of student
desires as well as trends in advanced research computing.

 <dc:description>  Chemical reactions are a prominent feature of molecular systems, with no
direct parallels in wireless communications. While chemical reactions may be
used inside the transmitter nodes, receiver nodes or the communication medium,
we focus on its utility in the medium in this paper. Such chemical reactions
can be used to perform computation over the medium as molecules diffuse and
react with each other (physical-layer computation). We propose the use of
chemical reactions for the following purposes: (i) to realize molecular
physical-layer network coding (molecular PNC) by performing the natural XOR
operation inside the medium, and (ii) to reduce signal-dependent observation
noise of molecular receptors by canceling out the remaining molecules from
previous transmission. To make the ideas formal, we consider an explicit
two-way relaying example with a ligand receiver (which has a signal-dependent
noise). The proposed ideas are used to define a modulation scheme (which we
call the PNC scheme). We compare the PNC with a previously proposed scheme for
this problem where the XOR operation is performed at the relay node (using a
molecular logic gate). We call the latter, the straightforward network coding
(SNC). It is observed that in addition to the simplicity of the proposed PNC
scheme, it outperforms the SNC scheme especially when we consider inter-symbol
interference (ISI).

 <dc:description>  Full charge capacity (FCC) refers to the amount of energy a battery can hold.
It is the fundamental property of smartphone batteries that diminishes as the
battery ages and is charged/discharged. We investigate the behavior of
smartphone batteries while charging and demonstrate that the battery voltage
and charging rate information can together characterize the FCC of a battery.
We propose a new method for accurately estimating FCC without exposing
low-level system details or introducing new hardware or system modules. We also
propose and implement a collaborative FCC estimation technique that builds on
crowdsourced battery data. The method finds the reference voltage curve and
charging rate of a particular smartphone model from the data and then compares
the curve and rate of an individual user with the model reference curve. After
analyzing a large data set, we report that 55% of all devices and at least one
device in 330 out of 357 unique device models lost some of their FCC. For some
models, the median capacity loss exceeded 20% with the inter-quartile range
being over 20 pp. The models enable debugging the performance of smartphone
batteries, more accurate power modeling, and energy-aware system or application
optimization.

 <dc:description>  Two important requirements when aggregating the preferences of multiple
agents are that the outcome should be economically efficient and the
aggregation mechanism should not be manipulable. In this paper, we provide a
computer-aided proof of a sweeping impossibility using these two conditions for
randomized aggregation mechanisms. More precisely, we show that every efficient
aggregation mechanism can be manipulated for all expected utility
representations of the agents' preferences. This settles an open problem and
strengthens a number of existing theorems, including statements that were shown
within the special domain of assignment. Our proof is obtained by formulating
the claim as a satisfiability problem over predicates from real-valued
arithmetic, which is then checked using an SMT (satisfiability modulo theories)
solver. In order to verify the correctness of the result, a minimal
unsatisfiable set of constraints returned by the SMT solver was translated back
into a proof in higher-order logic, which was automatically verified by an
interactive theorem prover. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
application of SMT solvers in computational social choice.

 <dc:description>  Carrier aggregation, which allows users to aggregate several component
carriers to obtain up to 100 MHz of band- width, is one of the central features
envisioned for next generation cellular networks. While this feature will
enable support for higher data rates and improve quality of service, it may
also be employed as an effective interference mitigation technique, especially
in multi-tier heterogeneous networks. Having in mind that the aggregated
component carriers may belong to different frequency bands and, hence, have
varying propagation profiles, we argue that it is not necessary, indeed even
harmful, to transmit at maximum power at all carriers, at all times. Rather, by
using game theory, we design a distributed algorithm that lets eNodeBs and
micro base stations dynamically adjust the downlink transmit power for the
different component carriers. We compare our scheme to different power
strategies combined with popular interference mitigation techniques, in a
typical large-scale scenario, and show that our solution significantly
outperforms the other strategies in terms of global network utility, power
consumption and user throughput.

 <dc:description>  Corpus Pattern Analysis (CPA) has been the topic of Semeval 2015 Task 15,
aimed at producing a system that can aid lexicographers in their efforts to
build a dictionary of meanings for English verbs using the CPA annotation
process. CPA parsing is one of the subtasks which this annotation process is
made of and it is the focus of this report. A supervised machine-learning
approach has been implemented, in which syntactic features derived from parse
trees and semantic features derived from WordNet and word embeddings are used.
It is shown that this approach performs well, even with the data sparsity
issues that characterize the dataset, and can obtain better results than other
system by a margin of about 4% f-score.

 <dc:title>Sleeping Beauties Cited in Patents: Is there also a Dormitory of
  Inventions?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>van Raan, Anthony F. J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A Sleeping Beauty in Science is a publication that goes unnoticed (sleeps)
for a long time and then, almost suddenly, attracts a lot of attention (is
awakened by a prince). In our foregoing study we found that roughly half of the
Sleeping Beauties are application-oriented and thus are potential Sleeping
Innovations. In this paper we investigate a new topic: Sleeping Beauties that
are cited in patents. In this way we explore the existence of a dormitory of
inventions. We find that patent citation may occur before or after the
awakening and that the depth of the sleep, i.e., citation rate during the
sleeping period, is no predictor for later scientific or technological impact
of the Sleeping Beauty. Inventor-author self-citations occur only in a small
minority of the Sleeping Beauties that are cited in patents, but other types of
inventor-author links occur more frequently. We analyze whether they deal with
new topics by measuring the time-dependent evolution in the entire scientific
literature of the number of papers related to both the precisely defined topics
as well as the broader research theme of the Sleeping Beauty during and after
the sleeping time. We focus on the awakening by analyzing the first group of
papers that cites the Sleeping Beauty. Next, we create concept maps of the
topic-related and the citing papers for a time period immediately following the
awakening and for the most recent period. Finally, we make an extensive
assessment of the cited and citing relations of the Sleeping Beauty. We find
that tunable co-citation analysis is a powerful tool to discover the prince and
other important application-oriented work directly related to the Sleeping
Beauty, for instance papers written by authors who cite Sleeping Beauties in
both the patents of which they are the inventors, as well as in their
scientific papers.

 <dc:description>  High-dimensional sparse data present computational and statistical challenges
for supervised learning. We propose compact linear sketches for reducing the
dimensionality of the input, followed by a single layer neural network. We show
that any sparse polynomial function can be computed, on nearly all sparse
binary vectors, by a single layer neural network that takes a compact sketch of
the vector as input. Consequently, when a set of sparse binary vectors is
approximately separable using a sparse polynomial, there exists a single-layer
neural network that takes a short sketch as input and correctly classifies
nearly all the points. Previous work has proposed using sketches to reduce
dimensionality while preserving the hypothesis class. However, the sketch size
has an exponential dependence on the degree in the case of polynomial
classifiers. In stark contrast, our approach of using improper learning, using
a larger hypothesis class allows the sketch size to have a logarithmic
dependence on the degree. Even in the linear case, our approach allows us to
improve on the pesky $O({1}/{{\gamma}^2})$ dependence of random projections, on
the margin $\gamma$. We empirically show that our approach leads to more
compact neural networks than related methods such as feature hashing at equal
or better performance.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>H.3.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Document retrieval has been an important research problem over many years in
the information retrieval community. State-of-the-art techniques utilize
various methods in matching documents to a given document including keywords,
phrases, and annotations. In this paper, we propose a new approach for document
retrieval that utilizes predications (subject-predicate-object triples)
extracted from the documents. We represent documents as sets of predications.
We measure the similarity between predications to compute the similarity
between documents. Our approach utilizes the hierarchical information available
in ontologies in computing concept-concept similarity, making the approach
flexible. Predication-based document similarity is more precise and forms the
basis for a semantically aware document retrieval system. We show that the
approach is competitive with an existing state-of-the-art related document
retrieval technique in the biomedical domain.

 <dc:description>  We study a special kind of bounds (so called forbidden subgraph bounds, cf.
Feige, Verbitsky '02) for parallel repetition of multi-prover games.
  First, we show that forbidden subgraph upper bounds for $r \ge 3$ provers
imply the same bounds for the density Hales-Jewett theorem for alphabet of size
$r$. As a consequence, this yields a new family of games with slow decrease in
the parallel repetition value.
  Second, we introduce a new technique for proving exponential forbidden
subgraph upper bounds and explore its power and limitations. In particular, we
obtain exponential upper bounds for two-prover games with question graphs of
treewidth at most two and show that our method cannot give exponential bounds
for all two-prover graphs.

 <dc:description>  We present two deterministic dynamic algorithms for the maximum matching
problem. (1) An algorithm that maintains a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximate maximum
matching in general graphs with $O(\text{poly}(\log n, 1/\epsilon))$ update
time. (2) An algorithm that maintains an $\alpha_K$ approximation of the {\em
value} of the maximum matching with $O(n^{2/K})$ update time in bipartite
graphs, for every sufficiently large constant positive integer $K$. Here,
$1\leq \alpha_K &lt; 2$ is a constant determined by the value of $K$. Result (1)
is the first deterministic algorithm that can maintain an $o(\log
n)$-approximate maximum matching with polylogarithmic update time, improving
the seminal result of Onak et al. [STOC 2010]. Its approximation guarantee
almost matches the guarantee of the best {\em randomized} polylogarithmic
update time algorithm [Baswana et al. FOCS 2011]. Result (2) achieves a
better-than-two approximation with {\em arbitrarily small polynomial} update
time on bipartite graphs. Previously the best update time for this problem was
$O(m^{1/4})$ [Bernstein et al. ICALP 2015], where $m$ is the current number of
edges in the graph.

 <dc:description>  The status quo approach to training object detectors requires expensive
bounding box annotations. Our framework takes a markedly different direction:
we transfer tracked object boxes from weakly-labeled videos to weakly-labeled
images to automatically generate pseudo ground-truth boxes, which replace
manually annotated bounding boxes. We first mine discriminative regions in the
weakly-labeled image collection that frequently/rarely appear in the
positive/negative images. We then match those regions to videos and retrieve
the corresponding tracked object boxes. Finally, we design a hough transform
algorithm to vote for the best box to serve as the pseudo GT for each image,
and use them to train an object detector. Together, these lead to
state-of-the-art weakly-supervised detection results on the PASCAL 2007 and
2010 datasets.

 <dc:description>  Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets) are introduced by the 3GPP as an emerging
technology to provide high network coverage and capacity. The HetNets are the
combination of multilayer networks such as macrocell, small cell (picocell and
femtocell) networks. In such networks, users may suffer significant cross-layer
interference. To manage the interference the 3GPP has introduced Enhanced
Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (eICIC) techniques, Almost Blank SubFrame
(ABSF) is one of the time-domain technique in the eICIC solutions. In this
thesis, we propose a dynamically optimal ABSF framework to enhance the small
cell user downlink performance while maintains the macro user downlink
performance. We also study the mechanism to help the small cell base stations
cooperate efficiently in order to reduce the mutual interference. Via numerical
results, our proposed scheme achieves a significant performance and outperforms
the existing ABSF frameworks in terms of user throughput and outage
probability.

 <dc:description>  In this article we describe how to find the parameters of subfield subcodes
of extended Norm--Trace codes. With a Gr\&quot;obner basis of the ideal of the
$\mathbb{F}_{q^r}$ rational points of the Norm--Trace curve one can determine
the dimension of the subfield subcodes or the dimension of the trace code. We
also find a BCH--like bound from the minimum distance of the original
supercode.

 <dc:description>  Identifying and communicating relationships between causes and effects is
important for understanding our world, but is affected by language structure,
cognitive and emotional biases, and the properties of the communication medium.
Despite the increasing importance of social media, much remains unknown about
causal statements made online. To study real-world causal attribution, we
extract a large-scale corpus of causal statements made on the Twitter social
network platform as well as a comparable random control corpus. We compare
causal and control statements using statistical language and sentiment analysis
tools. We find that causal statements have a number of significant lexical and
grammatical differences compared with controls and tend to be more negative in
sentiment than controls. Causal statements made online tend to focus on news
and current events, medicine and health, or interpersonal relationships, as
shown by topic models. By quantifying the features and potential biases of
causality communication, this study improves our understanding of the accuracy
of information and opinions found online.

 <dc:description>  The robot soccer game based complex motion control has been widely studied
for the moving object capture and shooting. A position prediction algorithm
based on global vision is introduced in order to improve the accuracy and
robustness of the vision system for tracking moving objects, including a
Kalmanfiter, a dynamic window and an obstacle avoidance strategy. This paper
deals with the positon prediction for moving ball by using Kalmanfiter and the
Fuzzy Controller for shooting action in a dynamic environment.

for First Person Shooter (FPS) games. A multi-agent evolutionary system is
employed to place streets, buildings and other items inside the Unity3D game
engine, resulting in playable video game levels. A computational agent is
trained using machine learning techniques to capture the intent of the game
designer as part of the multi-agent system, and to enable a semi-automated
aesthetic selection for the underlying genetic algorithm.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Modern films, games and virtual reality applications are dependent on
convincing computer graphics. Highly complex models are a requirement for the
successful delivery of many scenes and environments. While workflows such as
rendering, compositing and animation have been streamlined to accommodate
increasing demands, modelling complex models is still a laborious task. This
paper introduces the computational benefits of an Interactive Genetic Algorithm
(IGA) to computer graphics modelling while compensating the effects of user
fatigue, a common issue with Interactive Evolutionary Computation. An
intelligent agent is used in conjunction with an IGA that offers the potential
to reduce the effects of user fatigue by learning from the choices made by the
human designer and directing the search accordingly. This workflow accelerates
the layout and distribution of basic elements to form complex models. It
captures the designer's intent through interaction, and encourages playful
discovery.

 <dc:title>Reinventing the Arcade: Computer Game Mediated Play Spaces for Physical

 <dc:creator>Gavin, Jenna</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper suggests that recent developments in video game technology have
occurred in parallel to play being moved from public into private spaces, which
has had impact on the way people interact with games. The paper also argues and
that there is potentially value in the creation of public play spaces to create
opportunities to utilise both technology and body for the benefit of community
culture and experiences through gaming. Co-located social gaming coupled with
tangible interfaces offer alternative possibilities for the local video game
scene. This paper includes a descriptive account of Rabble Room Arcade, an
experimental social event combining custom-built tangible interface devices and
multiplayer video games. The event was designed around games that promoted a
return to simplicity through the use of unique tangible controllers to allow
casual gamers to connect to the game and to each other, whilst also
transforming the event into a spectacle.

 <dc:description>  The range of video annotation software currently available is set within
commercially specialized professions, distributed via outdated sources or
through online video hosting services. As video content becomes an increasingly
significant tool for analysis, there is a demand for appropriate digital
annotation techniques that offer equivalent functionality to tools used for
annotation of text based literature sources. This paper argues for the
importance of video annotating as an effective method for research that is as
accessible as literature annotation is. Video annotation has been shown to
trigger higher learning and engagement but research struggles to explain the
absence of video annotation in contemporary structures of education practice.
In both academic and informal settings the use of video playback as a
meaningful tool of analysis is apparent, yet the availability of supplementary
annotation software is not within obvious grasp or even prevalent in
standardized computer software. Practical software tools produced by the
researcher have demonstrated effective video annotation in a short development
time. With software design programs available for rapid application creation,
this paper also highlights the absence of a development community. This paper
argues that video annotation is an accessible tool, not just for academic
contexts, but also for wider practical video analysis applications, potentially
becoming a mainstream learning tool. This paper thus presents a practical
multimodal public approach to video research that potentially affords a deeper
analysis of media content. This is supported by an in-depth consideration of
the motivation for undertaking video annotation and a critical analysis of
currently available tools.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Existing approaches for Chinese zero pronoun resolution overlook semantic
information. This is because zero pronouns have no descriptive information,
which results in difficulty in explicitly capturing their semantic similarities
with antecedents. Moreover, when dealing with candidate antecedents,
traditional systems simply take advantage of the local information of a single
candidate antecedent while failing to consider the underlying information
provided by the other candidates from a global perspective. To address these
weaknesses, we propose a novel zero pronoun-specific neural network, which is
capable of representing zero pronouns by utilizing the contextual information
at the semantic level. In addition, when dealing with candidate antecedents, a
two-level candidate encoder is employed to explicitly capture both the local
and global information of candidate antecedents. We conduct experiments on the
Chinese portion of the OntoNotes 5.0 corpus. Experimental results show that our
approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art method in various
experimental settings.

 <dc:title>Design and Analysis of Dynamic Auto Scaling Algorithm (DASA) for 5G

 <dc:description>  Network Function Virtualization (NFV) enables mobile operators to virtualize
their network entities as Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs), offering
fine-grained on-demand network capabilities. VNFs can be dynamically
scale-in/out to meet the performance requirements for future 5G networks.
However, designing an auto-scaling algorithm with low operation cost and low
latency while considering the capacity of legacy network equipment is a
challenge. In this paper, we propose a VNF Dynamic Auto Scaling Algorithm
(DASA) considering the tradeoff between performance and operation cost. We also
develop an analytical model to quantify the tradeoff and validate the analysis
through extensive simulations. The system is modeled as a queueing model while
legacy network equipment is considered as a reserved block of servers. The VNF
instances are powered on and off according to the number of job requests. The
results show that the proposed DASA can significantly reduce operation cost
given the latency upper-bound. Moreover, the models provide a quick way to
evaluate the cost-performance tradeoff without wide deployment, which can save
cost and time.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the first reliable physical-layer network coding (PNC)
system that supports real TCP/IP applications for the two-way relay network
(TWRN). Theoretically, PNC could boost the throughput of TWRN by a factor of 2
compared with traditional scheduling (TS) in the high signal-to-noise (SNR)
regime. Although there have been many theoretical studies on PNC performance,
there have been relatively few experimental and implementation efforts. Our
earlier PNC prototype, built in 2012, was an offline system that processed
signals offline. For a system that supports real applications, signals must be
processed online in real-time. Our real-time reliable PNC prototype, referred
to as RPNC, solves a number of key challenges to enable the support of real
TCP/IP applications. The enabling components include: 1) a time-slotted system
that achieves us-level synchronization for the PNC system; 2) reduction of PNC
signal processing complexity to meet real-time constraints; 3) an ARQ design
tailored for PNC to ensure reliable packet delivery; 4) an interface to the
application layer. We took on the challenge to implement all the above with
general-purpose processors in PC through an SDR platform rather than ASIC or
FPGA. With all these components, we have successfully demonstrated image
exchange with TCP and twoparty video conferencing with UDP over RPNC.
Experimental results show that the achieved throughput approaches the PHYlayer
data rate at high SNR, demonstrating the high efficiency of the RPNC system.

 <dc:description>  Building successful recommender systems requires uncovering the underlying
dimensions that describe the properties of items as well as users' preferences
toward them. In domains like clothing recommendation, explaining users'
preferences requires modeling the visual appearance of the items in question.
This makes recommendation especially challenging, due to both the complexity
and subtlety of people's 'visual preferences,' as well as the scale and
dimensionality of the data and features involved. Ultimately, a successful
model should be capable of capturing considerable variance across different
categories and styles, while still modeling the commonalities explained by
`global' structures in order to combat the sparsity (e.g. cold-start),
variability, and scale of real-world datasets. Here, we address these
challenges by building such structures to model the visual dimensions across
different product categories. With a novel hierarchical embedding architecture,
our method accounts for both high-level (colorfulness, darkness, etc.) and
subtle (e.g. casualness) visual characteristics simultaneously.

$t_k=6.03+O(k^{-1})$ when $k$ tends to infinity. Our result generalizes the

 <dc:title>Deep CNNs for HEp-2 Cells Classification : A Cross-specimen Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Ruixi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Automatic classification of Human Epithelial Type-2 (HEp-2) cells staining
patterns is an important and yet a challenging problem. Although both shallow
and deep methods have been applied, the study of deep convolutional networks
(CNNs) on this topic is shallow to date, thus failed to claim its top position
for this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel study of using CNNs for
HEp-2 cells classification focusing on cross-specimen analysis, a key
evaluation for generalization. For the first time, our study reveals several
key factors of using CNNs for HEp-2 cells classification. Our proposed system
achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy on public benchmark dataset.
Comparative experiments on different training data reveals that adding
different specimens,rather than increasing in numbers by affine
transformations, helps to train a good deep model. This opens a new avenue for
adopting deep CNNs to HEp-2 cells classification.

 <dc:title>Depth Image Inpainting: Improving Low Rank Matrix Completion with Low

 <dc:description>  We consider the case of inpainting single depth images. Without corresponding
color images, previous or next frames, depth image inpainting is quite
challenging. One natural solution is to regard the image as a matrix and adopt
the low rank regularization just as inpainting color images. However, the low
rank assumption does not make full use of the properties of depth images.
  A shallow observation may inspire us to penalize the non-zero gradients by
sparse gradient regularization. However, statistics show that though most
pixels have zero gradients, there is still a non-ignorable part of pixels whose
gradients are equal to 1. Based on this specific property of depth images , we
propose a low gradient regularization method in which we reduce the penalty for
gradient 1 while penalizing the non-zero gradients to allow for gradual depth
changes. The proposed low gradient regularization is integrated with the low
rank regularization into the low rank low gradient approach for depth image
inpainting. We compare our proposed low gradient regularization with sparse
gradient regularization. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

 <dc:title>Trading-Off Cost of Deployment Versus Accuracy in Learning Predictive

 <dc:description>  Predictive models are finding an increasing number of applications in many
industries. As a result, a practical means for trading-off the cost of
deploying a model versus its effectiveness is needed. Our work is motivated by
risk prediction problems in healthcare. Cost-structures in domains such as
healthcare are quite complex, posing a significant challenge to existing
approaches. We propose a novel framework for designing cost-sensitive
structured regularizers that is suitable for problems with complex cost
dependencies. We draw upon a surprising connection to boolean circuits. In
particular, we represent the problem costs as a multi-layer boolean circuit,
and then use properties of boolean circuits to define an extended feature
vector and a group regularizer that exactly captures the underlying cost
structure. The resulting regularizer may then be combined with a fidelity
function to perform model prediction, for example. For the challenging
real-world application of risk prediction for sepsis in intensive care units,
the use of our regularizer leads to models that are in harmony with the
underlying cost structure and thus provide an excellent prediction accuracy
versus cost tradeoff.

 <dc:description>  Heterogenous wireless networks (Hetnets) provide a powerful approach to meet
the massive growth in traffic demands, but also impose a significant challenge
on backhaul. Caching at small base stations (BSs) and wireless small cell
backhaul have been proposed as attractive solutions to address this new
challenge. In this paper, we consider the optimal caching and user association
to minimize the total time to satisfy the average demands in cached-enabled
Hetnets with wireless backhaul. We formulate this problem as a mixed
discrete-continuous optimization for given bandwidth and cache resources.
First, we characterize the structure of the optimal solution. Specifically, we
show that the optimal caching is to store the most popular files at each pico
BS, and the optimal user association has a threshold form. We also obtain the
closed-form optimal solution in the homogenous scenario of pico cells. Then, we
analyze the impact of bandwidth and cache resources on the minimum total time
to satisfy the average demands. Finally, using numerical simulations, we verify
the analytical results.

 <dc:title>Liveness-Based Garbage Collection for Lazy Languages</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of reducing the memory required to run lazy
first-order functional programs. Our approach is to analyze programs for
liveness of heap-allocated data. The result of the analysis is used to preserve
only live data---a subset of reachable data---during garbage collection. The
result is an increase in the garbage reclaimed and a reduction in the peak
memory requirement of programs. While this technique has already been shown to
yield benefits for eager first-order languages, the lack of a statically
determinable execution order and the presence of closures pose new challenges
for lazy languages. These require changes both in the liveness analysis itself
and in the design of the garbage collector.
  To show the effectiveness of our method, we implemented a copying collector
that uses the results of the liveness analysis to preserve live objects, both
evaluated (i.e., in WHNF) and closures. Our experiments confirm that for
programs running with a liveness-based garbage collector, there is a
significant decrease in peak memory requirements. In addition, a sizable
reduction in the number of collections ensures that in spite of using a more
complex garbage collector, the execution times of programs running with
liveness and reachability-based collectors remain comparable.

 <dc:description>  It is shown that order-invariance of two-variable first-logic is decidable in
the finite. This is an immediate consequence of a decision procedure obtained
for the finite satisfiability problem for existential second-order logic with
two first-order variables ($\mathrm{ESO}^2$) on structures with two linear
orders and one induced successor. We also show that finite satisfiability is
decidable on structures with two successors and one induced linear order. In
both cases, so far only decidability for monadic $\mathrm{ESO}^2$ has been
known. In addition, the finite satisfiability problem for $\mathrm{ESO}^2$ on
structures with one linear order and its induced successor relation is shown to
be decidable in non-deterministic exponential time.

 <dc:description>  We adopt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to be our parametric model to
learn discriminative features and classifiers for local patch classification.
Based on the occurrence frequency distribution of classes, an ensemble of CNNs
(CNN-Ensemble) are learned, in which each CNN component focuses on learning
different and complementary visual patterns. The local beliefs of pixels are
output by CNN-Ensemble. Considering that visually similar pixels are
indistinguishable under local context, we leverage the global scene semantics
to alleviate the local ambiguity. The global scene constraint is mathematically
achieved by adding a global energy term to the labeling energy function, and it
is practically estimated in a non-parametric framework. A large margin based
CNN metric learning method is also proposed for better global belief
estimation. In the end, the integration of local and global beliefs gives rise
to the class likelihood of pixels, based on which maximum marginal inference is
performed to generate the label prediction maps. Even without any
post-processing, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the challenging
SiftFlow and Barcelona benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Estimation, recognition, and near-future prediction of 3D trajectories based
on their two dimensional projections available from one camera source is an
exceptionally difficult problem due to uncertainty in the trajectories and
environment, high dimensionality of the specific trajectory states, lack of
enough labeled data and so on. In this article, we propose a solution to solve
this problem based on a novel deep learning model dubbed Disjunctive Factored
Four-Way Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DFFW-CRBM). Our method
improves state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for high dimensional
time-series modeling by introducing a novel tensor factorization capable of
driving forth order Boltzmann machines to considerably lower energy levels, at
no computational costs. DFFW-CRBMs are capable of accurately estimating,
recognizing, and performing near-future prediction of three-dimensional
trajectories from their 2D projections while requiring limited amount of
labeled data. We evaluate our method on both simulated and real-world data,
showing its effectiveness in predicting and classifying complex ball
trajectories and human activities.

 <dc:description>  We present an algorithm for the optimization of a class of finite element
integration loop nests. This algorithm, which exploits fundamental mathematical
properties of finite element operators, is proven to achieve a locally optimal
operation count. In specified circumstances the optimum achieved is global.
Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate significant performance
improvements over the state of the art in finite element code generation in
almost all cases. This validates the effectiveness of the algorithm presented
here, and illustrates its limitations.

 <dc:description>  Entity disambiguation, or mapping a phrase to its canonical representation in
a knowledge base, is a fundamental step in many natural language processing
applications. Existing techniques based on global ranking models fail to
capture the individual peculiarities of the words and hence, either struggle to
meet the accuracy requirements of many real-world applications or they are too
complex to satisfy real-time constraints of applications.
  In this paper, we propose a new disambiguation system that learns specialized
features and models for disambiguating each ambiguous phrase in the English
language. To train and validate the hundreds of thousands of learning models
for this purpose, we use a Wikipedia hyperlink dataset with more than 170
million labelled annotations. We provide an extensive experimental evaluation
to show that the accuracy of our approach compares favourably with respect to
many state-of-the-art disambiguation systems. The training required for our
approach can be easily distributed over a cluster. Furthermore, updating our
system for new entities or calibrating it for special ones is a computationally
fast process, that does not affect the disambiguation of the other entities.

 <dc:description>  Embedding-based Knowledge Base Completion models have so far mostly combined
distributed representations of individual entities or relations to compute
truth scores of missing links. Facts can however also be represented using
pairwise embeddings, i.e. embeddings for pairs of entities and relations. In
this paper we explore such bigram embeddings with a flexible Factorization
Machine model and several ablations from it. We investigate the relevance of
various bigram types on the fb15k237 dataset and find relative improvements
compared to a compositional model.

 <dc:description>  The covariance matrix of measurements of Markov random fields (processes) has
useful properties that allow to develop effective computational algorithms for
many problems in the study of Markov fields on the basis of field observations
(parametric identification problems, filtering problems, interpolation problems
and others). Therefore, approximation of arbitrary random fields by Markov
fields is of great interest, as it gives an opportunity to use computationally
efficient algorithms of Markov fields analysis to study them. The paper deals
with approximation of the covariance matrix of the field being observed with
the help of covariance matrix of a multiply connected (m-connected) Markov
field. Using computer simulation, the accuracy of such replacements at
different values of the connectivity coefficient m for the problem of
parametric identification of deterministic component of the field has been
studied. Various models of deterministic polynomial component of the field and
a number of covariance functions that are often used as a mathematical model of
real random noise and measurements noise have been reviewed. It has been shown
that for many problems such approximation, even at small connectivity m values
of approximating Markov field, provides necessary accuracy. This allows to
achieve good compromise between accuracy of the estimates and complexity of
calculating them.

 <dc:description>  This work explores the feasibility of specialized hardware implementing the
Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA) in order to fully exploit its inherent
advantages. This algorithm, which is inspired in the current understanding of
the mammalian neo-cortex, is the basis of the Hierarchical Temporal Memory
(HTM). In contrast to other machine learning (ML) approaches, the structure is
not application dependent and relies on fully unsupervised continuous learning.
We hypothesize that a hardware implementation will be able not only to extend
the already practical uses of these ideas to broader scenarios but also to
exploit the hardware-friendly CLA characteristics. The architecture proposed
will enable an unfeasible scalability for software solutions and will fully
capitalize on one of the many CLA advantages: low computational requirements
and reduced storage utilization. Compared to a state-of-the-art CLA software
implementation it could be possible to improve by 4 orders of magnitude in
performance and up to 8 orders of magnitude in energy efficiency. We propose to
use a packet-switched network to tackle this. The paper addresses the
fundamental issues of such an approach, proposing solutions to achieve scalable
solutions. We will analyze cost and performance when using well-known
architecture techniques and tools. The results obtained suggest that even with
CMOS technology, under constrained cost, it might be possible to implement a
large-scale system. We found that the proposed solutions enable a saving of 90%
of the original communication costs running either synthetic or realistic
workloads.

for Soft- ware testing is not a new idea, many commercial tools like Silk Suite
[5] use them,while Selenese, the DSL for Selenium IDE [6] is open source. nJexl
is a functionally motivated, embeddable,Turing Complete [7] [8] language. It's
philosophy is to expose the existing Java echo system in a declarative fashion

 <dc:description>  Digital libraries store images which can be highly degraded and to index this
kind of images we resort to word spot- ting as our information retrieval
system. Information retrieval for handwritten document images is more
challenging due to the difficulties in complex layout analysis, large
variations of writing styles, and degradation or low quality of historical
manuscripts. This paper presents a simple innovative learning-free method for
word spotting from large scale historical documents combining Local Binary
Pattern (LBP) and spatial sampling. This method offers three advantages:
firstly, it operates in completely learning free paradigm which is very
different from unsupervised learning methods, secondly, the computational time
is significantly low because of the LBP features which are very fast to
compute, and thirdly, the method can be used in scenarios where annotations are
not available. Finally we compare the results of our proposed retrieval method
with the other methods in the literature.

 <dc:description>  Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems of current LTE releases are
capable of adaptation in the azimuth only. Recently, the trend is to enhance
system performance by exploiting the channel's degrees of freedom in the
elevation, which necessitates the characterization of 3D channels. We present
an information-theoretic channel model for MIMO systems that supports the
elevation dimension. The model is based on the principle of maximum entropy,
which enables us to determine the distribution of the channel matrix consistent
with the prior information on the angles. Based on this model, we provide
analytical expression for the cumulative density function (CDF) of the mutual
information (MI) for systems with a single receive and finite number of
transmit antennas in the general signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR)
regime. The result is extended to systems with finite receive antennas in the
low SINR regime. A Gaussian approximation to the asymptotic behavior of MI
distribution is derived for the large number of transmit antennas and paths
regime. We corroborate our analysis with simulations that study the performance
gains realizable through meticulous selection of the transmit antenna downtilt
angles, confirming the potential of elevation beamforming to enhance system
performance. The results are directly applicable to the analysis of 5G
3D-Massive MIMO-systems.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the exploration and mapping of anonymous graphs by a mobile
agent. It is long known that, without global information about the graph, it is
not possible to make the agent halt after the exploration except if the graph
is a tree. We therefore endow the agent with binoculars, a sensing device that
can show the local structure of the environment at a constant distance of the
agent's current location and investigate networks that can be efficiently
explored in this setting.
  In the case of trees, the exploration without binoculars is fast (i.e. using
a DFS traversal of the graph, there is a number of moves linear in the number
of nodes). We consider here the family of Weetman graphs that is a
generalization of the standard family of chordal graphs and present a new
deterministic algorithm that realizes Exploration of any Weetman graph, without
knowledge of size or diameter and for any port numbering. The number of moves
is linear in the number of nodes, despite the fact that Weetman graphs are not
sparse, some having a number of edges that is quadratic in the number of nodes.
  At the end of the Exploration, the agent has also computed a map of the
anonymous graph.

 <dc:description>  Image segmentation, the process of separating the elements within an image,
is frequently used for obtaining information from photomicrographs. However,
segmentation methods should be used with reservations: incorrect segmentation
can mislead when interpreting regions of interest (ROI), thus decreasing the
success rate of additional procedures. Multi-Level Starlet Segmentation (MLSS)
and Multi-Level Starlet Optimal Segmentation (MLSOS) were developed to address
the photomicrograph segmentation deficiency on general tools. These methods
gave rise to Jansen-MIDAS, an open-source software which a scientist can use to
obtain a multi-level threshold segmentation of his/hers photomicrographs. This
software is presented in two versions: a text-based version, for GNU Octave,
and a graphical user interface (GUI) version, for MathWorks MATLAB. It can be
used to process several types of images, becoming a reliable alternative to the
scientist.

 <dc:title>Reconstructing a website's lost past: Methodological issues concerning
  the history of www.unibo.it</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper describes how born digital primary sources could be used to
reconstruct the recent history of scientific institutions. The case study is an
analysis of the first 25 years online of the University of Bologna. The focus
of this work is primarily methodological: several different issues are
presented, starting with the fact that the University of Bologna website has
been excluded for thirteen years from the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine,
and possible solutions are proposed and applied. The article is organised in
three parts: in the first one, some of the fundamental concepts on web archives
and the preservation of born digital sources are introduced. Then the
reconstruction of the University of Bologna web's past is presented. Finally
the future of this research is described, presenting a specific case study in
which the historian's craft will be challenged by a completely different issue,
namely the large amount of data available in the university digital library.

 <dc:description>  The current strong divide between applications and the network control plane
is desirable for many reasons; but a downside is that the network is kept in
the dark regarding the ultimate purposes and intentions of applications and, as
a result, is unable to optimize for these. An alternative approach, explored in
this paper, is for applications to declare to the network their abstract
intents and assumptions; e.g. &quot;this is a Tweet&quot;, or &quot;this application will run
within a local domain&quot;. Such an enriched semantic has the potential to enable
the network better to fulfill application intent, while also helping optimize
network resource usage across applications. We refer to this approach as
'intent driven networking' (IDN), and we sketch an incrementally-deployable
design to serve as a stepping stone towards a practical realization of the IDN
concept within today's Internet.

 <dc:title>Parametric Object Motion from Blur</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Motion blur can adversely affect a number of vision tasks, hence it is
generally considered a nuisance. We instead treat motion blur as a useful
signal that allows to compute the motion of objects from a single image.
Drawing on the success of joint segmentation and parametric motion models in
the context of optical flow estimation, we propose a parametric object motion
model combined with a segmentation mask to exploit localized, non-uniform
motion blur. Our parametric image formation model is differentiable w.r.t. the
motion parameters, which enables us to generalize marginal-likelihood
techniques from uniform blind deblurring to localized, non-uniform blur. A
two-stage pipeline, first in derivative space and then in image space, allows
to estimate both parametric object motion as well as a motion segmentation from
a single image alone. Our experiments demonstrate its ability to cope with very
challenging cases of object motion blur.

 <dc:title>A structure-exploiting numbering algorithm for finite elements on

 <dc:description>  We present a generic algorithm for numbering and then efficiently iterating
over the data values attached to an extruded mesh. An extruded mesh is formed
by replicating an existing mesh, assumed to be unstructured, to form layers of
prismatic cells. Applications of extruded meshes include, but are not limited
to, the representation of 3D high aspect ratio domains employed by geophysical
finite element simulations. These meshes are structured in the extruded
direction. The algorithm presented here exploits this structure to avoid the
performance penalty traditionally associated with unstructured meshes. We
evaluate the implementation of this algorithm in the Firedrake finite element
system on a range of low compute intensity operations which constitute worst
cases for data layout performance exploration. The experiments show that having
structure along the extruded direction enables the cost of the indirect data
accesses to be amortized after 10-20 layers as long as the underlying mesh is
well-ordered. We characterise the resulting spatial and temporal reuse in a
representative set of both continuous-Galerkin and discontinuous-Galerkin
discretisations. On meshes with realistic numbers of layers the performance
achieved is between 70% and 90% of a theoretical hardware-specific limit.

 <dc:description>  In the online graph coloring problem, vertices from a graph G, known in
advance, arrive in an online fashion and an algorithm must immediately assign a
color to each incoming vertex v so that the revealed graph is properly colored.
The exact location of v in the graph G is not known to the algorithm. The
online chromatic number of G is the smallest number of colors such that some
online algorithm is able to properly color G for any incoming order. We prove
that computing the online chromatic number of a graph is PSPACE-complete.

 <dc:description>  Humans have an impressive ability to solve complex coordination problems in a
fully distributed manner. This ability, if learned as a set of distributed
multirobot coordination strategies, can enable programming large groups of
robots to collaborate towards complex coordination objectives in a way similar
to humans. Such strategies would offer robustness, adaptability,
fault-tolerance, and, importantly, distributed decision-making. To that end, we
have designed a networked gaming platform to investigate human group behavior,
specifically in solving complex collaborative coordinated tasks. Through this
platform, we are able to limit the communication, sensing, and actuation
capabilities provided to the players. With the aim of learning coordination
algorithms for robots in mind, we define these capabilities to mimic those of a
simple ground robot.

 <dc:description>  Does information play a significant role in the foundations of physics? We
investigate whether information-theoretic constraints characterize quantum
theory. In a C*-algebraic framework, this is known to hold via three
equivalences: no broadcasting and noncommutativity; no bit commitment and
nonlocality; no signalling and kinematic independence. But this complex linear
framework could be said to build in quantum theory from the start. We show that
the first two equivalences break, and the third holds, in a framework of
generalized, possibly nonlinear, C*-algebras. This uncovers a hierarchy of
notions of when (quantum) information is classical.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, the persuasive interventions for inducing sustainable urban
mobility behaviours has become a very active research field. This review paper
systematically analyses existing approaches and prototype systems and describes
and classifies the persuasive strategies used for changing behaviour in the
domain of transport. It also studies the results and recommendations derived
from pilot studies, and as a result of this analysis highlights the need for
personalizing and tailoring persuasive technology to various user
characteristics. We also discuss the possible role of context-aware persuasive
systems for increasing the number of sustainable choices. Finally,
recommendations for future investigations on scholarly persuasive systems are
proposed.

 <dc:title>Circular Backbone Colorings: on matching and tree backbones of planar

 <dc:description>  Given a graph $G$, and a spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$, a circular
$q$-backbone $k$-coloring of $(G,H)$ is a proper $k$-coloring $c$ of $G$ such
that $q\le \lvert c(u)-c(v)\rvert \le k-q$, for every edge $uv\in E(H)$. The
circular $q$-backbone chromatic number of $(G,H)$, denoted by $CBC_q(G,H)$, is
the minimum integer $k$ for which there exists a circular $q$-backbone
$k$-coloring of $(G,H)$.
  The Four Color Theorem implies that whenever $G$ is planar, we have
$CBC_2(G,H)\le 8$. It is conjectured that this upper bound can be improved to 7
when $H$ is a tree, and to 6 when $H$ is a matching. In this work, we show
that: 1) if $G$ is planar and has no $C_4$ as subgraph, and $H$ is a linear
spanning forest of $G$, then $CBC_2(G,H)\leq 7$; 2) if $G$ is a plane graph
having no two 3-faces sharing an edge, and $H$ is a matching of $G$, then
$CBC_2(G,H)\leq 6$; and 3) if $G$ is planar and has no $C_4$ nor $C_5$ as
subgraph, and $H$ is a mathing of $G$, then $CBC_2(G,H)\leq 5$. These results
partially answer questions posed by Broersma, Fujisawa and Yoshimoto (2003),
and by Broersma, Fomin and Golovach (2007). It also points towards a positive
answer for the Steinberg's Conjecture.

 <dc:description>  Elasticity is critical for today's cloud services, which must be able to
quickly adapt to dynamically changing load conditions and resource
availability. We introduce FRAPPE, a new consistent replication platform aiming
at improving elasticity of the replicated services hosted in clouds or large
data centers. In the core of FRAPPE is a novel replicated state machine
protocol, which employs speculative executions to ensure continuous operation
during the reconfiguration periods as well as in situations where failures
prevent the agreement on the next stable configuration from being reached in a
timely fashion. We present the FRAPPE's architecture and describe the basic
techniques underlying the implementation of our speculative state machine
protocol.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a track-before-detect labeled multi-Bernoulli filter
tailored for industrial mobile platform safety applications. We derive two
application specific separable likelihood functions that capture the geometric
shape and colour information of the human targets who are wearing a high
visible vest. These likelihoods are then used in a labeled multi-Bernoulli
filter with a novel two step Bayesian update. Preliminary simulation results
show that the proposed solution can successfully track human workers wearing a
luminous yellow colour vest in an industrial environment.

 <dc:description>  More than fifty years ago, Bellman asked for the best escape path within a
known forest but for an unknown starting position. This deterministic finite
path is the shortest path that leads out of a given environment from any
starting point. There are some worst case positions where the full path length
is required. Up to now such a fixed ultimate optimal escape path for a known
shape for any starting position is only known for some special convex shapes
(i.e., circles, strips of a given width, fat convex bodies, some isosceles
triangles). Therefore, we introduce a different, simple and intuitive escape
path, the so-called certificate path. This escape path depends on the starting
position s and takes the distances from s to the outer boundary of the
environment into account. Due to the additional information, the certificate
path always (for any position s) leaves the environment earlier than the
ultimate escape path, in the above convex examples. Next we assume that fewer
information is available. Neither the precise shape of the envir- onment, nor
the location of the starting point is known. For a class of environments
(convex shapes and shapes with kernel positions), we design an online strategy
that always leaves the environment. We show that the path length for leaving
the environment is always shorter than 3.318764 the length of the corresponding
certificate path. We also give a lower bound of 3.313126, which shows that for
the above class of environments the factor 3.318764 is (almost) tight.

 <dc:description>  Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and models derived from them have been
successfully used as basic building blocks in deep artificial neural networks
for automatic features extraction, unsupervised weights initialization, but
also as density estimators. Thus, their generative and discriminative
capabilities, but also their computational time are instrumental to a wide
range of applications. Our main contribution is to look at RBMs from a
topological perspective, bringing insights from network science. Firstly, here
we show that RBMs and Gaussian RBMs (GRBMs) are bipartite graphs which
naturally have a small-world topology. Secondly, we demonstrate both on
synthetic and real-world datasets that by constraining RBMs and GRBMs to a
scale-free topology (while still considering local neighborhoods and data
distribution), we reduce the number of weights that need to be computed by a
few orders of magnitude, at virtually no loss in generative performance.
Thirdly, we show that, for a fixed number of weights, our proposed sparse
models (which by design have a higher number of hidden neurons) achieve better
generative capabilities than standard fully connected RBMs and GRBMs (which by
design have a smaller number of hidden neurons), at no additional computational
costs.

 <dc:description>  Full-duplex (FD) communication is an emerging technology that can potentially
double the throughput of cellular networks. Preliminary studies in single-cell
or small FD network deployments have revealed promising rate gains using
self-interference cancellation (SIC) techniques and receive processing.
Nevertheless, the system-level performance gains of FD small cells in
ultra-dense networks (UDNs) have not been fully investigated yet. In this
paper, we evaluate the performance of resource allocation in ultra-dense FD
small-cell networks using spatial stochastic models for the network layout and
3GPP channel models. More specifically, we consider various UDN scenarios and
assess the performance of different low-complexity user-scheduling schemes and
power allocation between uplink and downlink. We also provide useful insights
into the effect of the SIC capability on the network throughput.

 <dc:title>Bounding the optimal rate of the ICSI and ICCSI problem</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Byrne, Eimear</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work we study both the index coding with side information (ICSI)
problem introduced by Birk and Kol in 1998 and the more general problem of
index coding with coded side information (ICCSI), described by Shum et al in
2012. We estimate the optimal rate of an instance of the index coding problem.
In the ICSI problem case, we characterize those digraphs having min-rank one
less than their order and we give an upper bound on the min-rank of a
hypergraph whose incidence matrix can be associated with that of a 2-design.
Security aspects are discussed in the particular case when the design is a
projective plane. For the coded side information case, we extend the graph
theoretic upper bounds given by Shanmugam et al in 2014 on the optimal rate of
index code.

 <dc:description>  Orthogonal greedy learning (OGL) is a stepwise learning scheme that starts
with selecting a new atom from a specified dictionary via the steepest gradient
descent (SGD) and then builds the estimator through orthogonal projection. In
this paper, we find that SGD is not the unique greedy criterion and introduce a
new greedy criterion, called &quot;$\delta$-greedy threshold&quot; for learning. Based on
the new greedy criterion, we derive an adaptive termination rule for OGL. Our
theoretical study shows that the new learning scheme can achieve the existing
(almost) optimal learning rate of OGL. Plenty of numerical experiments are
provided to support that the new scheme can achieve almost optimal
generalization performance, while requiring less computation than OGL.

 <dc:description>  Q-resolution is a proof system for quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs) in
prenex conjunctive normal form (PCNF) which underlies search-based QBF solvers
with clause and cube learning (QCDCL). With the aim to derive and learn
stronger clauses and cubes earlier in the search, we generalize the axioms of
the Q-resolution calculus resulting in an exponentially more powerful proof
system. The generalized axioms introduce an interface of Q-resolution to any
other QBF proof system allowing for the direct combination of orthogonal
solving techniques. We implemented a variant of the Q-resolution calculus with
generalized axioms in the QBF solver DepQBF. As two case studies, we apply
integrated SAT solving and resource-bounded QBF preprocessing during the search
to heuristically detect potential axiom applications. Experiments with
application benchmarks indicate a substantial performance improvement.

 <dc:title>Subexponential parameterized algorithms for planar and apex-minor-free

 <dc:description>  We prove the following theorem. Given a planar graph $G$ and an integer $k$,
it is possible in polynomial time to randomly sample a subset $A$ of vertices
of $G$ with the following properties: (i) $A$ induces a subgraph of $G$ of
treewidth $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k}\log k)$, and (ii) for every connected subgraph
$H$ of $G$ on at most $k$ vertices, the probability that $A$ covers the whole
vertex set of $H$ is at least $(2^{\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k}\log^2 k)}\cdot
n^{\mathcal{O}(1)})^{-1}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$.
  Together with standard dynamic programming techniques for graphs of bounded
treewidth, this result gives a versatile technique for obtaining (randomized)
subexponential parameterized algorithms for problems on planar graphs, usually
with running time bound $2^{\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{k} \log^2 k)}
n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The technique can be applied to problems expressible as
searching for a small, connected pattern with a prescribed property in a large
host graph, examples of such problems include Directed $k$-Path, Weighted
$k$-Path, Vertex Cover Local Search, and Subgraph Isomorphism, among others. Up
to this point, it was open whether these problems can be solved in
subexponential parameterized time on planar graphs, because they are not
amenable to the classic technique of bidimensionality. Furthermore, all our
results hold in fact on any class of graphs that exclude a fixed apex graph as
a minor, in particular on graphs embeddable in any fixed surface.

 <dc:description>  Highly-repetitive collections of strings are increasingly being amassed by
genome sequencing and genetic variation experiments, as well as by storing all
versions of human-generated files, like webpages and source code. Existing
indexes for locating all the exact occurrences of a pattern in a
highly-repetitive string take advantage of a single measure of repetition.
However, multiple, distinct measures of repetition all grow sublinearly in the
length of a highly-repetitive string. In this paper we explore the practical
advantages of combining data structures whose size depends on distinct measures
of repetition. The main ingredient of our structures is the run-length encoded
BWT (RLBWT), which takes space proportional to the number of runs in the
Burrows-Wheeler transform of a string. We describe a range of practical
variants that combine RLBWT with the set of boundaries of the Lempel-Ziv 77
factors of a string, which take space proportional to the number of factors.
Such variants use, respectively, the RLBWT of a string and the RLBWT of its
reverse, or just one RLBWT inside a bidirectional index, or just one RLBWT with
support for unidirectional extraction. We also study the practical advantages
of combining RLBWT with the compact directed acyclic word graph of a string, a
data structure that takes space proportional to the number of one-character
extensions of maximal repeats. Our approaches are easy to implement, and
provide competitive tradeoffs on significant datasets.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose an approach to preference elicitation that is
suitable to large configuration spaces beyond the reach of existing
state-of-the-art approaches. Our setwise max-margin method can be viewed as a
generalization of max-margin learning to sets, and can produce a set of
&quot;diverse&quot; items that can be used to ask informative queries to the user.
Moreover, the approach can encourage sparsity in the parameter space, in order
to favor the assessment of utility towards combinations of weights that
concentrate on just few features. We present a mixed integer linear programming
formulation and show how our approach compares favourably with Bayesian
preference elicitation alternatives and easily scales to realistic datasets.

 <dc:description>  We present dynamic I/O automata (DIOA), a compositional model of dynamic
systems. In DIOA, automata can be created and destroyed dynamically, as
computation proceeds, and an automaton can dynamically change its signature,
i.e., the set of actions in which it can participate.
  DIOA features operators for parallel composition, action hiding, action
renaming, a notion of automaton creation, and a notion of behavioral subtyping
by means of trace inclusion. DIOA can model mobility, using signature
modification, and is hierarchical: a dynamically changing system of interacting
automata is itself modeled as a single automaton.
  We also show that parallel composition, action hiding, action renaming, and
(subject to some technical conditions) automaton creation are all monotonic
with respect to trace inclusion: if one component is replaced by another whose
traces are a subset of the former, then the set of traces of the system as a
whole can only be reduced.

 <dc:description>  We study the finite satisfiability problem for the two-variable fragment of
first-order logic extended with counting quantifiers (C2) and interpreted over
linearly ordered structures. We show that the problem is undecidable in the
case of two linear orders (in the presence of two other binary symbols). In the
case of one linear order it is NEXPTIME-complete, even in the presence of the
successor relation. Surprisingly, the complexity of the problem explodes when
we add one binary symbol more: C2 with one linear order and in the presence of
other binary predicate symbols is equivalent, under elementary reductions, to
the emptiness problem for multicounter automata.

 <dc:title>Dialog-based Language Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A long-term goal of machine learning research is to build an intelligent
dialog agent. Most research in natural language understanding has focused on
learning from fixed training sets of labeled data, with supervision either at
the word level (tagging, parsing tasks) or sentence level (question answering,
machine translation). This kind of supervision is not realistic of how humans
learn, where language is both learned by, and used for, communication. In this
work, we study dialog-based language learning, where supervision is given
naturally and implicitly in the response of the dialog partner during the
conversation. We study this setup in two domains: the bAbI dataset of (Weston
et al., 2015) and large-scale question answering from (Dodge et al., 2015). We
evaluate a set of baseline learning strategies on these tasks, and show that a
novel model incorporating predictive lookahead is a promising approach for
learning from a teacher's response. In particular, a surprising result is that
it can learn to answer questions correctly without any reward-based supervision
at all.

 <dc:description>  Patents represent one of the most complete sources of information related to
technological change. This paper presents three months of research on U.S.
patents in the field of patent analysis. The methodology consists of using
search terms to locate the most representative international and US patent
classes and determines the overlap of those classes to arrive at the final set
of patents and using the prediction model developed by Benson and Magee to
calculate the technological improvement rate for the technological domains. My
research focused on the Biochemical Pharmacology technological area and
selecting relevant patents for technological domains and sub-domains within
this area. The goal is to better understand structure of technology domain and
understand how fast the domains and their sub-domains progress. The method I
used is developed by Benson and Magee which is called the Classification
Overlap Method1, it provides a reliable and largely automated way to break the
patent database into understandable technological domains where progress can be
measured.

 <dc:description>  Vertex deletion problems ask whether it is possible to delete at most $k$
vertices from a graph so that the resulting graph belongs to a specified graph
class. Over the past years, the parameterized complexity of vertex deletion to
a plethora of graph classes has been systematically researched. Here we present
the first single-exponential fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for vertex
deletion to distance-hereditary graphs, a well-studied graph class which is
particularly important in the context of vertex deletion due to its connection
to the graph parameter rank-width. We complement our result with matching
asymptotic lower bounds based on the exponential time hypothesis. As an
application of our algorithm, we show that a vertex deletion set to
distance-hereditary graphs can be used as a parameter which allows
single-exponential fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for classical NP-hard
problems.

 <dc:description>  Learning goal-directed behavior in environments with sparse feedback is a
major challenge for reinforcement learning algorithms. The primary difficulty
arises due to insufficient exploration, resulting in an agent being unable to
learn robust value functions. Intrinsically motivated agents can explore new
behavior for its own sake rather than to directly solve problems. Such
intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the
environment. We present hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate
hierarchical value functions, operating at different temporal scales, with
intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level value function
learns a policy over intrinsic goals, and a lower-level function learns a
policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for
flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and relations.
This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments.
We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse,
delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process, and (2)
the classic ATARI game `Montezuma's Revenge'.

 <dc:title>Succinct Choice Dictionaries</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The choice dictionary is introduced as a data structure that can be
initialized with a parameter $n\in\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,\ldots\}$ and subsequently
maintains an initially empty subset $S$ of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ under insertion,
deletion, membership queries and an operation choice that returns an arbitrary
element of $S$. The choice dictionary appears to be fundamental in
space-efficient computing. We show that there is a choice dictionary that can
be initialized with $n$ and an additional parameter $t\in\mathbb{N}$ and
subsequently occupies $n+O(n(t/w)^t+\log n)$ bits of memory and executes each
of the four operations insert, delete, contains (i.e., a membership query) and
choice in $O(t)$ time on a word RAM with a word length of $w=\Omega(\log n)$
bits. In particular, with $w=\Theta(\log n)$, we can support insert, delete,
contains and choice in constant time using $n+O(n/(\log n)^t)$ bits for
arbitrary fixed $t$. We extend our results to maintaining several pairwise
disjoint subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
  We study additional space-efficient data structures for subsets $S$ of
$\{1,\ldots,n\}$, including one that supports only insertion and an operation
extract-choice that returns and deletes an arbitrary element of $S$. All our
main data structures can be initialized in constant time and support efficient
iteration over the set $S$, and we can allow changes to $S$ while an iteration
over $S$ is in progress. We use these abilities crucially in designing the most
space-efficient algorithms known for solving a number of graph and other
combinatorial problems in linear time. In particular, given an undirected graph
$G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, we can output a spanning forest of $G$ in
$O(n+m)$ time with at most $(1+\epsilon)n$ bits of working memory for arbitrary
fixed $\epsilon&gt;0$.

 <dc:description>  We describe the design and implementation of efficient signature and
key-exchange schemes for the AVR ATmega and ARM Cortex M0 microcontrollers,
targeting the 128-bit security level. Our algorithms are based on an efficient
Montgomery ladder scalar multiplication on the Kummer surface of Gaudry and
Schost's genus-2 hyperelliptic curve, combined with the Jacobian point recovery
technique of Costello, Chung, and Smith. Our results are the first to show the
feasibility of software-only hyperelliptic cryptography on constrained
platforms, and represent a significant improvement on the elliptic-curve
state-of-the-art for both key exchange and signatures on these architectures.
Notably, our key-exchange scalar-multiplication software runs in under 9740k
cycles on the ATmega, and under 2650k cycles on the Cortex M0.

 <dc:description>  The cuckoo filter data structure of Fan, Andersen, Kaminsky, and Mitzenmacher
(CoNEXT 2014) performs the same approximate set operations as a Bloom filter in
less memory, with better locality of reference, and adds the ability to delete
elements as well as to insert them. However, until now it has lacked
theoretical guarantees on its performance. We describe a simplified version of
the cuckoo filter using fewer hash function calls per query. With this
simplification, we provide the first theoretical performance guarantees on
cuckoo filters, showing that they succeed with high probability whenever their
fingerprint length is large enough.

 <dc:description>  Answering science questions posed in natural language is an important AI
challenge. Answering such questions often requires non-trivial inference and
knowledge that goes beyond factoid retrieval. Yet, most systems for this task
are based on relatively shallow Information Retrieval (IR) and statistical
correlation techniques operating on large unstructured corpora. We propose a
structured inference system for this task, formulated as an Integer Linear
Program (ILP), that answers natural language questions using a semi-structured
knowledge base derived from text, including questions requiring multi-step
inference and a combination of multiple facts. On a dataset of real, unseen
science questions, our system significantly outperforms (+14%) the best
previous attempt at structured reasoning for this task, which used Markov Logic
Networks (MLNs). It also improves upon a previous ILP formulation by 17.7%.
When combined with unstructured inference methods, the ILP system significantly
boosts overall performance (+10%). Finally, we show our approach is
substantially more robust to a simple answer perturbation compared to
statistical correlation methods.

 <dc:description>  Due to the abundance of 2D product images from the Internet, developing
efficient and scalable algorithms to recover the missing depth information is
central to many applications. Recent works have addressed the single-view depth
estimation problem by utilizing convolutional neural networks. In this paper,
we show that exploring symmetry information, which is ubiquitous in man made
objects, can significantly boost the quality of such depth predictions.
Specifically, we propose a new convolutional neural network architecture to
first estimate dense symmetric correspondences in a product image and then
propose an optimization which utilizes this information explicitly to
significantly improve the quality of single-view depth estimations. We have
evaluated our approach extensively, and experimental results show that this
approach outperforms state-of-the-art depth estimation techniques.

 <dc:description>  Brand recognition is a very challenging topic with many useful applications
in localization recognition, advertisement and marketing. In this paper we
present an automatic graphic logo detection system that robustly handles
unconstrained imaging conditions. Our approach is based on Fast Region-based
Convolutional Networks (FRCN) proposed by Ross Girshick, which have shown
state-of-the-art performance in several generic object recognition tasks
(PASCAL Visual Object Classes challenges). In particular, we use two CNN models
pre-trained with the ILSVRC ImageNet dataset and we look at the selective
search of windows `proposals' in the pre-processing stage and data augmentation
to enhance the logo recognition rate. The novelty lies in the use of transfer
learning to leverage powerful Convolutional Neural Network models trained with
large-scale datasets and repurpose them in the context of graphic logo
detection. Another benefit of this framework is that it allows for multiple
detections of graphic logos using regions that are likely to have an object.
Experimental results with the FlickrLogos-32 dataset show not only the
promising performance of our developed models with respect to noise and other
transformations a graphic logo can be subject to, but also its superiority over
state-of-the-art systems with hand-crafted models and features.

 <dc:description>  A speaker cluster-based speaker adaptive training (SAT) method under deep
neural network-hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) framework is presented in this
paper. During training, speakers that are acoustically adjacent to each other
are hierarchically clustered using an i-vector based distance metric. DNNs with
speaker dependent layers are then adaptively trained for each cluster of
speakers. Before decoding starts, an unseen speaker in test set is matched to
the closest speaker cluster through comparing i-vector based distances. The
previously trained DNN of the matched speaker cluster is used for decoding
utterances of the test speaker. The performance of the proposed method on a
large vocabulary spontaneous speech recognition task is evaluated on a training
set of with 1500 hours of speech, and a test set of 24 speakers with 1774
utterances. Comparing to a speaker independent DNN with a baseline word error
rate of 11.6%, a relative 6.8% reduction in word error rate is observed from
the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  We develop and apply combinatorial algorithms for investigation of the
feasible distance distributions of binary orthogonal arrays with respect to a
point of the ambient binary Hamming space utilizing constraints imposed from
the relations between the distance distributions of connected arrays. This
turns out to be strong enough and we prove the nonexistence of binary
orthogonal arrays of parameters (length, cardinality, strength)$\
=(9,6.2^4=96,4)$, $(10,6.2^5,5)$, $(10,7.2^4=112,4)$, $(11,7.2^5,5)$,
$(11,7.2^4,4)$ and $(12,7.2^5,5)$, resolving the first cases where the
existence was undecided so far. For the existing arrays our approach allows
substantial reduction of the number of feasible distance distributions which
could be helpful for classification results (uniqueness, for example).

 <dc:title>XPL: An extended probabilistic logic for probabilistic transition

 <dc:description>  Generalized Probabilistic Logic (GPL) is a temporal logic, based on the modal
mu-calculus, for specifying properties of reactive probabilistic systems. We
explore XPL, an extension to GPL allowing the semantics of nondeterminism
present in Markov decision processes (MDPs). XPL is expressive enough that a
number of independently studied problems--- such as termination of Recursive
MDPs (RMDPs), PCTL* model checking of MDPs, and reachability for Branching
MDPs--- can all be cast as model checking over XPL. Termination of multi-exit
RMDPs is undecidable; thus, model checking in XPL is undecidable in general. We
define a subclass, called separable XPL, for which model checking is decidable.
Decidable problems such as termination of 1-exit RMDPs, PCTL* model checking of
MDPs, and reachability for Branching MDPs can be reduced to model checking
separable XPL. Thus, XPL forms a uniform framework for studying problems
involving systems with non-deterministic and probabilistic behaviors, while
separable XPL provides a way to solve decidable fragments of these problems.

 <dc:description>  We present a tree-structured network architecture for large scale image
classification. The trunk of the network contains convolutional layers
optimized over all classes. At a given depth, the trunk splits into separate
branches, each dedicated to discriminate a different subset of classes. Each
branch acts as an expert classifying a set of categories that are difficult to
tell apart, while the trunk provides common knowledge to all experts in the
form of shared features. The training of our &quot;network of experts&quot; is completely
end-to-end: the partition of categories into disjoint subsets is learned
simultaneously with the parameters of the network trunk and the experts are
trained jointly by minimizing a single learning objective over all classes. The
proposed structure can be built from any existing convolutional neural network
(CNN). We demonstrate its generality by adapting 4 popular CNNs for image
categorization into the form of networks of experts. Our experiments on
CIFAR100 and ImageNet show that in every case our method yields a substantial
improvement in accuracy over the base CNN, and gives the best result achieved
so far on CIFAR100. Finally, the improvement in accuracy comes at little
additional cost: compared to the base network, the training time is only
moderately increased and the number of parameters is comparable or in some
cases even lower.

 <dc:description>  Aedes Aegypti is the vector of several deadly diseases, including Zika.
Effective and sustainable vector control measures must be deployed to keep A.
aegypti numbers under control. The distribution of A. Aegypti is subject to
spatial and climatic constraints. Using agent-based modeling, we model the
population dynamics of A. aegypti subjected to the spatial and climatic
constraints of a neighborhood in the Key West. Satellite imagery was used to
identify vegetation, houses (CO2 zones) both critical to the mosquito
lifecycle. The model replicates the seasonal fluctuation of adult population
sampled through field studies and approximates the population at a high of 986
(95% CI: [979, 993]) females and 1031 (95% CI: [1024, 1039]) males in the fall
and a low of 316 (95% CI: [313, 319]) females and 333 (95% CI: [330, 336])
males during the winter. We then simulate two biological vector control
strategies: 1) Wolbachia infection and 2) Release of Insects carrying a
Dominant Lethal gene (RIDL). Our results support the probability of sustained
Wolbachia infection within the population for two years after the year of
release. egies, our approach provides a realistic simulation environment
consisting of male and female Aedes aegypti, breeding spots, vegetation and CO2
sources.

 <dc:title>Embedded all relevant feature selection with Random Ferns</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kursa, Miron Bartosz</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many machine learning methods can produce variable importance scores
expressing the usability of each feature in context of the produced model;
those scores on their own are yet not sufficient to generate feature selection,
especially when an all relevant selection is required. Although there are
wrapper methods aiming to solve this problem, they introduce a substantial
increase in the required computational effort.
  In this paper I investigate an idea of incorporating all relevant selection
within the training process by producing importance for implicitly generated
shadows, attributes irrelevant by design. I propose and evaluate such a method
in context of random ferns classifier. Experiment results confirm the
effectiveness of such approach, although show that fully stochastic nature of
random ferns limits its applicability either to small dimensions or as a part
of a broader feature selection procedure.

to the criteria set out by Christopher Lynch and Barbara Morawska in their
seminal paper &quot;Basic Syntactic Mutation.&quot; The equational unification problem
modulo such a rewrite system is solvable in polynomial-time. In this paper, we
derive properties of such a system which we call an $LM$-system. We show, in
particular, that the rewrite rules in an $LM$-system have no left- or
right-overlaps. We also show that despite the restricted nature of an
$LM$-system, there are important undecidable problems, such as the deduction
problem in cryptographic protocol analysis (also called the the cap problem)
that remain undecidable for $LM$-systems.

 <dc:title>Location-Based Beamforming and Physical Layer Security in Rician Wiretap
  Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Chenxi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Malaney, Robert</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new location-based beamforming (LBB) scheme for wiretap
channels, where a multi-antenna source communicates with a single-antenna
legitimate receiver in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper. We assume
that all channels are in a Rician fading environment, the channel state
information from the legitimate receiver is perfectly known at the source, and
that the only information on the eavesdropper available at the source is her
location. We first describe how the optimal beamforming vector that minimizes
the secrecy outage probability of the system is obtained, illustrating its
dependence on the eavesdropper's location. We then derive an easy-to-compute
expression for the secrecy outage probability when our proposed LBB scheme is
adopted. We also consider the positive impact a friendly jammer can have on our
beamforming solution, showing how the path to optimality remains the same.
Finally, we investigate the impact of location uncertainty on the secrecy
outage probability, showing how our solution can still allow for secrecy even
when the source only has a noisy estimate of the eavesdropper's location. Our
work demonstrates how a multi-antenna array, operating in the most general
channel conditions and most likely system set-up, can be configured rapidly in
the field so as to deliver an optimal physical layer security solution.

 <dc:title>Enhancing Multiuser MIMO Through Opportunistic D2D Cooperation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We propose a cellular architecture that combines multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO)
downlink with opportunistic use of unlicensed ISM bands to establish
device-to-device (D2D) cooperation. The architecture consists of a
physical-layer cooperation scheme based on forming downlink virtual MIMO
channels through D2D relaying, and a novel resource allocation strategy for
such D2D-enabled networks. We prove the approximate optimality of the
physical-layer scheme, and demonstrate that such cooperation boosts the
effective SNR of the weakest user in the system, especially in the many-user
regime, due to multiuser diversity. To harness this physical-layer scheme, we
formulate the cooperative user scheduling and relay selection problem using the
network utility maximization framework. For such a cooperative network, we
propose a novel utility metric that jointly captures fairness in throughput and
the cost of relaying in the system. We propose a joint user scheduling and
relay selection algorithm, which we prove to be asymptotically optimal. We
study the architecture through system-level simulations over a wide range of
scenarios. The highlight of these simulations is an approximately $6$x
improvement in data rate for cell-edge (bottom fifth-percentile) users (over
the state-of-the-art SU-MIMO) while still improving the overall throughput, and
taking into account various system constraints.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new discriminative model named \emph{nonextensive
information theoretical machine (NITM)} based on nonextensive generalization of
Shannon information theory. In NITM, weight parameters are treated as random
variables. Tsallis divergence is used to regularize the distribution of weight
parameters and maximum unnormalized Tsallis entropy distribution is used to
evaluate fitting effect. On the one hand, it is showed that some well-known
margin-based loss functions such as $\ell_{0/1}$ loss, hinge loss, squared
hinge loss and exponential loss can be unified by unnormalized Tsallis entropy.
On the other hand, Gaussian prior regularization is generalized to Student-t
prior regularization with similar computational complexity. The model can be
solved efficiently by gradient-based convex optimization and its performance is
illustrated on standard datasets.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks are state-of-the-art models for understanding the
content of images, video and raw input data. However, implementing a deep
neural network in embedded systems is a challenging task, because a typical
deep neural network, such as a Deep Belief Network using 128x128 images as
input, could exhaust Giga bytes of memory and result in bandwidth and computing
bottleneck. To address this challenge, this paper presents a hardware-oriented
deep learning algorithm, named as the Deep Adaptive Network, which attempts to
exploit the sparsity in the neural connections. The proposed method adaptively
reduces the weights associated with negligible features to zero, leading to
sparse feedforward network architecture. Furthermore, since the small
proportion of important weights are significantly larger than zero, they can be
robustly thresholded and represented using single-bit integers (-1 and +1),
leading to implementations of deep neural networks with sparse and binary
connections. Our experiments showed that, for the application of recognizing
MNIST handwritten digits, the features extracted by a two-layer Deep Adaptive
Network with about 25% reserved important connections achieved 97.2%
classification accuracy, which was almost the same with the standard Deep
Belief Network (97.3%). Furthermore, for efficient hardware implementations,
the sparse-and-binary-weighted deep neural network could save about 99.3%
memory and 99.9% computation units without significant loss of classification
accuracy for pattern recognition applications.

 <dc:description>  This paper outlines the development of a sensory feedback device providing a
tangible interface for controlling digital environments, in this example a
flight simulator, where the intention for the device is that it is relatively
low cost, versatile and intuitive. Gesture based input allows for a more
immersive experience, so rather than making the user feel like they are
controlling an aircraft the intuitive interface allows the user to become the
aircraft that is controlled by the movements of the user's hand. The movements
are designed to allow a sense of immersion that would be difficult to achieve
with an alternative interface. A vibrotactile based haptic feedback is
incorporated in the device to further enhance the connection between the user
and the game environment by providing immediate confirmation of game events.
When used for navigating an aircraft simulator, this device invites playful
action and thrill. It bridges new territory on portable, low cost solutions for
haptic devices in gaming contexts.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the player's body as a system capable of unfamiliar
interactive movement achieved through digital mediation in a playful
environment. Body interactions in both digital and non-digital environments can
be considered as a perceptually manipulative exploration of self. This implies
a player may alter how they perceive their body and its operations in order to
create a new playful and original experience. This paper therefore questions
how player interaction can change as their perception of their body changes
using augmentative technology.

 <dc:description>  This paper puts forward the perspective that social play spaces are
opportunities to utilise both technology and body for the benefit of community
culture and engagement. Co-located social gaming coupled with tangible
interfaces offer active participant engagement and the development of the local
video game scene. This paper includes a descriptive account of Rabble Room
Arcade, an experimental social event combining custom-built physical interface
devices and multiplayer video games.

 <dc:title>The Extended Littlestone's Dimension for Learning with Mistakes and
  Abstentions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Chicheng</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Chaudhuri, Kamalika</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies classification with an abstention option in the online
setting. In this setting, examples arrive sequentially, the learner is given a
hypothesis class $\mathcal H$, and the goal of the learner is to either predict
a label on each example or abstain, while ensuring that it does not make more
than a pre-specified number of mistakes when it does predict a label.
  Previous work on this problem has left open two main challenges. First, not
much is known about the optimality of algorithms, and in particular, about what
an optimal algorithmic strategy is for any individual hypothesis class. Second,
while the realizable case has been studied, the more realistic non-realizable
scenario is not well-understood. In this paper, we address both challenges.
First, we provide a novel measure, called the Extended Littlestone's Dimension,
which captures the number of abstentions needed to ensure a certain number of
mistakes. Second, we explore the non-realizable case, and provide upper and
lower bounds on the number of abstentions required by an algorithm to guarantee
a specified number of mistakes.

 <dc:description>  The statistical analysis of the fading End to End channel gain of the amplify
and forward relaying protocol, however, is well known as extremely complex, and
research work to date have only studied the asymptotic behaviour of the outage
probability of the network at either very low or very high Signal Noise Ratios.
Most current works circumvent the analytical complexity by first ignoring the
effect of Additive White Gaussian noise then by using the simple approximated
upper bound for the Signal Noise Ratio. The new approximated upper bound
proposed in this paper, is far better bound than the previous results for the
entire Signal Noise Ratio, which allows us to derive exact analytical
expressions to study the effect of Additive White Gaussian noise on the network
performance.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops a non-parametric test for consistency of players'
behavior in a series of games with the Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE). The
test exploits a characterization of the equilibrium choice probabilities in any
structural QRE as the gradient of a convex function, which thus satisfies the
cyclic monotonicity inequalities. Our testing procedure utilizes recent
econometric results for moment inequality models. We assess our test using lab
experimental data from a series of generalized matching pennies games. We
reject the QRE hypothesis in the pooled data, but it cannot be rejected in the
individual data for over half of the subjects.

 <dc:description>  We propose a systematic approach to reduce the memory consumption of deep
neural network training. Specifically, we design an algorithm that costs
O(sqrt(n)) memory to train a n layer network, with only the computational cost
of an extra forward pass per mini-batch. As many of the state-of-the-art models
hit the upper bound of the GPU memory, our algorithm allows deeper and more
complex models to be explored, and helps advance the innovations in deep
learning research. We focus on reducing the memory cost to store the
intermediate feature maps and gradients during training. Computation graph
analysis is used for automatic in-place operation and memory sharing
optimizations. We show that it is possible to trade computation for memory -
giving a more memory efficient training algorithm with a little extra
computation cost. In the extreme case, our analysis also shows that the memory
consumption can be reduced to O(log n) with as little as O(n log n) extra cost
for forward computation. Our experiments show that we can reduce the memory
cost of a 1,000-layer deep residual network from 48G to 7G with only 30 percent
additional running time cost on ImageNet problems. Similarly, significant
memory cost reduction is observed in training complex recurrent neural networks
on very long sequences.

 <dc:description>  To save energy and alleviate interferences in a wireless sensor network, the
usage of virtual backbone was proposed. Because of accidental damages or energy
depletion, it is desirable to construct a fault tolerant virtual backbone,
which can be modeled as a $k$-connected $m$-fold dominating set (abbreviated as
$(k,m)$-CDS) in a graph. A node set $C\subseteq V(G)$ is a $(k,m)$-CDS of graph
$G$ if every node in $V(G)\backslash C$ is adjacent with at least $m$ nodes in
$C$ and the subgraph of $G$ induced by $C$ is $k$-connected. In this paper, we
present an approximation algorithm for the minimum $(3,m)$-CDS problem with
$m\geq3$. The performance ratio is at most $\gamma$, where
$\gamma=\alpha+8+2\ln(2\alpha-6)$ for $\alpha\geq4$ and $\gamma=3\alpha+2\ln2$
for $\alpha&lt;4$, and $\alpha$ is the performance ratio for the minimum
$(2,m)$-CDS problem. Using currently best known value of $\alpha$, the
performance ratio is $\ln\delta+o(\ln\delta)$, where $\delta$ is the maximum
degree of the graph, which is asymptotically best possible in view of the
non-approximability of the problem. This is the first performance-guaranteed
algorithm for the minimum $(3,m)$-CDS problem on a general graph. Furthermore,
applying our algorithm on a unit disk graph which models a homogeneous wireless
sensor network, the performance ratio is less than 27, improving previous ratio
62.3 by a large amount for the $(3,m)$-CDS problem on a unit disk graph.

 <dc:description>  Automatically recognizing and localizing wide ranges of human actions has
crucial importance for video understanding. Towards this goal, the THUMOS
challenge was introduced in 2013 to serve as a benchmark for action
recognition. Until then, video action recognition, including THUMOS challenge,
had focused primarily on the classification of pre-segmented (i.e., trimmed)
videos, which is an artificial task. In THUMOS 2014, we elevated action
recognition to a more practical level by introducing temporally untrimmed
videos. These also include `background videos' which share similar scenes and
backgrounds as action videos, but are devoid of the specific actions. The three
editions of the challenge organized in 2013--2015 have made THUMOS a common
benchmark for action classification and detection and the annual challenge is
widely attended by teams from around the world.
  In this paper we describe the THUMOS benchmark in detail and give an overview
of data collection and annotation procedures. We present the evaluation
protocols used to quantify results in the two THUMOS tasks of action
classification and temporal detection. We also present results of submissions
to the THUMOS 2015 challenge and review the participating approaches.
Additionally, we include a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the
differences in action recognition between trimmed and untrimmed videos, and how
well methods trained on trimmed videos generalize to untrimmed videos. We
conclude by proposing several directions and improvements for future THUMOS
challenges.

 <dc:description>  Evolutionary algorithms have been widely studied from a theoretical
perspective. In particular, the area of runtime analysis has contributed
significantly to a theoretical understanding and provided insights into the
working behaviour of these algorithms. We study how these insights into
evolutionary processes can be used for evolutionary art. We introduce the
notion of evolutionary image transition which transfers a given starting image
into a target image through an evolutionary process. Combining standard
mutation effects known from the optimization of the classical benchmark
function OneMax and different variants of random walks, we present ways of
performing evolutionary image transition with different artistic effects.

 <dc:description>  Matrix factorization is a key component of collaborative filtering-based
recommendation systems because it allows us to complete sparse user-by-item
ratings matrices under a low-rank assumption that encodes the belief that
similar users give similar ratings and that similar items garner similar
ratings. This paradigm has had immeasurable practical success, but it is not
the complete story for understanding and inferring the preferences of people.
First, peoples' preferences and their observable manifestations as ratings
evolve over time along general patterns of trajectories. Second, an individual
person's preferences evolve over time through influence of their social
connections. In this paper, we develop a unified process model for both types
of dynamics within a state space approach, together with an efficient
optimization scheme for estimation within that model. The model combines
elements from recent developments in dynamic matrix factorization, opinion
dynamics and social learning, and trust-based recommendation. The estimation
builds upon recent advances in numerical nonlinear optimization. Empirical
results on a large-scale data set from the Epinions website demonstrate
consistent reduction in root mean squared error by consideration of the two
types of dynamics.

 <dc:title>Articulated Hand Pose Estimation Review</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Barsoum, Emad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the increase number of companies focusing on commercializing Augmented
Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and wearable devices, the need for a hand
based input mechanism is becoming essential in order to make the experience
natural, seamless and immersive. Hand pose estimation has progressed
drastically in recent years due to the introduction of commodity depth cameras.
  Hand pose estimation based on vision is still a challenging problem due to
its complexity from self-occlusion (between fingers), close similarity between
fingers, dexterity of the hands, speed of the pose and the high dimension of
the hand kinematic parameters. Articulated hand pose estimation is still an
open problem and under intensive research from both academia and industry.
  The 2 approaches used for hand pose estimation are: discriminative and
generative. Generative approach is a model based that tries to fit a hand model
to the observed data. Discriminative approach is appearance based, usually
implemented with machine learning (ML) and require a large amount of training
data. Recent hand pose estimation uses hybrid approach by combining both
discriminative and generative methods into a single hand pipeline.
  In this paper, we focus on reviewing recent progress of hand pose estimation
from depth sensor. We will survey discriminative methods, generative methods
and hybrid methods. This paper is not a comprehensive review of all hand pose
estimation techniques, it is a subset of some of the recent state-of-the-art
techniques.

 <dc:title>Interference Management in Massive MIMO HetNets: A Nested Array Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  The nested array, which is implemented by nonuniform antenna placement, is an
effective approach to achieve O(N^2) degrees of freedom (DoF) with an antenna
array of N antennas. Such DoF refers to the number of directions of incoming
signals that can be resolved. With the increased number of DoF, an important
application of nested array is to nullify the interference signals from
multiple directions. In this paper, we apply nested array in a massive MIMO
heterogeneous network (HetNet) for interference management. With nested array
based interference nulling, each base station (BS) can nullify a certain number
of interference signals. A key design issue is to select the interference
sources to be nullified at each BS. We formulate this problem as an integer
programming problem. The objective is to maximize the sum rate of all users,
subject to BS DoF constraints. We propose an approximation scheme to solve this
problem and derive a performance upper bound. Simulation results show that the
proposed scheme effectively improves the sum rate and achieves a near optimal
performance.

 <dc:description>  Existing approaches to synthesize reactive systems from declarative
specifications mostly rely on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), inheriting their
scalability issues. We present novel algorithms for safety specifications that
use decision procedures for propositional formulas (SAT solvers), Quantified
Boolean Formulas (QBF solvers), or Effectively Propositional Logic (EPR). Our
algorithms are based on query learning, templates, reduction to EPR, QBF
certification, and interpolation. A parallelization combines multiple
algorithms. Our optimizations expand quantifiers and utilize unreachable states
and variable independencies. Our approach outperforms a simple BDD-based tool
and is competitive with a highly optimized one. It won two medals in the
SyntComp competition.

 <dc:description>  In a seminal paper, McAfee (1992) presented a truthful mechanism for double
auction, attaining asymptotically-optimal gain-from-trade without any prior
information on the valuations of the traders. McAfee's mechanism handles
single-parametric agents, allowing each seller to sell a single item and each
buyer to buy a single item.
  In this paper, we present a double-auction mechanism that handles
multi-parametric agents and allow multiple items per trader. Each seller is
endowed with several units of a pre-specified type and has diminishing marginal
returns. Each buyer may buy multiple types and has a gross-substitute valuation
function. Both buyers and sellers are quasi-linear in money.
  The mechanism is prior-free, ex-post individually-rational, dominant-strategy
truthful and strongly budget-balanced. Its gain-from-trade approaches the
optimum when the market in all item-types is sufficiently large.

 <dc:description>  Asynchronous random access (RA) protocols are particularly attractive for
their simplicity and avoidance of tight synchronization requirements. Recent
enhancements have shown that the use of successive interference cancellation
(SIC) can largely boost the performance of these schemes. A further step
forward in the performance can be attained when diversity combining techniques
are applied. In order to enable combining, the detection and association of the
packets to their transmitters has to be done prior to decoding. We present a
solution to this problem, that articulates into two phases. Non-coherent
soft-correlation as well as interference-aware soft-correlation are used for
packet detection. We evaluate the detection capabilities of both solutions via
numerical simulations. We also evaluate numerically the spectral efficiency
achieved by the proposed approach, highlighting its benefits.

 <dc:description>  Application of UAV in indoor environment is emerging nowadays due to the
advancements in technology. UAV brings more space-flexibility in an occupied or
hardly-accessible indoor environment, e.g., shop floor of manufacturing
industry, greenhouse, nuclear powerplant. UAV helps in creating an autonomous
manufacturing system by executing tasks with less human intervention in
time-efficient manner. Consequently, a scheduler is one essential component to
be focused on; yet the number of reported studies on UAV scheduling has been
minimal. This work proposes a methodology with a heuristic (based on Earliest
Available Time algorithm) which assigns tasks to UAVs with an objective of
minimizing the makespan. In addition, a quick response towards uncertain events
and a quick creation of new high-quality feasible schedule are needed. Hence,
the proposed heuristic is incorporated with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
algorithm to find a quick near optimal schedule. This proposed methodology is
implemented into a scheduler and tested on a few scales of datasets generated
based on a real flight demonstration. Performance evaluation of scheduler is
discussed in detail and the best solution obtained from a selected set of
parameters is reported.

 <dc:title>Incremental Reconstruction of Urban Environments by Edge-Points Delaunay
  Triangulation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Urban reconstruction from a video captured by a surveying vehicle constitutes
a core module of automated mapping. When computational power represents a
limited resource and, a detailed map is not the primary goal, the
reconstruction can be performed incrementally, from a monocular video, carving
a 3D Delaunay triangulation of sparse points; this allows online incremental
mapping for tasks such as traversability analysis or obstacle avoidance. To
exploit the sharp edges of urban landscape, we propose to use a Delaunay
triangulation of Edge-Points, which are the 3D points corresponding to image
edges. These points constrain the edges of the 3D Delaunay triangulation to
real-world edges. Besides the use of the Edge-Points, a second contribution of
this paper is the Inverse Cone Heuristic that preemptively avoids the creation
of artifacts in the reconstructed manifold surface. We force the reconstruction
of a manifold surface since it makes it possible to apply computer graphics or
photometric refinement algorithms to the output mesh. We evaluated our approach
on four real sequences of the public available KITTI dataset by comparing the
incremental reconstruction against Velodyne measurements.

 <dc:title>Non-iterative Type 4 and 5 Nonuniform FFT Methods in the One-Dimensional
  Case</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Selva, J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The so-called non-uniform FFT (NFFT) is a family of algorithms for
efficiently computing the Fourier transform of finite-length signals, whenever
the time or frequency grid is nonuniformly spaced. Following the usual
classification, there exist five NFFT types. Types 1 and 2 make it possible to
pass from the time to the frequency domain with nonuniform input and output
grids respectively. Type 3 allows for both input and output nonuniform grids.
Finally, types 4 and 5 are the inverses of types 1 and 2 and are expensive
computationally, given that they involve iterative methods. In this paper, we
solve this last drawback in the one-dimensional case by presenting
non-iterative type 4 and 5 NFFT methods that just involve three NFFTs of types
1 or 2 plus some additional FFTs. The methods are based on exploiting the
structure of the Lagrange interpolation formula. The paper includes several
numerical examples in which the proposed methods are compared with the Gaussian
elimination (GE) and conjugate gradient (CG) methods, both in terms of
round-off error and computational burden.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We address the problem of novelty detection in multiclass scenarios where
some class labels are missing from the training set. Our method is based on the
initial assignment of confidence values, which measure the affinity between a
new test point and each known class. We first compare the values of the two top
elements in this vector of confidence values. In the heart of our method lies
the training of an ensemble of classifiers, each trained to discriminate known
from novel classes based on some partition of the training data into
presumed-known and presumednovel classes. Our final novelty score is derived
from the output of this ensemble of classifiers. We evaluated our method on two
datasets of images containing a relatively large number of classes - the
Caltech-256 and Cifar-100 datasets. We compared our method to 3 alternative
methods which represent commonly used approaches, including the one-class SVM,
novelty based on k-NN, novelty based on maximal confidence, and the recent
KNFST method. The results show a very clear and marked advantage for our method
over all alternative methods, in an experimental setup where class labels are
missing during training.

 <dc:description>  Word spotting is an important recognition task in historical document
analysis. In most cases methods are developed and evaluated assuming perfect
word segmentations. In this paper we propose an experimental framework to
quantify the effect of goodness of word segmentation has on the performance
achieved by word spotting methods in identical unbiased conditions. The
framework consists of generating systematic distortions on segmentation and
retrieving the original queries from the distorted dataset. We apply the
framework on the George Washington and Barcelona Marriage Dataset and on
several established and state-of-the-art methods. The experiments allow for an
estimate of the end-to-end performance of word spotting methods.

 <dc:title>Are there too many uncited articles? Zero inflated variants of the
  discretised lognormal and hooked power law distributions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Thelwall, Mike</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Although statistical models fit many citation data sets reasonably well with
the best fitting models being the hooked power law and discretised lognormal
distribution, the fits are rarely close. One possible reason is that there
might be more uncited articles than would be predicted by any model if some
articles are inherently uncitable. Using data from 23 different Scopus
categories, this article tests the assumption that removing a proportion of
uncited articles from a citation dataset allows statistical distributions to
have much closer fits. It also introduces two new models, zero inflated
discretised lognormal distribution and the zero inflated hooked power law
distribution and algorithms to fit them. In all 23 cases, the zero inflated
version of the discretised lognormal distribution was an improvement on the
standard version and in 15 out of 23 cases the zero inflated version of the
hooked power law was an improvement on the standard version. Without zero
inflation the discretised lognormal models fit the data better than the hooked
power law distribution 6 out of 23 times and with it, the discretised lognormal
models fit the data better than the hooked power law distribution 9 out of 23
times. Apparently uncitable articles seem to occur due to the presence of
academic-related magazines in Scopus categories. In conclusion, future citation
analysis and research indicators should take into account uncitable articles,
and the best fitting distribution for sets of citation counts from a single
subject and year is either the zero inflated discretised lognormal or zero
inflated hooked power law.

 <dc:title>Knowledge model: a method to evaluate an individual's knowledge

 <dc:creator>Liu, Gangli</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  As the quantity of human knowledge increasing rapidly, it is harder and
harder to evaluate a knowledge worker's knowledge quantitatively. There are
lots of demands for evaluating a knowledge worker's knowledge. For example,
accurately finding out a researcher's research concentrations for the last
three years; searching for common topics for two scientists with different
academic backgrounds; helping a researcher discover his deficiencies on a
research field etc. This paper proposes a method named knowledge model to
evaluate a knowledge worker's knowledge quantitatively without taking an
examination. It records and analyzes an individual's each learning experience,
discovering all the involved knowledge points and calculating their shares by
analyzing the text learning contents with topic model. It calculates a score
for a knowledge point by accumulating the effects of one's all learning
experiences about it. A preliminary knowledge evaluating system is developed to
testify the practicability of knowledge model.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a new approach to incrementally initialize a
manifold surface for automatic 3D reconstruction from images. More precisely we
focus on the automatic initialization of a 3D mesh as close as possible to the
final solution; indeed many approaches require a good initial solution for
further refinement via multi-view stereo techniques. Our novel algorithm
automatically estimates an initial manifold mesh for surface evolving
multi-view stereo algorithms, where the manifold property needs to be enforced.
It bootstraps from 3D points extracted via Structure from Motion, then iterates
between a state-of-the-art manifold reconstruction step and a novel mesh
sweeping algorithm that looks for new 3D points in the neighborhood of the
reconstructed manifold to be added in the manifold reconstruction. The
experimental results show quantitatively that the mesh sweeping improves the
resolution and the accuracy of the manifold reconstruction, allowing a better
convergence of state-of-the-art surface evolution multi-view stereo algorithms.

 <dc:title>The Dynamics of Initiative in Communication Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Human social interaction is often intermittent. Two acquainted persons can
have extended periods without social interaction punctuated by periods of
repeated interaction. In this case, the repeated interaction can be
characterized by a seed initiative by either of the persons and a number of
follow-up interactions. The tendency to initiate social interaction plays an
important role in the formation of social networks and is in general not
symmetric between persons. In this paper, we study the dynamics of initiative
by analysing and modeling a detailed call and text message network sampled from
a group of 700 individuals. We show that in an average relationship between two
individuals, one part is almost twice as likely to initiate communication
compared to the other part. The asymmetry has social consequences and
ultimately might lead to the discontinuation of a relationship. We explain the
observed asymmetry by a positive feedback mechanism where individuals already
taking initiative are more likely to take initiative in the future. In general,
people with many initiatives receive attention from a broader spectrum of
friends than people with few initiatives. Lastly, we compare the likelihood of
taking initiative with the basic personality traits of the five factor model.

 <dc:description>  We study data structure problems related to document indexing and pattern
matching queries and our main contribution is to show that the pointer machine
model of computation can be extremely useful in proving high and unconditional
lower bounds that cannot be obtained in any other known model of computation
with the current techniques. Often our lower bounds match the known space-query
time trade-off curve and in fact for all the problems considered, there is a
very good and reasonable match between the our lower bounds and the known upper
bounds, at least for some choice of input parameters. The problems that we
consider are set intersection queries (both the reporting variant and the
semi-group counting variant), indexing a set of documents for two-pattern
queries, or forbidden- pattern queries, or queries with wild-cards, and
indexing an input set of gapped-patterns (or two-patterns) to find those
matching a document given at the query time.

 <dc:description>  The relevance between a query and a document in search can be represented as
matching degree between the two objects. Latent space models have been proven
to be effective for the task, which are often trained with click-through data.
One technical challenge with the approach is that it is hard to train a model
for tail queries and tail documents for which there are not enough clicks. In
this paper, we propose to address the challenge by learning a latent matching
model, using not only click-through data but also semantic knowledge. The
semantic knowledge can be categories of queries and documents as well as
synonyms of words, manually or automatically created. Specifically, we
incorporate semantic knowledge into the objective function by including
regularization terms. We develop two methods to solve the learning task on the
basis of coordinate descent and gradient descent respectively, which can be
employed in different settings. Experimental results on two datasets from an
app search engine demonstrate that our model can make effective use of semantic
knowledge, and thus can significantly enhance the accuracies of latent matching
models, particularly for tail queries.

 <dc:description>  Learning and generating Chinese poems is a charming yet challenging task.
Traditional approaches involve various language modeling and machine
translation techniques, however, they perform not as well when generating poems
with complex pattern constraints, for example Song iambics, a famous type of
poems that involve variable-length sentences and strict rhythmic patterns. This
paper applies the attention-based sequence-to-sequence model to generate
Chinese Song iambics. Specifically, we encode the cue sentences by a
bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model and then predict the entire
iambic with the information provided by the encoder, in the form of an
attention-based LSTM that can regularize the generation process by the fine
structure of the input cues. Several techniques are investigated to improve the
model, including global context integration, hybrid style training, character
vector initialization and adaptation. Both the automatic and subjective
evaluation results show that our model indeed can learn the complex structural
and rhythmic patterns of Song iambics, and the generation is rather successful.

 <dc:description>  Dropped Pronouns (DP) in which pronouns are frequently dropped in the source
language but should be retained in the target language are challenge in machine
translation. In response to this problem, we propose a semi-supervised approach
to recall possibly missing pronouns in the translation. Firstly, we build
training data for DP generation in which the DPs are automatically labelled
according to the alignment information from a parallel corpus. Secondly, we
build a deep learning-based DP generator for input sentences in decoding when
no corresponding references exist. More specifically, the generation is
two-phase: (1) DP position detection, which is modeled as a sequential
labelling task with recurrent neural networks; and (2) DP prediction, which
employs a multilayer perceptron with rich features. Finally, we integrate the
above outputs into our translation system to recall missing pronouns by both
extracting rules from the DP-labelled training data and translating the
DP-generated input sentences. Experimental results show that our approach
achieves a significant improvement of 1.58 BLEU points in translation
performance with 66% F-score for DP generation accuracy.

 <dc:description>  We consider a frame-asynchronous coded slotted ALOHA (FA-CSA) system where
users become active according to a Poisson random process. In contrast to
standard frame-synchronous CSA (FS-CSA), users transmit a first replica of
their message in the slot following their activation and other replicas
uniformly at random in a number of subsequent slots. We derive the
(approximate) density evolution that characterizes the asymptotic performance
of FA-CSA when the frame length goes to infinity. We show that, if users can
monitor the system before they start transmitting, a boundary-effect similar to
that of spatially-coupled codes occurs, which greatly improves the decoding
threshold as compared to FS-CSA. We also derive analytical approximations of
the error floor (EF) in the finite frame length regime. We show that FA-CSA
yields in general lower EF, better performance in the waterfall region, and
lower average delay, as compared to FS-CSA.

 <dc:description>  There has been intensive work on the parameterized complexity of the
typically NP-hard task to edit undirected graphs into graphs fulfilling certain
given vertex degree constraints. In this work, we lift the investigations to
the case of directed graphs; herein, we focus on arc insertions. To this end,
our general two-stage framework consists of efficiently solving a
problem-specific number problem transferring its solution to a solution for the
graph problem by applying flow computations. In this way, we obtain
fixed-parameter tractability and polynomial kernelizability results, with the
central parameter being the maximum vertex in- or outdegree of the output
digraph. Although there are certain similarities with the much better studied
undirected case, the flow computation used in the directed case seems not to
work for the undirected case while f-factor computations as used in the
undirected case seem not to work for the directed case.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a deep neural network topology that incorporates a
simple to implement transformation invariant pooling operator (TI-POOLING).
This operator is able to efficiently handle prior knowledge on nuisance
variations in the data, such as rotation or scale changes. Most current methods
usually make use of dataset augmentation to address this issue, but this
requires larger number of model parameters and more training data, and results
in significantly increased training time and larger chance of under- or
overfitting. The main reason for these drawbacks is that the learned model
needs to capture adequate features for all the possible transformations of the
input. On the other hand, we formulate features in convolutional neural
networks to be transformation-invariant. We achieve that using parallel siamese
architectures for the considered transformation set and applying the TI-POOLING
operator on their outputs before the fully-connected layers. We show that this
topology internally finds the most optimal &quot;canonical&quot; instance of the input
image for training and therefore limits the redundancy in learned features.
This more efficient use of training data results in better performance on
popular benchmark datasets with smaller number of parameters when comparing to
standard convolutional neural networks with dataset augmentation and to other
baselines.

 <dc:description>  We present in this paper a simple, yet efficient convolutional neural network
(CNN) architecture for robust audio event recognition. Opposing to deep CNN
architectures with multiple convolutional and pooling layers topped up with
multiple fully connected layers, the proposed network consists of only three
layers: convolutional, pooling, and softmax layer. Two further features
distinguish it from the deep architectures that have been proposed for the
task: varying-size convolutional filters at the convolutional layer and 1-max
pooling scheme at the pooling layer. In intuition, the network tends to select
the most discriminative features from the whole audio signals for recognition.
Our proposed CNN not only shows state-of-the-art performance on the standard
task of robust audio event recognition but also outperforms other deep
architectures up to 4.5% in terms of recognition accuracy, which is equivalent
to 76.3% relative error reduction.

 <dc:description>  Judgment aggregation problems form a class of collective decision-making
problems represented in an abstract way, subsuming some well known problems
such as voting. A collective decision can be reached in many ways, but a direct
one-step aggregation of individual decisions is arguably most studied. Another
way to reach collective decisions is by iterative consensus building --
allowing each decision-maker to change their individual decision in response to
the choices of the other agents until a consensus is reached. Iterative
consensus building has so far only been studied for voting problems. Here we
propose an iterative judgment aggregation algorithm, based on movements in an
undirected graph, and we study for which instances it terminates with a
consensus. We also compare the computational complexity of our iterative
procedure with that of related judgment aggregation operators.

 <dc:description>  Universal schema jointly embeds knowledge bases and textual patterns to
reason about entities and relations for automatic knowledge base construction
and information extraction. In the past, entity pairs and relations were
represented as learned vectors with compatibility determined by a scoring
function, limiting generalization to unseen text patterns and entities.
Recently, 'column-less' versions of Universal Schema have used compositional
pattern encoders to generalize to all text patterns. In this work we take the
next step and propose a 'row-less' model of universal schema, removing explicit
entity pair representations. Instead of learning vector representations for
each entity pair in our training set, we treat an entity pair as a function of
its relation types. In experimental results on the FB15k-237 benchmark we
demonstrate that we can match the performance of a comparable model with
explicit entity pair representations using a model of attention over relation
types. We further demonstrate that the model per- forms with nearly the same
accuracy on entity pairs never seen during training.

 <dc:title>Perfect-Information Stochastic Games with Generalized Mean-Payoff

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Graph games provide the foundation for modeling and synthesizing reactive
processes. In the synthesis of stochastic reactive processes, the traditional
model is perfect-information stochastic games, where some transitions of the
game graph are controlled by two adversarial players, and the other transitions
are executed probabilistically. We consider such games where the objective is
the conjunction of several quantitative objectives (specified as mean-payoff
conditions), which we refer to as generalized mean-payoff objectives. The basic
decision problem asks for the existence of a finite-memory strategy for a
player that ensures the generalized mean-payoff objective be satisfied with a
desired probability against all strategies of the opponent. A special case of
the decision problem is the almost-sure problem where the desired probability
is 1. Previous results presented a semi-decision procedure for
epsilon-approximations of the almost-sure problem. In this work, we show that
both the almost-sure problem as well as the general basic decision problem are
coNP-complete, significantly improving the previous results. Moreover, we show
that in the case of 1-player stochastic games, randomized memoryless strategies
are sufficient and the problem can be solved in polynomial time. In contrast,
in two-player stochastic games, we show that even with randomized strategies
exponential memory is required in general, and present a matching exponential
upper bound. We also study the basic decision problem with infinite-memory
strategies and present computational complexity results for the problem. Our
results are relevant in the synthesis of stochastic reactive systems with
multiple quantitative requirements.

 <dc:description>  We consider a variant of the multiarmed bandit problem where jobs queue for
service, and service rates of different servers may be unknown. We study
algorithms that minimize queue-regret: the (expected) difference between the
queue-lengths obtained by the algorithm, and those obtained by a &quot;genie&quot;-aided
matching algorithm that knows exact service rates. A naive view of this problem
would suggest that queue-regret should grow logarithmically: since queue-regret
cannot be larger than classical regret, results for the standard MAB problem
give algorithms that ensure queue-regret increases no more than logarithmically
in time. Our paper shows surprisingly more complex behavior. In particular, the
naive intuition is correct as long as the bandit algorithm's queues have
relatively long regenerative cycles: in this case queue-regret is similar to
cumulative regret, and scales (essentially) logarithmically. However, we show
that this &quot;early stage&quot; of the queueing bandit eventually gives way to a &quot;late
stage&quot;, where the optimal queue-regret scaling is $O(1/t)$. We demonstrate an
algorithm that (order-wise) achieves this asymptotic queue-regret, and also
exhibits close to optimal switching time from the early stage to the late
stage.

 <dc:description>  Graph transformation systems have the potential to be realistic models of
chemistry, provided a comprehensive collection of reaction rules can be
extracted from the body of chemical knowledge. A first key step for rule
learning is the computation of atom-atom mappings, i.e., the atom-wise
correspondence between products and educts of all published chemical reactions.
This can be phrased as a maximum common edge subgraph problem with the
constraint that transition states must have cyclic structure. We describe a
search tree method well suited for small edit distance and an integer linear
program best suited for general instances and demonstrate that it is feasible
to compute atom-atom maps at large scales using a manually curated database of
biochemical reactions as an example. In this context we address the network
completion problem.

 <dc:description>  We present a logic that extends CTL (Computation Tree Logic) with operators
that express synchronization properties. A property is synchronized in a system
if it holds in all paths of a certain length. The new logic is obtained by
using the same path quantifiers and temporal operators as in CTL, but allowing
a different order of the quantifiers. This small syntactic variation induces a
logic that can express non-regular properties for which known extensions of MSO
with equality of path length are undecidable. We show that our variant of CTL
is decidable and that the model-checking problem is in Delta_3^P = P^{NP^NP},
and is DP-hard. We analogously consider quantifier exchange in extensions of
CTL, and we present operators defined using basic operators of CTL* that
express the occurrence of infinitely many synchronization points. We show that
the model-checking problem remains in Delta_3^P. The distinguishing power of
CTL and of our new logic coincide if the Next operator is allowed in the
logics, thus the classical bisimulation quotient can be used for state-space
reduction before model checking.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the task of recognizing human actions in realistic
video where human actions are dominated by irrelevant factors. We first study
the benefits of removing non-action video segments, which are the ones that do
not portray any human action. We then learn a non-action classifier and use it
to down-weight irrelevant video segments. The non-action classifier is trained
using ActionThread, a dataset with shot-level annotation for the occurrence or
absence of a human action. The non-action classifier can be used to identify
non-action shots with high precision and subsequently used to improve the
performance of action recognition systems.

 <dc:description>  This work introduces capacity limits for molecular timing (MT) channels,
where information is modulated on the release timing of small information
particles, and decoded from the time of arrival at the receiver. It is shown
that the random time of arrival can be represented as an additive noise
channel, and for the diffusion-based MT (DBMT) channel, this noise is
distributed according to the L\'evy distribution. Lower and upper bounds on the
capacity of the DBMT channel are derived for the case where the delay
associated with the propagation of information particles in the channel is
finite. These bounds are also shown to be tight.

 <dc:description>  The cost of deriving actionable knowledge from large datasets has been
decreasing thanks to a convergence of positive factors: low cost data
generation, inexpensively scalable storage and processing infrastructure
(cloud), software frameworks and tools for massively distributed data
processing, and parallelisable data analytics algorithms. One observation that
is often overlooked, however, is that each of these elements is not immutable,
rather they all evolve over time. This suggests that the value of such
derivative knowledge may decay over time, unless it is preserved by reacting to
those changes. Our broad research goal is to develop models, methods, and tools
for selectively reacting to changes by balancing costs and benefits, i.e.
through complete or partial re-computation of some of the underlying processes.
In this paper we present an initial model for reasoning about change and
re-computations, and show how analysis of detailed provenance of derived
knowledge informs re-computation decisions. We illustrate the main ideas
through a real-world case study in genomics, namely on the interpretation of
human variants in support of genetic diagnosis.

 <dc:description>  R is one of the most popular programming languages for statistics and machine
learning, but the R framework is relatively slow and unable to scale to large
datasets. The general approach for speeding up an implementation in R is to
implement the algorithms in C or FORTRAN and provide an R wrapper. FlashR takes
a different approach: it executes R code in parallel and scales the code beyond
memory capacity by utilizing solid-state drives (SSDs) automatically. It
provides a small number of generalized operations (GenOps) upon which we
reimplement a large number of matrix functions in the R base package. As such,
FlashR parallelizes and scales existing R code with little/no modification. To
reduce data movement between CPU and SSDs, FlashR evaluates matrix operations
lazily, fuses operations at runtime, and uses cache-aware, two-level matrix
partitioning. We evaluate FlashR on a variety of machine learning and
statistics algorithms on inputs of up to four billion data points. FlashR
out-of-core tracks closely the performance of FlashR in-memory. The R code for
machine learning algorithms executed in FlashR outperforms the in-memory
execution of H2O and Spark MLlib by a factor of 2-10 and outperforms Revolution
R Open by more than an order of magnitude.

 <dc:description>  Detection of hydroacoustic transmissions is a key enabling technology in
applications such as depth measurements, detection of objects, and undersea
mapping. To cope with the long channel delay spread and the low signal-to-noise
ratio, hydroacoustic signals are constructed with a large time-bandwidth
product, $N$. A promising detector for hydroacoustic signals is the normalized
matched filter (NMF). For the NMF, the detection threshold depends only on $N$,
thereby obviating the need to estimate the characteristics of the sea ambient
noise which are time-varying and hard to estimate. While previous works
analyzed the characteristics of the normalized matched filter (NMF), for
hydroacoustic signals with large $N$ values the expressions available are
computationally complicated to evaluate. Specifically for hydroacoustic signals
of large $N$ values, this paper presents approximations for the probability
distribution of the NMF. These approximations are found extremely accurate in
numerical simulations. We also outline a computationally efficient method to
calculate the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) which is required to
determine the detection threshold. Results from an experiment conducted in the
Mediterranean sea at depth of 900~m agree with the analysis.

 <dc:title>Analysis of the Entropy-guided Switching Trimmed Mean Deviation-based

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This report describes the experimental analysis of a proposed switching
filter-anisotropic diffusion hybrid for the filtering of the fixed value (salt
and pepper) impulse noise (FVIN). The filter works well at both low and high
noise densities though it was specifically designed for high noise density
levels. The filter combines the switching mechanism of decision-based filters
and the partial differential equation-based formulation to yield a powerful
system capable of recovering the image signals at very high noise levels.
Experimental results indicate that the filter surpasses other filters,
especially at very high noise levels. Additionally, its adaptive nature ensures
that the performance is guided by the metrics obtained from the noisy input
image. The filter algorithm is of both global and local nature, where the
former is chosen to reduce computation time and complexity, while the latter is
used for best results.

 <dc:description>  The permanent versus determinant conjecture is a major problem in complexity
theory that is equivalent to the separation of the complexity classes VP_{ws}
and VNP. Mulmuley and Sohoni (SIAM J. Comput., 2001) suggested to study a
strengthened version of this conjecture over the complex numbers that amounts
to separating the orbit closures of the determinant and padded permanent
polynomials. In that paper it was also proposed to separate these orbit
closures by exhibiting occurrence obstructions, which are irreducible
representations of GL_{n^2}(C), which occur in one coordinate ring of the orbit
closure, but not in the other. We prove that this approach is impossible.
However, we do not rule out the general approach to the permanent versus
determinant problem via multiplicity obstructions as proposed by Mulmuley and
Sohoni.

 <dc:description>  The way people look in terms of facial attributes (ethnicity, hair color,
facial hair, etc.) and the clothes or accessories they wear (sunglasses, hat,
hoodies, etc.) is highly dependent on geo-location and weather condition,
respectively. This work explores, for the first time, the use of this
contextual information, as people with wearable cameras walk across different
neighborhoods of a city, in order to learn a rich feature representation for
facial attribute classification, without the costly manual annotation required
by previous methods. By tracking the faces of casual walkers on more than 40
hours of egocentric video, we are able to cover tens of thousands of different
identities and automatically extract nearly 5 million pairs of images connected
by or from different face tracks, along with their weather and location
context, under pose and lighting variations. These image pairs are then fed
into a deep network that preserves similarity of images connected by the same
track, in order to capture identity-related attribute features, and optimizes
for location and weather prediction to capture additional facial attribute
features. Finally, the network is fine-tuned with manually annotated samples.
We perform an extensive experimental analysis on wearable data and two standard
benchmark datasets based on web images (LFWA and CelebA). Our method
outperforms by a large margin a network trained from scratch. Moreover, even
without using manually annotated identity labels for pre-training as in
previous methods, our approach achieves results that are better than the state
of the art.

 <dc:description>  The most common assumption in evolutionary game theory is that players should
adopt a strategy that warrants the highest payoff. However, recent studies
indicate that the spatial selection for cooperation is enhanced if an
appropriate fraction of the population chooses the most common rather than the
most profitable strategy within the interaction range. Such conformity might be
due to herding instincts or crowd behavior in humans and social animals. In a
heterogeneous population where individuals differ in their degree, collective
influence, or other traits, an unanswered question remains who should conform.
Selecting conformists randomly is the simplest choice, but it is neither a
realistic nor the optimal one. We show that, regardless of the source of
heterogeneity and game parametrization, socially the most favorable outcomes
emerge if the masses conform. On the other hand, forcing leaders to conform
significantly hinders the constructive interplay between heterogeneity and
coordination, leading to evolutionary outcomes that are worse still than if
conformists were chosen randomly. We conclude that leaders must be able to
create a following for network reciprocity to be optimally augmented by
conformity. In the opposite case, when leaders are castrated and made to
follow, the failure of coordination impairs the evolution of cooperation.

 <dc:description>  We study high-dimensional distribution learning in an agnostic setting where
an adversary is allowed to arbitrarily corrupt an $\varepsilon$-fraction of the
samples. Such questions have a rich history spanning statistics, machine
learning and theoretical computer science. Even in the most basic settings, the
only known approaches are either computationally inefficient or lose
dimension-dependent factors in their error guarantees. This raises the
following question:Is high-dimensional agnostic distribution learning even
possible, algorithmically?
  In this work, we obtain the first computationally efficient algorithms with
dimension-independent error guarantees for agnostically learning several
fundamental classes of high-dimensional distributions: (1) a single Gaussian,
(2) a product distribution on the hypercube, (3) mixtures of two product
distributions (under a natural balancedness condition), and (4) mixtures of
spherical Gaussians. Our algorithms achieve error that is independent of the
dimension, and in many cases scales nearly-linearly with the fraction of
adversarially corrupted samples. Moreover, we develop a general recipe for
detecting and correcting corruptions in high-dimensions, that may be applicable
to many other problems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study detection and fast reconstruction of the celebrated
Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world random graph model \citep{watts1998collective}
which aims to describe real-world complex networks that exhibit both high
clustering and short average length properties. The WS model with neighborhood
size $k$ and rewiring probability probability $\beta$ can be viewed as a
continuous interpolation between a deterministic ring lattice graph and the
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph. We study both the computational and
statistical aspects of detecting the deterministic ring lattice structure (or
local geographical links, strong ties) in the presence of random connections
(or long range links, weak ties), and for its recovery. The phase diagram in
terms of $(k,\beta)$ is partitioned into several regions according to the
difficulty of the problem. We propose distinct methods for the various regions.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel hashing-based matching scheme, called Locally Optimized
Hashing (LOH), based on a state-of-the-art quantization algorithm that can be
used for efficient, large-scale search, recommendation, clustering, and
deduplication. We show that matching with LOH only requires set intersections
and summations to compute and so is easily implemented in generic distributed
computing systems. We further show application of LOH to: a) large-scale search
tasks where performance is on par with other state-of-the-art hashing
approaches; b) large-scale recommendation where queries consisting of thousands
of images can be used to generate accurate recommendations from collections of
hundreds of millions of images; and c) efficient clustering with a graph-based
algorithm that can be scaled to massive collections in a distributed
environment or can be used for deduplication for small collections, like search
results, performing better than traditional hashing approaches while only
requiring a few milliseconds to run. In this paper we experiment on datasets of
up to 100 million images, but in practice our system can scale to larger
collections and can be used for other types of data that have a vector
representation in a Euclidean space.

 <dc:description>  The quality of user experience online is affected by the relevance and
placement of advertisements. We propose a new system for selecting and
displaying visual advertisements in image search result sets. Our method
compares the visual similarity of candidate ads to the image search results and
selects the most visually similar ad to be displayed. The method further
selects an appropriate location in the displayed image grid to minimize the
perceptual visual differences between the ad and its neighbors. We conduct an
experiment with about 900 users and find that our proposed method provides
significant improvement in the users' overall satisfaction with the image
search experience, without diminishing the users' ability to see the ad or
recall the advertised brand.

 <dc:description>  The capacity scaling of a Wi-Fi network with fixed transmit power is
investigated. The 802.11 MAC appears to impose a hard limit on the area
capacity by enforcing single transmissions in overlapped cell coverage areas.
However due to the difficulty reading the packet header when transmissions
either overlap or are faded, stations in different cells may lose
synchronization with each other. A large frequency planned network with full
propagation impairments of fast and slow fading is simulated in NS-3 with an
upgraded receiver model supporting packet capture. Downlink Wi-Fi performance
is compared to an equivalent LTE network on the same cell centers. Results show
that Wi-Fi downlink throughput grows with densification limited by decreasing
SINR and partially operational virtual carrier sense. LTE area capacity grows
faster as it is only constrained by SINR.

 <dc:title>On Stronger Calculi for QBFs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Egly, Uwe</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs) generalize propositional formulas by
admitting quantifications over propositional variables. QBFs can be viewed as
(restricted) formulas of first-order predicate logic and easy translations of
QBFs into first-order formulas exist. We analyze different translations and
show that first-order resolution combined with such translations can
polynomially simulate well-known deduction concepts for QBFs. Furthermore, we
extend QBF calculi by the possibility to instantiate a universal variable by an
existential variable of smaller level. Combining such an enhanced calculus with
the propositional extension rule results in a calculus with a universal
quantifier rule which essentially introduces propositional formulas for
universal variables. In this way, one can mimic a very general quantifier rule
known from sequent systems.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of selecting the best variable-value strategy for
solving a given problem in constraint programming. We show that the recent
Embarrassingly Parallel Search method (EPS) can be used for this purpose. EPS
proposes to solve a problem by decomposing it in a lot of subproblems and to
give them on-demand to workers which run in parallel. Our method uses a part of
these subproblems as a simple sample as defined in statistics for comparing
some strategies in order to select the most promising one that will be used for
solving the remaining subproblems. For each subproblem of the sample, the
parallelism helps us to control the running time of the strategies because it
gives us the possibility to introduce timeouts by stopping a strategy when it
requires more than twice the time of the best one. Thus, we can deal with the
great disparity in solving times for the strategies. The selections we made are
based on the Wilcoxon signed rank tests because no assumption has to be made on
the distribution of the solving times and because these tests can deal with the
censored data that we obtain after introducing timeouts. The experiments we
performed on a set of classical benchmarks for satisfaction and optimization
problems show that our method obtain good performance by selecting almost all
the time the best variable-value strategy and by almost never choosing a
variable-value strategy which is dramatically slower than the best one. Our
method also outperforms the portfolio approach consisting in running some
strategies in parallel and is competitive with the multi armed bandit
framework.

 <dc:description>  View-invariant object recognition is a challenging problem, which has
attracted much attention among the psychology, neuroscience, and computer
vision communities. Humans are notoriously good at it, even if some variations
are presumably more difficult to handle than others (e.g. 3D rotations). Humans
are thought to solve the problem through hierarchical processing along the
ventral stream, which progressively extracts more and more invariant visual
features. This feed-forward architecture has inspired a new generation of
bio-inspired computer vision systems called deep convolutional neural networks
(DCNN), which are currently the best algorithms for object recognition in
natural images. Here, for the first time, we systematically compared human
feed-forward vision and DCNNs at view-invariant object recognition using the
same images and controlling for both the kinds of transformation as well as
their magnitude. We used four object categories and images were rendered from
3D computer models. In total, 89 human subjects participated in 10 experiments
in which they had to discriminate between two or four categories after rapid
presentation with backward masking. We also tested two recent DCNNs on the same
tasks. We found that humans and DCNNs largely agreed on the relative
difficulties of each kind of variation: rotation in depth is by far the hardest
transformation to handle, followed by scale, then rotation in plane, and
finally position. This suggests that humans recognize objects mainly through 2D
template matching, rather than by constructing 3D object models, and that DCNNs
are not too unreasonable models of human feed-forward vision. Also, our results
show that the variation levels in rotation in depth and scale strongly modulate
both humans' and DCNNs' recognition performances. We thus argue that these
variations should be controlled in the image datasets used in vision research.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is commonly used for optimization in
large-scale machine learning problems. Langford et al. (2009) introduce a
sparse online learning method to induce sparsity via truncated gradient. With
high-dimensional sparse data, however, the method suffers from slow convergence
and high variance due to the heterogeneity in feature sparsity. To mitigate
this issue, we introduce a stabilized truncated stochastic gradient descent
algorithm. We employ a soft-thresholding scheme on the weight vector where the
imposed shrinkage is adaptive to the amount of information available in each
feature. The variability in the resulted sparse weight vector is further
controlled by stability selection integrated with the informative truncation.
To facilitate better convergence, we adopt an annealing strategy on the
truncation rate, which leads to a balanced trade-off between exploration and
exploitation in learning a sparse weight vector. Numerical experiments show
that our algorithm compares favorably with the original algorithm in terms of
prediction accuracy, achieved sparsity and stability.

 <dc:description>  We propose behavioral specification theories for most equivalences in the

theories focuses on bisimilarity, but there is a clear interest in
specification theories for other preorders and equivalences. We show that
specification theories for preorders cannot exist and develop a general scheme
which allows us to define behavioral specification theories, based on
disjunctive modal transition systems, for most equivalences in the
linear-time--branching-time spectrum.

 <dc:description>  In online action detection, the goal is to detect the start of an action in a
video stream as soon as it happens. For instance, if a child is chasing a ball,
an autonomous car should recognize what is going on and respond immediately.
This is a very challenging problem for four reasons. First, only partial
actions are observed. Second, there is a large variability in negative data.
Third, the start of the action is unknown, so it is unclear over what time
window the information should be integrated. Finally, in real world data, large
within-class variability exists. This problem has been addressed before, but
only to some extent. Our contributions to online action detection are
threefold. First, we introduce a realistic dataset composed of 27 episodes from
6 popular TV series. The dataset spans over 16 hours of footage annotated with
30 action classes, totaling 6,231 action instances. Second, we analyze and
compare various baseline methods, showing this is a challenging problem for
which none of the methods provides a good solution. Third, we analyze the
change in performance when there is a variation in viewpoint, occlusion,
truncation, etc. We introduce an evaluation protocol for fair comparison. The
dataset, the baselines and the models will all be made publicly available to
encourage (much needed) further research on online action detection on
realistic data.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles in problems with delayed rewards, and
one approach is to segment the task into sub-tasks with incremental rewards. We
propose a framework called Hierarchical Inverse Reinforcement Learning (HIRL),
which is a model for learning sub-task structure from demonstrations. HIRL
decomposes the task into sub-tasks based on transitions that are consistent
across demonstrations. These transitions are defined as changes in local
linearity w.r.t to a kernel function. Then, HIRL uses the inferred structure to
learn reward functions local to the sub-tasks but also handle any global
dependencies such as sequentiality.
  We have evaluated HIRL on several standard RL benchmarks: Parallel Parking
with noisy dynamics, Two-Link Pendulum, 2D Noisy Motion Planning, and a Pinball
environment. In the parallel parking task, we find that rewards constructed
with HIRL converge to a policy with an 80% success rate in 32% fewer time-steps
than those constructed with Maximum Entropy Inverse RL (MaxEnt IRL), and with
partial state observation, the policies learned with IRL fail to achieve this
accuracy while HIRL still converges. We further find that that the rewards
learned with HIRL are robust to environment noise where they can tolerate 1
stdev. of random perturbation in the poses in the environment obstacles while
maintaining roughly the same convergence rate. We find that HIRL rewards can
converge up-to 6x faster than rewards constructed with IRL.

 <dc:description>  We investigate properties of convergent and forward-closed string rewriting
systems in the context of the syntactic criteria introduced in
\cite{LynchMorawska} by Christopher Lynch and Barbara Morawska (we call these
$LM$-Systems). Since a string rewriting system can be viewed as a
term-rewriting system over a signature of purely monadic function symbols, we
adapt their definition to the string rewriting case. We prove that the
subterm-collapse problem for convergent and forward-closed string rewriting
systems is effectively solvable. Therefore, there exists a decision procedure
that verifies if such a system is an $LM$-System. We use the same construction
to prove that the \emph{cap problem} from the field of cryptographic protocol
analysis, which is undecidable for general $LM$-systems, is decidable when
restricted to the string rewriting case.

 <dc:description>  The problem of recovering a signal of finite duration from a piece of its
Fourier transform was solved at Bell Labs in the $1960$'s, by exploiting a
&quot;miracle&quot;: a certain naturally appearing integral operator commutes with an
explicit differential one. Here we show that this same miracle holds in a
matrix valued version of the same problem.

 <dc:description>  One of the most challenging problems in kernel online learning is to bound
the model size and to promote the model sparsity. Sparse models not only
improve computation and memory usage, but also enhance the generalization
capacity, a principle that concurs with the law of parsimony. However,
inappropriate sparsity modeling may also significantly degrade the performance.
In this paper, we propose Approximation Vector Machine (AVM), a model that can
simultaneously encourage the sparsity and safeguard its risk in compromising
the performance. When an incoming instance arrives, we approximate this
instance by one of its neighbors whose distance to it is less than a predefined
threshold. Our key intuition is that since the newly seen instance is expressed
by its nearby neighbor the optimal performance can be analytically formulated
and maintained. We develop theoretical foundations to support this intuition
and further establish an analysis to characterize the gap between the
approximation and optimal solutions. This gap crucially depends on the
frequency of approximation and the predefined threshold. We perform the
convergence analysis for a wide spectrum of loss functions including Hinge,
smooth Hinge, and Logistic for classification task, and $l_1$, $l_2$, and
$\epsilon$-insensitive for regression task. We conducted extensive experiments
for classification task in batch and online modes, and regression task in
online mode over several benchmark datasets. The results show that our proposed
AVM achieved a comparable predictive performance with current state-of-the-art
methods while simultaneously achieving significant computational speed-up due
to the ability of the proposed AVM in maintaining the model size.

 <dc:description>  Many graphics and vision problems can be expressed as non-linear least
squares optimizations of objective functions over visual data, such as images
and meshes. The mathematical descriptions of these functions are extremely
concise, but their implementation in real code is tedious, especially when
optimized for real-time performance on modern GPUs in interactive applications.
In this work, we propose a new language, Opt (available under
http://optlang.org), for writing these objective functions over image- or
graph-structured unknowns concisely and at a high level. Our compiler
automatically transforms these specifications into state-of-the-art GPU solvers
based on Gauss-Newton or Levenberg-Marquardt methods. Opt can generate
different variations of the solver, so users can easily explore tradeoffs in
numerical precision, matrix-free methods, and solver approaches. In our
results, we implement a variety of real-world graphics and vision applications.
Their energy functions are expressible in tens of lines of code, and produce
highly-optimized GPU solver implementations. These solver have performance
competitive with the best published hand-tuned, application-specific GPU
solvers, and orders of magnitude beyond a general-purpose auto-generated
solver.

 <dc:description>  We propose a transition-based dependency parser using Recurrent Neural
Networks with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. This extends the feedforward
neural network parser of Chen and Manning (2014) and enables modelling of
entire sequences of shift/reduce transition decisions. On the Google Web
Treebank, our LSTM parser is competitive with the best feedforward parser on
overall accuracy and notably achieves more than 3% improvement for long-range
dependencies, which has proved difficult for previous transition-based parsers
due to error propagation and limited context information. Our findings
additionally suggest that dropout regularisation on the embedding layer is
crucial to improve the LSTM's generalisation.

 <dc:title>The Synergistic Gains of Coded Caching and Delayed Feedback</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Jingjing</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Elia, Petros</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the $K$-user cache-aided wireless MISO broadcast
channel (BC) with random fading and delayed CSIT, and identify the optimal
cache-aided degrees-of-freedom (DoF) performance within a factor of 4. The
achieved performance is due to a scheme that combines basic coded-caching with
MAT-type schemes, and which efficiently exploits the prospective-hindsight
similarities between these two methods. This delivers a powerful synergy
between coded caching and delayed feedback, in the sense that the total
synergistic DoF-gain can be much larger than the sum of the individual gains
from delayed CSIT and from coded caching.
  The derived performance interestingly reveals --- for the first time ---
substantial DoF gains from coded caching, even when the (normalized) cache size
$\gamma$ (fraction of the library stored at each receiving device) is very
small. Specifically, a microscopic $\gamma \approx e^{-G}$ can come within a
factor of $G$ from the interference-free optimal. For example, storing at each
device only a \emph{thousandth} of what is deemed as `popular' content
($\gamma\approx 10^{-3}$), we approach the interference-free optimal within a
factor of $ln(10^3) \approx 7$ (per user DoF of $1/7$), for any number of
users. This result carries an additional practical ramification as it reveals
how to use coded caching to essentially buffer CSI, thus partially ameliorating
the burden of having to acquire real-time CSIT.

 <dc:description>  Generalized product codes (GPCs) are extensions of product codes (PCs) where
coded bits are protected by two component codes but not necessarily arranged in
a rectangular array. It has recently been shown that there exists a large class
of deterministic GPCs (including, e.g., irregular PCs, half-product codes,
staircase codes, and certain braided codes) for which the asymptotic
performance under iterative bounded-distance decoding over the binary erasure
channel (BEC) can be rigorously characterized in terms of a density evolution
analysis. In this paper, the analysis is extended to the case where
transmission takes place over parallel BECs with different erasure
probabilities. We use this model to predict the code performance in a coded
modulation setup with higher-order signal constellations. We also discuss the
design of the bit mapper that determines the allocation of the coded bits to
the modulation bits of the signal constellation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider folding assembly as an assembly primitive suitable
for dual-arm robotic assembly, that can be integrated in a higher level
assembly strategy. The system composed by two pieces in contact is modelled as
an articulated object, connected by a prismatic-revolute joint. Different
grasping scenarios were considered in order to model the system, and a simple
controller based on feedback linearisation is proposed, using force torque
measurements to compute the contact point kinematics. The folding assembly
controller has been experimentally tested with two sample parts, in order to
showcase folding assembly as a viable assembly primitive.

 <dc:description>  Random resolution, defined by Buss, Kolodziejczyk and Thapen (JSL, 2014), is
a sound propositional proof system that extends the resolution proof system by
the possibility to augment any set of initial clauses by a set of randomly
chosen clauses (modulo a technical condition). We show how to apply the general
feasible interpolation theorem for semantic derivations of Krajicek (JSL, 1997)
to random resolution. As a consequence we get a lower bound for random
resolution refutations of the clique-coloring formulas.

 <dc:description>  To recover simultaneous multiple failures in erasure coded storage systems,
Patrick Lee et al introduce concurrent repair based minimal storage
regenerating codes to reduce repair traffic. The architecture of this approach
is simpler and more practical than that of the cooperative mechanism in
non-fully distributed environment, hence this paper unifies such class of
regenerating codes as concurrent regenerating codes and further studies its
characteristics by analyzing cut-based information flow graph in the
multiple-node recovery model. We present a general storage-bandwidth tradeoff
and give closed-form expressions for the points on the curve, including
concurrent repair mechanism based on minimal bandwidth regenerating codes. We
show that the general concurrent regenerating codes can be constructed by
reforming the existing single-node regenerating codes or multiplenode
cooperative regenerating codes. Moreover, a connection to strong-MDS is also
analyzed. On the other respect, the application of RGC is hardly limited to
&quot;repairing&quot;. It is of great significance for &quot;scaling&quot;, a scenario where we
need to increase(decrease) nodes to upgrade(degrade) redundancy and
reliability. Thus, by clarifying the similarities and differences, we integrate
them into a unified model to adjust to the dynamic storage network.

 <dc:title>A Classifier-guided Approach for Top-down Salient Object Detection</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework for top-down salient object detection that
incorporates a tightly coupled image classification module. The classifier is
trained on novel category-aware sparse codes computed on object dictionaries
used for saliency modeling. A misclassification indicates that the
corresponding saliency model is inaccurate. Hence, the classifier selects
images for which the saliency models need to be updated. The category-aware
sparse coding produces better image classification accuracy as compared to
conventional sparse coding with a reduced computational complexity. A
saliency-weighted max-pooling is proposed to improve image classification,
which is further used to refine the saliency maps. Experimental results on
Graz-02 and PASCAL VOC-07 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of salient
object detection. Although the role of the classifier is to support salient
object detection, we evaluate its performance in image classification and also
illustrate the utility of thresholded saliency maps for image segmentation.

 <dc:title>Sum-Rate Analysis and Optimization of Self-Backhauling Based Full-Duplex
  Radio Access System</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this article, a radio access system with a self-backhauling full-duplex
access node serving legacy half-duplex mobile devices is studied and analyzed.
In particular, it is assumed that the access node is using the same center
frequency for all the transmissions, meaning that also the backhauling is done
using the same frequency resources as the uplink and downlink transmissions. It
is further assumed that the access node has a massive array to facilitate
efficient beamforming and self-interference nulling in its own receiver. As a
starting point, the signal model for the considered access node is first
derived, including all the transmitted and received signals within the cell.
This is then used as a basis for obtaining the sum-rate expressions, which
depict the overall rates experienced by the mobile users that are served by the
access node. In addition, the data rate for the bi-directional backhaul link is
also derived, since the access node must be able to backhaul itself wirelessly.
The maximum achievable sum-rate is then determined by numerically solving an
optimization problem constructed from the data rate expressions. The
full-duplex scheme is also compared to two alternative transmission schemes,
which perform all or some of the transmissions in half-duplex mode. The results
show that the full-duplex capability of the access node is beneficial for
maximizing the sum-rate, meaning that a simple half-duplex transmission scheme
is typically not optimal. In particular, the highest sum-rate is usually
provided by a relay type solution, where the access node acts as a full-duplex
relay between the mobiles and the backhaul node.

 <dc:description>  Recent applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) for human
action recognition in videos have proposed different solutions for
incorporating the appearance and motion information. We study a number of ways
of fusing ConvNet towers both spatially and temporally in order to best take
advantage of this spatio-temporal information. We make the following findings:
(i) that rather than fusing at the softmax layer, a spatial and temporal
network can be fused at a convolution layer without loss of performance, but
with a substantial saving in parameters; (ii) that it is better to fuse such
networks spatially at the last convolutional layer than earlier, and that
additionally fusing at the class prediction layer can boost accuracy; finally
(iii) that pooling of abstract convolutional features over spatiotemporal
neighbourhoods further boosts performance. Based on these studies we propose a
new ConvNet architecture for spatiotemporal fusion of video snippets, and
evaluate its performance on standard benchmarks where this architecture
achieves state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:title>Feed-Forward Staircase Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Lei M.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose two variants of staircase codes that resolve the issue of
parity-propagation in their encoding process. The proposed codes provide a
systematic way of terminating a staircase code after an arbitrary number of
blocks. The class of feed-forward staircase codes are introduced, which uses a
self-protection technique to avoid parity-propagation. We also introduce the
class of partial feed-forward staircase codes, which allows parity-propagation
to occur over a given number of blocks. By amortizing the complexity of
self-protection over several standard staircase blocks, the encoding complexity
of these codes is made comparable to staircase codes. Partial feed-forward
staircase codes have the same error-floor as staircase codes. Simulations
confirm that the performance of the proposed codes in both the waterfall and
error-floor regions is similar to the original staircase codes. The proposed
codes help extend the domain of application of staircase codes to systems in
which parity-propagation is undesirable or termination is necessary.

 <dc:description>  Mobile phone data have recently become an attractive source of information
about mobility behavior. Since cell phone data can be captured in a passive way
for a large user population, they can be harnessed to collect well-sampled
mobility information. In this paper, we propose CT-Mapper, an unsupervised
algorithm that enables the mapping of mobile phone traces over a multimodal
transport network. One of the main strengths of CT-Mapper is its capability to
map noisy sparse cellular multimodal trajectories over a multilayer
transportation network where the layers have different physical properties and
not only to map trajectories associated with a single layer. Such a network is
modeled by a large multilayer graph in which the nodes correspond to
metro/train stations or road intersections and edges correspond to connections
between them. The mapping problem is modeled by an unsupervised HMM where the
observations correspond to sparse user mobile trajectories and the hidden
states to the multilayer graph nodes. The HMM is unsupervised as the transition
and emission probabilities are inferred using respectively the physical
transportation properties and the information on the spatial coverage of
antenna base stations. To evaluate CT-Mapper we collected cellular traces with
their corresponding GPS trajectories for a group of volunteer users in Paris
and vicinity (France). We show that CT-Mapper is able to accurately retrieve
the real cell phone user paths despite the sparsity of the observed trace
trajectories. Furthermore our transition probability model is up to 20% more
accurate than other naive models.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by the practical constraints arising in emerging sensor network and
Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, the zero-delay transmission of a
Gaussian measurement over a real single-input multiple-output (SIMO) additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is studied with a low-resolution
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) front end. Joint optimization of the encoder
and the decoder mapping is tackled under both the mean squared error (MSE)
distortion and the distortion outage probability (DOP) criteria, with an
average power constraint on the channel input. Optimal encoder and decoder
mappings are identified for a one-bit ADC front end under both criteria. For
the MSE distortion, the optimal encoder mapping is shown to be non-linear in
general, while it tends to a linear encoder in the low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) regime, and to an antipodal digital encoder in the high SNR regime. This
is in contrast to the optimality of linear encoding at all SNR values in the
presence of a full-precision front end. For the DOP criterion, it is shown that
the optimal encoder mapping is piecewise constant and can take only two
opposite values when it is non-zero. For both the MSE distortion and the DOP
criteria, necessary optimality conditions are then derived for $K$-level ADC
front ends as well as front ends with multiple one-bit ADCs. These conditions
are used to obtain numerically optimized solutions. Extensive numerical results
are also provided in order to gain insights into the structure of the optimal
encoding and decoding mappings.

 <dc:title>The Menu-Size Complexity of Revenue Approximation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider a monopolist that is selling $n$ items to a single additive
buyer, where the buyer's values for the items are drawn according to
independent distributions $F_1, F_2,\ldots,F_n$ that possibly have unbounded
support. It is well known that - unlike in the single item case - the
revenue-optimal auction (a pricing scheme) may be complex, sometimes requiring
a continuum of menu entries. It is also known that simple auctions with a
finite bounded number of menu entries can extract a constant fraction of the
optimal revenue. Nonetheless, the question of the possibility of extracting an
arbitrarily high fraction of the optimal revenue via a finite menu size
remained open.
  In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this open question, showing
that for every $n$ and for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there exists a complexity
bound $C=C(n,\varepsilon)$ such that auctions of menu size at most $C$ suffice
for obtaining a $(1-\varepsilon)$ fraction of the optimal revenue from any
$F_1,\ldots,F_n$. We prove upper and lower bounds on the revenue approximation
complexity $C(n,\varepsilon)$, as well as on the deterministic communication
complexity required to run an auction that achieves such an approximation.

 <dc:title>DISSECT-CF: a simulator to foster energy-aware scheduling in

 <dc:description>  Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) systems offer on demand virtual
infrastructures so reliably and flexibly that users expect a high service
level. Therefore, even with regards to internal IaaS behaviour, production
clouds only adopt novel ideas that are proven not to hinder established service
levels. To analyse their expected behaviour, new ideas are often evaluated with
simulators in production IaaS system-like scenarios. For instance, new research
could enable collaboration amongst several layers of schedulers or could
consider new optimisation objectives such as energy consumption. Unfortunately,
current cloud simulators are hard to employ and they often have performance
issues when several layers of schedulers interact in them. To target these
issues, a new IaaS simulation framework (called DISSECT-CF) was designed. The
new simulator's foundation has the following goals: easy extensibility, support
energy evaluation of IaaSs and to enable fast evaluation of many scheduling and
IaaS internal behaviour related scenarios. In response to the requirements of
such scenarios, the new simulator introduces concepts such as: a unified model
for resource sharing and a new energy metering framework with hierarchical and
indirect metering options. Then, the comparison of several simulated situations
to real-life IaaS behaviour is used to validate the simulator's functionality.
Finally, a performance comparison is presented between DISSECT-CF and some
currently available simulators.

matrix, limited in capturing linear mutual dependencies between variables only.
We present a rigorous and principled mathematical pipeline to recover the
kernel trick for computing the covariance matrix, enhancing it to model more
complex, non-linear relationships conveyed by the raw data. To this end, we
propose Kernelized-COV, which generalizes the original covariance
representation without compromising the efficiency of the computation. In the
experiments, we validate the proposed framework against many previous
approaches in the literature, scoring on par or superior with respect to the
state of the art on benchmark datasets for 3D action recognition.

 <dc:description>  We present a new resource for Swedish, SweLL, a corpus of Swedish Learner
essays linked to learners' performance according to the Common European
Framework of Reference (CEFR). SweLL consists of three subcorpora - SpIn,
SW1203 and Tisus, collected from three different educational establishments.
The common metadata for all subcorpora includes age, gender, native languages,
time of residence in Sweden, type of written task. Depending on the subcorpus,
learner texts may contain additional information, such as text genres, topics,
grades. Five of the six CEFR levels are represented in the corpus: A1, A2, B1,
B2 and C1 comprising in total 339 essays. C2 level is not included since
courses at C2 level are not offered. The work flow consists of collection of
essays and permits, essay digitization and registration, meta-data annotation,
automatic linguistic annotation. Inter-rater agreement is presented on the
basis of SW1203 subcorpus. The work on SweLL is still ongoing with more than
100 essays waiting in the pipeline. This article both describes the resource
and the &quot;how-to&quot; behind the compilation of SweLL.

 <dc:description>  Next generation mobile networks will rely ever more heavily on resource
sharing. In this article we study the sharing of radio access network and
spectrum among mobile operators. We assess the impact of sharing these two
types of resources on the performance of spatially distributed mobile networks.
We apply stochastic geometry to observe the combined effect of, for example,
the level of spatial clustering among the deployed base stations, the shared
network size, or the coordination in shared spectrum use on network coverage
and expected user data rate. We uncover some complex effects of mobile network
resource sharing, which involve non-linearly scaling gains and performance
trade-offs related to the sharing scenario or the spatial clustering level.

 <dc:title>A Class of Nonconvex Penalties Preserving Overall Convexity in

 <dc:description>  $\ell_1$ mean filtering is a conventional, optimization-based method to
estimate the positions of jumps in a piecewise constant signal perturbed by
additive noise. In this method, the $\ell_1$ norm penalizes sparsity of the
first-order derivative of the signal. Theoretical results, however, show that
in some situations, which can occur frequently in practice, even when the jump
amplitudes tend to $\infty$, the conventional method identifies false change
points. This issue is referred to as stair-casing problem and restricts
practical importance of $\ell_1$ mean filtering. In this paper, sparsity is
penalized more tightly than the $\ell_1$ norm by exploiting a certain class of
nonconvex functions, while the strict convexity of the consequent optimization
problem is preserved. This results in a higher performance in detecting change
points. To theoretically justify the performance improvements over $\ell_1$
mean filtering, deterministic and stochastic sufficient conditions for exact
change point recovery are derived. In particular, theoretical results show that
in the stair-casing problem, our approach might be able to exclude the false
change points, while $\ell_1$ mean filtering may fail. A number of numerical
simulations assist to show superiority of our method over $\ell_1$ mean
filtering and another state-of-the-art algorithm that promotes sparsity tighter
than the $\ell_1$ norm. Specifically, it is shown that our approach can
consistently detect change points when the jump amplitudes become sufficiently
large, while the two other competitors cannot.

 <dc:title>On Number Conservation of Non-uniform Cellular Automata</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies the number conservation property of 1-dimensional
non-uniform cellular automata (CAs). In a non-uniform cellular automaton (CA),
different cells may follow different rules. The present work considers that the
cells follow Wolfram's CAs rules. A characterization tool, named Reachability
tree is used to discover the number conservation property of non-uniform CAs.
Then a decision algorithm is reported to conclude whether a given non-uniform
CA with $n$ cells is number conserving or not. Finally, a synthesis scheme is
developed to get an $n$-cell number conserving non-uniform CA.

 <dc:title>Clustering with Missing Features: A Penalized Dissimilarity Measure

 <dc:description>  Many real-world clustering problems are plagued by incomplete data
characterized by missing or absent features for some or all of the data
instances. Traditional clustering methods cannot be directly applied to such
data without preprocessing by imputation or marginalization techniques. In this
article, we put forth the concept of Penalized Dissimilarity Measures which
estimate the actual distance between two data points (the distance between them
if they were to be fully observed) by adding a penalty to the distance due to
the observed features common to both the instances. We then propose such a
dissimilarity measure called the Feature Weighted Penalty based Dissimilarity
(FWPD) measure. Using the proposed dissimilarity measure, we also modify the
traditional k-means clustering algorithm and the standard hierarchical
agglomerative clustering techniques so as to make them directly applicable to
datasets with missing features. We present time complexity analyses for these
new techniques and also present a detailed analysis showing that the new FWPD
based k-means algorithm converges to a local optimum within a finite number of
iterations. We have also conducted extensive experiments on various benchmark
datasets showing that the proposed clustering techniques have generally better
results compared to some of the popular imputation methods which are commonly
used to handle such incomplete data. We have appended a possible extension of
the proposed dissimilarity measure to the case of absent features (where the
unobserved features are known to be non-existent).

 <dc:description>  Variation graphs, which represent genetic variation within a population, are
replacing sequences as reference genomes. Path indexes are one of the most
important tools for working with variation graphs. They generalize text indexes
to graphs, allowing one to find the paths matching the query string. We propose
using de Bruijn graphs as path indexes, compressing them by merging redundant
subgraphs, and encoding them with the Burrows-Wheeler transform. The resulting
fast, space-efficient, and versatile index is used in the variation graph
toolkit vg.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There has been a variety of crossover operators proposed for Real-Coded
Genetic Algorithms (RCGAs), which recombine values from the same location in
pairs of strings. In this article we present a recombination operator for RC-
GAs that selects the locations randomly in both parents, and compare it to
mainstream crossover operators in a set of experiments on a range of standard
multidimensional optimization problems and a clustering problem. We present two
variants of the operator, either selecting both bits uniformly at random in the
strings, or sampling the second bit from a normal distribution centered at the
selected location in the first string. While the operator is biased towards
exploitation of fitness space, the random selection of the second bit for swap-
ping makes it slightly less exploitation-biased. Extensive statistical analysis
using a non-parametric test shows the advantage of the new recombination
operators on a range of test functions.

 <dc:title>Agenda Separability in Judgment Aggregation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the better studied properties for operators in judgment aggregation is
independence, which essentially dictates that the collective judgment on one
issue should not depend on the individual judgments given on some other
issue(s) in the same agenda. Independence, although considered a desirable
property, is too strong, because together with mild additional conditions it
implies dictatorship. We propose here a weakening of independence, named agenda
separability: a judgment aggregation rule satisfies it if, whenever the agenda
is composed of several independent sub-agendas, the resulting collective
judgment sets can be computed separately for each sub-agenda and then put
together. We show that this property is discriminant, in the sense that among
judgment aggregation rules so far studied in the literature, some satisfy it
and some do not. We briefly discuss the implications of agenda separability on
the computation of judgment aggregation rules.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new framework for a descriptive complexity approach to
arithmetic computations. We define a hierarchy of classes based on the idea of
counting assignments to free function variables in first-order formulae. We
completely determine the inclusion structure and show that #P and #AC^0 appear
as classes of this hierarchy. In this way, we unconditionally place #AC^0
properly in a strict hierarchy of arithmetic classes within #P. We compare our
classes with a hierarchy within #P defined in a model-theoretic way by Saluja
et al. We argue that our approach is better suited to study arithmetic circuit
classes such as #AC^0 which can be descriptively characterized as a class in
our framework.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the problem of content-based image retrieval. In this
problem, the most popular performance measure is the top precision measure, and
the most important component of a retrieval system is the similarity function
used to compare a query image against a database image. However, up to now,
there is no existing similarity learning method proposed to optimize the top
precision measure. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel
similarity learning method to maximize the top precision measure. We model this
problem as a minimization problem with an objective function as the combination
of the losses of the relevant images ranked behind the top-ranked irrelevant
image, and the squared Frobenius norm of the similarity function parameter.
This minimization problem is solved as a quadratic programming problem. The
experiments over two benchmark data sets show the advantages of the proposed
method over other similarity learning methods when the top precision is used as
the performance measure.

 <dc:description>  To devise efficient solutions for approximating a mean partition in consensus
clustering, Dimitriadou et al. [3] presented a necessary condition of
optimality for a consensus function based on least square distances. We show
that their result is pivotal for deriving interesting properties of consensus
clustering beyond optimization. For this, we present the necessary condition of
optimality in a slightly stronger form in terms of the Mean Partition Theorem
and extend it to the Expected Partition Theorem. To underpin its versatility,
we show three examples that apply the Mean Partition Theorem: (i) equivalence
of the mean partition and optimal multiple alignment, (ii) construction of
profiles and motifs, and (iii) relationship between consensus clustering and
cluster stability.

flow that already proved to be a powerful tool in image processing and
graphics, to the case of undirected and weighted networks. The application of
the proposed method on peer-to-peer networks yields insights into topological
properties and the structure of their underlying data.

 <dc:description>  Recently, the long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) has attracted wide
interest due to its success in many tasks. LSTM architecture consists of a
memory cell and three gates, which looks similar to the neuronal networks in
the brain. However, there still lacks the evidence of the cognitive
plausibility of LSTM architecture as well as its working mechanism. In this
paper, we study the cognitive plausibility of LSTM by aligning its internal
architecture with the brain activity observed via fMRI when the subjects read a
story. Experiment results show that the artificial memory vector in LSTM can
accurately predict the observed sequential brain activities, indicating the
correlation between LSTM architecture and the cognitive process of story
reading.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we describe Compact-Table (CT), a bitwise algorithm to enforce
Generalized Arc Consistency (GAC) on table con- straints. Although this
algorithm is the default propagator for table constraints in or-tools and
OscaR, two publicly available CP solvers, it has never been described so far.
Importantly, CT has been recently improved further with the introduction of
residues, resetting operations and a data-structure called reversible sparse
bit-set, used to maintain tables of supports (following the idea of tabular
reduction): tuples are invalidated incrementally on value removals by means of
bit-set operations. The experimentation that we have conducted with OscaR shows

 <dc:description>  Regular expressions are often ambiguous. We present a novel method based on
Brzozowski's derivatives to aid the user in diagnosing ambiguous regular
expressions. We introduce a derivative-based finite state transducer to
generate parse trees and minimal counter-examples. The transducer can be easily
customized to either follow the POSIX or Greedy disambiguation policy and based
on a finite set of examples it is possible to examine if there are any
differences among POSIX and Greedy.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce a new method for text detection in natural images.
The method comprises two contributions: First, a fast and scalable engine to
generate synthetic images of text in clutter. This engine overlays synthetic
text to existing background images in a natural way, accounting for the local
3D scene geometry. Second, we use the synthetic images to train a
Fully-Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN) which efficiently performs text
detection and bounding-box regression at all locations and multiple scales in
an image. We discuss the relation of FCRN to the recently-introduced YOLO
detector, as well as other end-to-end object detection systems based on deep
learning. The resulting detection network significantly out performs current
methods for text detection in natural images, achieving an F-measure of 84.2%
on the standard ICDAR 2013 benchmark. Furthermore, it can process 15 images per
second on a GPU.

 <dc:creator>Gordeev, Denis</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of aggression for Internet communities is rampant. Anonymous
forums usually called imageboards are notorious for their aggressive and
deviant behaviour even in comparison with other Internet communities. This
study is aimed at studying ways of automatic detection of verbal expression of
aggression for the most popular American (4chan.org) and Russian (2ch.hk)
imageboards. A set of 1,802,789 messages was used for this study. The machine
learning algorithm word2vec was applied to detect the state of aggression. A
decent result is obtained for English (88%), the results for Russian are yet to
be improved.

 <dc:description>  In biomedical imaging reliable segmentation of objects (e.g. from small cells
up to large organs) is of fundamental importance for automated medical
diagnosis. New approaches for multi-scale segmentation can considerably improve
performance in case of natural variations in intensity, size and shape. This
paper aims at segmenting objects of interest based on shape contours and
automatically finding multiple objects with different scales. The overall
strategy of this work is to combine nonlinear segmentation with scales spaces
and spectral decompositions recently introduced in literature. For this we
generalize a variational segmentation model based on total variation using
Bregman distances to construct an inverse scale space. This offers the new
model to be accomplished by a scale analysis approach based on a spectral
decomposition of the total variation. As a result we obtain a very efficient,
(nearly) parameter-free multiscale segmentation method that comes with an
adaptive regularization parameter choice. The added benefit of our method is
demonstrated by systematic synthetic tests and its usage in a new biomedical
toolbox for identifying and classifying circulating tumor cells. Due to the
nature of nonlinear diffusion underlying, the mathematical concepts in this
work offer promising extensions to nonlocal classification problems.

(where N is the total size of the vector in d dimensions and R is the number of
nonzeros). It is stable to low-level noise and exhibits an exponentially small

 <dc:title>Evaluating Journal Quality: A Review of Journal Citation Indicators and

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Evaluating the quality of academic journal is becoming increasing important
within the context of research performance evaluation. Traditionally, journals
have been ranked by peer review lists such as that of the Association of
Business Schools (UK) or though their journal impact factor (JIF). However,
several new indicators have been developed, such as the h-index, SJR, SNIP and
the Eigenfactor which take into account different factors and therefore have
their own particular biases. In this paper we evaluate these metrics both
theoretically and also through an empirical study of a large set of business
and management journals. We show that even though the indicators appear highly
correlated in fact they lead to large differences in journal rankings. We
contextualize our results in terms of the UK's large scale research assessment
exercise (the RAE/REF) and particularly the ABS journal ranking list. We
conclude that no one indicator is superior but that the h-index (which includes
the productivity of a journal) and SNIP (which aims to normalize for field
effects) may be the most effective at the moment.

 <dc:title>Faster Average Case Low Memory Semi-External Construction of the
  Burrows-Wheeler Transform</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tischler, German</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Burrows Wheeler transform has applications in data compression as well as
full text indexing. Despite its important applications and various existing
algorithmic approaches the construction of the transform for large data sets is
still challenging. In this paper we present a new semi external memory
algorithm for constructing the Burrows Wheeler transform. It is capable of
constructing the transform for an input text of length $n$ over a finite
alphabet in time $O(n\log^2\log n)$ on average, if sufficient internal memory
is available to hold a fixed fraction of the input text. In the worst case the
run-time is $O(n\log n \log\log n)$. The amount of space used by the algorithm
in external memory is $O(n)$ bits. Based on the serial version we also present
a shared memory parallel algorithm running in time
$O(\frac{n}{p}\max\{\log^2\log n+\log p\})$ on average when $p$ processors are
available.

 <dc:description>  Environmental, economical and technical benefits of photovoltaic (PV) systems
make them to be used in many countries. The main characteristic of PV systems
is the fluctuations of their output power. Hence, high penetration of PV
systems into electric network could be detrimental to overall system
performance. Furthermore, the fluctuations in the output power of PV systems
make it difficult to predict their output, and to consider them in generation
planning of the units. The main objective of this paper is to propose a hybrid
method which can be used to control and reduce the power fluctuations generated
from large grid- connected PV systems. The proposed method focuses on using a
suitable storage battery along with curtailment of the generated power by
operating the PV system below the maximum power point (MPP) and deployment of a
diesel generator. These methods are analyzed to investigate the impacts of
implementing them on the economical benefits that the PV system owner could
gain. To maximize the revenues, an optimization problem is solved.

 <dc:title>BlockQuicksort: How Branch Mispredictions don't affect Quicksort</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Edelkamp, Stefan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Wei&#xdf;, Armin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Since the work of Kaligosi and Sanders (2006), it is well-known that
Quicksort -- which is commonly considered as one of the fastest in-place
sorting algorithms -- suffers in an essential way from branch mispredictions.
We present a novel approach to address this problem by partially decoupling
control from data flow: in order to perform the partitioning, we split the
input in blocks of constant size (we propose 128 data elements); then, all
elements in one block are compared with the pivot and the outcomes of the
comparisons are stored in a buffer. In a second pass, the respective elements
are rearranged. By doing so, we avoid conditional branches based on outcomes of
comparisons at all (except for the final Insertionsort). Moreover, we prove
that for a static branch predictor the average total number of branch
mispredictions is at most $\epsilon n \log n + O(n)$ for some small $\epsilon$
depending on the block size when sorting $n$ elements.
  Our experimental results are promising: when sorting random integer data, we
achieve an increase in speed of 80% over the GCC implementation of C++
std::sort. Also for many other types of data and non-random inputs, there is
still a significant speedup over std::sort. Only in few special cases like
sorted or almost sorted inputs, std::sort can beat out implementation.
Moreover, even on random input permutations, our implementation is even
slightly faster than an implementation of the highly tuned Super Scalar Sample
Sort, which uses a linear amount of additional space.

 <dc:description>  Empirical game-theoretic analysis (EGTA) has recently been applied
successfully to analyze the behavior of large numbers of competing traders in a
continuous double auction market. Multiagent simulation methods like EGTA are
useful for studying complex strategic environments like a stock market, where
it is not feasible to solve analytically for the rational behavior of each
agent. A weakness of simulation-based methods in strategic settings, however,
is that it is typically impossible to prove that the strategy profile assigned
to the simulated agents is stable, as in a Nash equilibrium. I propose using
reinforcement learning to analyze the regret of supposed Nash-equilibrium
strategy profiles found by EGTA. I have developed a new library of
reinforcement learning tools, which I have integrated into an extended version
of the market simulator from our prior work. I provide evidence for the
effectiveness of our library methods, both on a suite of benchmark problems
from the literature, and on non-equilibrium strategy profiles in our market
environment. Finally, I use our new reinforcement learning tools to provide
evidence that the equilibria found by EGTA in our recent continuous double
auction study are likely to have only negligible regret, even with respect to
an extended strategy space.

 <dc:description>  Artificial Immune Systems(AIS) have been widely used in different fields,
such as control, robotics, computer science and multi-agent systems. In this
paper is proposed a new approach of neural immune PD type tracking control
combining artificial immune control with neural network. It is assumed that the
output of the helper T-cell is concerned with not only the error of system but
also its changing rate, while the output of suppressor T-cell is unknown
nonlinear function with respect to the amount and changing rate of antigens and
the changing rate of antibodies, which is approximated by the output of neural
network. From this, we derive neural immune PD type control law and apply it to

method is verified by simulation and the simulation results show that this
method can follow the desired trajectory more rapidly and more accurately

 <dc:title>Parameterized Compilation Lower Bounds for Restricted CNF-formulas</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mengel, Stefan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show unconditional parameterized lower bounds in the area of knowledge
compilation, more specifically on the size of circuits in decomposable negation
normal form (DNNF) that encode CNF-formulas restricted by several graph width
measures. In particular, we show that
  - there are CNF formulas of size $n$ and modular incidence treewidth $k$
whose smallest DNNF-encoding has size $n^{\Omega(k)}$, and
  - there are CNF formulas of size $n$ and incidence neighborhood diversity $k$
whose smallest DNNF-encoding has size $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{k})}$.
  These results complement recent upper bounds for compiling CNF into DNNF and
strengthen---quantitatively and qualitatively---known conditional low\-er
bounds for cliquewidth. Moreover, they show that, unlike for many graph
problems, the parameters considered here behave significantly differently from
treewidth.

 <dc:description>  We present a method for learning discriminative filters using a shallow
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We encode rotation invariance directly in
the model by tying the weights of groups of filters to several rotated versions
of the canonical filter in the group. These filters can be used to extract
rotation invariant features well-suited for image classification. We test this
learning procedure on a texture classification benchmark, where the
orientations of the training images differ from those of the test images. We
obtain results comparable to the state-of-the-art. Compared to standard shallow
CNNs, the proposed method obtains higher classification performance while
reducing by an order of magnitude the number of parameters to be learned.

 <dc:description>  We develop a natural language interface for human robot interaction that
implements reasoning about deep semantics in natural language. To realize the
required deep analysis, we employ methods from cognitive linguistics, namely
the modular and compositional framework of Embodied Construction Grammar (ECG)
[Feldman, 2009]. Using ECG, robots are able to solve fine-grained reference
resolution problems and other issues related to deep semantics and
compositionality of natural language. This also includes verbal interaction
with humans to clarify commands and queries that are too ambiguous to be
executed safely. We implement our NLU framework as a ROS package and present
proof-of-concept scenarios with different robots, as well as a survey on the
state of the art.

 <dc:title>An improved chromosome formulation for genetic algorithms applied to

 <dc:description>  Genetic algorithms are a well-known method for tackling the problem of
variable selection. As they are non-parametric and can use a large variety of
fitness functions, they are well-suited as a variable selection wrapper that
can be applied to many different models. In almost all cases, the chromosome
formulation used in these genetic algorithms consists of a binary vector of
length n for n potential variables indicating the presence or absence of the
corresponding variables. While the aforementioned chromosome formulation has
exhibited good performance for relatively small n, there are potential problems
when the size of n grows very large, especially when interaction terms are
considered. We introduce a modification to the standard chromosome formulation
that allows for better scalability and model sparsity when interaction terms
are included in the predictor search space. Experimental results show that the
indexed chromosome formulation demonstrates improved computational efficiency
and sparsity on high-dimensional datasets with interaction terms compared to
the standard chromosome formulation.

 <dc:description>  ICU mortality scoring systems attempt to predict patient mortality using
predictive models with various clinical predictors. Examples of such systems
are APACHE, SAPS and MPM. However, most such scoring systems do not actively
look for and include interaction terms, despite physicians intuitively taking
such interactions into account when making a diagnosis. One barrier to
including such terms in predictive models is the difficulty of using most
variable selection methods in high-dimensional datasets. A genetic algorithm
framework for variable selection with logistic regression models is used to
search for two-way interaction terms in a clinical dataset of adult ICU
patients, with separate models being built for each category of diagnosis upon
admittance to the ICU. The models had good discrimination across all
categories, with a weighted average AUC of 0.84 (&gt;0.90 for several categories)
and the genetic algorithm was able to find several significant interaction
terms, which may be able to provide greater insight into mortality prediction
for health practitioners. The GA selected models had improved performance
against stepwise selection and random forest models, and provides greater
flexibility in terms of variable selection by being able to optimize over any
modeler-defined model performance metric instead of a specific variable
importance metric.

 <dc:description>  Sudden failure of a single transmission element in a power grid can induce a
domino effect of cascading failures, which can lead to the isolation of a large
number of consumers or even to the failure of the entire grid. Here we present
results of the simulation of cascading failures in power grids, using an
alternating current (AC) model. We first apply this model to a regular square
grid topology. For a random placement of consumers and generators on the grid,
the probability to find more than a certain number of unsupplied consumers
decays as a power law and obeys a scaling law with respect to system size.
Varying the transmitted power threshold above which a transmission line fails
does not seem to change the power law exponent $q \approx 1.6$. Furthermore, we
study the influence of the placement of generators and consumers on the number
of affected consumers and demonstrate that large clusters of generators and
consumers are especially vulnerable to cascading failures. As a real-world
topology we consider the German high-voltage transmission grid. Applying the
dynamic AC model and considering a random placement of consumers, we find that
the probability to disconnect more than a certain number of consumers depends
strongly on the threshold. For large thresholds the decay is clearly
exponential, while for small ones the decay is slow, indicating a power law
decay.

 <dc:description>  Most work on the verification of concurrent objects for shared memory assumes
sequential consistency, but most multicore processors support only weak memory
models that do not provide sequential consistency. Furthermore, most
verification efforts focus on the linearizability of concurrent objects, but
there are existing implementations optimized to run on weak memory models that
are not linearizable.
  In this paper, we address these problems by introducing causal
linearizability, a correctness condition for concurrent objects running on weak
memory models. Like linearizability itself, causal linearizability enables
concurrent objects to be composed, under weak constraints on the client's
behaviour. We specify these constraints by introducing a notion of
operation-race freedom, where programs that satisfy this property are
guaranteed to behave as if their shared objects were in fact linearizable.
  We apply these ideas to objects from the Linux kernel, optimized to run on
TSO, the memory model of the x86 processor family.

 <dc:title>Entity Embeddings of Categorical Variables</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Guo, Cheng</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We map categorical variables in a function approximation problem into
Euclidean spaces, which are the entity embeddings of the categorical variables.
The mapping is learned by a neural network during the standard supervised
training process. Entity embedding not only reduces memory usage and speeds up
neural networks compared with one-hot encoding, but more importantly by mapping
similar values close to each other in the embedding space it reveals the
intrinsic properties of the categorical variables. We applied it successfully
in a recent Kaggle competition and were able to reach the third position with
relative simple features. We further demonstrate in this paper that entity
embedding helps the neural network to generalize better when the data is sparse
and statistics is unknown. Thus it is especially useful for datasets with lots
of high cardinality features, where other methods tend to overfit. We also
demonstrate that the embeddings obtained from the trained neural network boost
the performance of all tested machine learning methods considerably when used
as the input features instead. As entity embedding defines a distance measure
for categorical variables it can be used for visualizing categorical data and
for data clustering.

 <dc:description>  Personalized recommendations for new users, also known as the cold-start
problem, can be formulated as a contextual bandit problem. Existing contextual
bandit algorithms generally rely on features alone to capture user variability.
Such methods are inefficient in learning new users' interests. In this paper we
propose Latent Contextual Bandits. We consider both the benefit of leveraging a
set of learned latent user classes for new users, and how we can learn such
latent classes from prior users. We show that our approach achieves a better
regret bound than existing algorithms. We also demonstrate the benefit of our
approach using a large real world dataset and a preliminary user study.

 <dc:description>  To improve the performance of reprogramming in wireless sensor network, we
present a novel reprogramming structure and constructive interference-based
dissemination protocol (CIDP) to transmit the patch through out the network
fast and reliability. CIDP disseminates the patch, which is divided into
several packets, to the network exploiting constructive interference. We
evaluate our implementation of CIDP using simulation under different number of
nodes. Our results show that CIDP disseminates the patch less than 4
milliseconds. In general, the probability of a node receives the complete patch
as high as 99.99%.

 <dc:description>  This article introduces ATAB, a tool that automatically generates pairwise
reachability checks for action trees. Action trees can be used to study the
behaviour of real-world concurrent programs. ATAB encodes pairwise reachability
checks into alternating tree automata that determine whether an action tree has
a schedule where any pair of given points in the program are simultaneously
reachable. Because the pairwise reachability problem is undecidable in general
ATAB operates under a restricted form of lock-based concurrency. ATAB produces
alternating tree automata that are more compact and more efficiently checkable
than those that have been previously used. The process is entirely automated,
which simplifies the process of encoding checks for more complex action trees.
The alternating tree automata produced are easier to scale to large numbers of
locks than previous constructions.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of learning a tree graphical model from samples such
that low-order marginals are accurate. We define a distance (&quot;small set TV&quot; or
ssTV) between distributions $P$ and $Q$ by taking the maximum, over all subsets
$\mathcal{S}$ of a given size, of the total variation between the marginals of
P and Q on $\mathcal{S}$. Approximating a distribution to within small ssTV
allows making predictions based on partial observations. Focusing on pairwise
marginals and tree-structured Ising models on $p$ nodes with maximum edge
strength $\beta$, we prove that $\max\{e^{2\beta}\log p,
\eta^{-2}\log(p/\eta)\} $ i.i.d. samples suffices to get a distribution (from
the same class) with ssTV at most $\eta$ from the one generating the samples.

such as MNIST is applied to evaluate efficiency of different training
algorithms in neural networks. This demand is different in Spiking Neural
Networks (SNN) as they require spiking inputs. It is widely believed, in the
biological cortex the timing of spikes is irregular. Poisson distributions
provide adequate descriptions of the irregularity in generating appropriate
spikes. Here, we introduce a spike-based version of MNSIT (handwritten digits
dataset),using Poisson distribution and show the Poissonian property of the
generated streams. We introduce a new version of evt_MNIST which can be used
for neural network evaluation.

 <dc:title>Solving QBF by Abstraction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tentrup, Leander</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many synthesis and verification approaches rely on solving techniques for
quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). Consequently, solution witnesses, i.e.,
Boolean functions, become more important as they represent implementations or
counterexamples. We present a new recursive counterexample guided abstraction
refinement algorithm for solving and certifying QBFs that exploits structural
reasoning on the formula level. The algorithm decomposes the given QBF into one
propositional formula for every scope, a maximal block of consecutive
quantifiers of the same type, that abstracts from assignments of outer and
inner quantifiers. Further, we define a format for proof traces and present an
efficient method to extract certificates from traces that allows building
witnessing functions and certifying the solver result. We report on
experimental evaluation of this algorithm in a prototype solver QuAbS
(Quantified Abstraction Solver) using synthesis benchmark sets and show the
effectiveness of the certification approach.

 <dc:description>  The multiple-recursive matrix method for generating pseudorandom vectors was
introduced by Niederreiter (Linear Algebra Appl. 192 (1993), 301-328). We
propose an algorithm for finding an efficient primitive multiple-recursive
matrix method. Moreover, for improving the linear complexity, we introduce a
tweak on the contents of the primitive multiple-recursive matrix method.

 <dc:description>  We represent a computer cluster as a multi-server queue with some arbitrary
bipartite graph of compatibilities between jobs and servers. Each server
processes its jobs sequentially in FCFS order. The service rate of a job at any
given time is the sum of the service rates of all servers processing this job.
We show that the corresponding queue is quasi-reversible and use this property
to design a scheduling algorithm achieving balanced fair sharing of the service
capacity.

 <dc:description>  Automata with monitor counters, where the transitions do not depend on
counter values, and nested weighted automata are two expressive
automata-theoretic frameworks for quantitative properties. For a well-studied
and wide class of quantitative functions, we establish that automata with
monitor counters and nested weighted automata are equivalent. We study for the
first time such quantitative automata under probabilistic semantics. We show
that several problems that are undecidable for the classical questions of
emptiness and universality become decidable under the probabilistic semantics.
We present a complete picture of decidability for such automata, and even an
almost-complete picture of computational complexity, for the probabilistic
questions we consider.

 <dc:description>  Truck Factor (TF) is a metric proposed by the agile community as a tool to
identify concentration of knowledge in software development environments. It
states the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or
quit) before a project is incapacitated. In other words, TF helps to measure
how prepared is a project to deal with developer turnover. Despite its clear
relevance, few studies explore this metric. Altogether there is no consensus
about how to calculate it, and no supporting evidence backing estimates for
systems in the wild. To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel (and
automated) approach for estimating TF-values, which we execute against a corpus
of 133 popular project in GitHub. We later survey developers as a means to
assess the reliability of our results. Among others, we find that the majority
of our target systems (65%) have TF &lt;= 2. Surveying developers from 67 target
systems provides confidence towards our estimates; in 84% of the valid answers
we collect, developers agree or partially agree that the TF's authors are the
main authors of their systems; in 53% we receive a positive or partially
positive answer regarding our estimated truck factors.

 <dc:description>  Datalog+/- is a family of ontology languages that combine good computational
properties with high expressive power. Datalog+/- languages are provably able
to capture the most relevant Semantic Web languages. In this paper we consider
the class of weakly-sticky (WS) Datalog+/- programs, which allow for certain
useful forms of joins in rule bodies as well as extending the well-known class
of weakly-acyclic TGDs. So far, only non-deterministic algorithms were known
for answering queries on WS Datalog+/- programs. We present novel deterministic
query answering algorithms under WS Datalog+/-. In particular, we propose: (1)
a bottom-up grounding algorithm based on a query-driven chase, and (2) a hybrid
approach based on transforming a WS program into a so-called sticky one, for
which query rewriting techniques are known. We discuss how our algorithms can
be optimized and effectively applied for query answering in real-world
scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Technologies such as aerial photogrammetry allow production of 3D topographic
data including complex environments such as urban areas. Therefore, it is
possible to create High Resolution (HR) Digital Elevation Models (DEM)
incorporating thin above ground elements influencing overland flow paths. Even
though this category of big data has a high level of accuracy, there are still
errors in measurements and hypothesis under DEM elaboration. Moreover,
operators look for optimizing spatial discretization resolution in order to
improve flood models computation time. Errors in measurement, errors in DEM
generation, and operator choices for inclusion of this data within 2D hydraulic
model, might influence results of flood models simulations. These errors and
hypothesis may influence significantly flood modelling results variability. The
purpose of this study is to investigate uncertainties related to (i) the own
error of high resolution topographic data, and (ii) the modeller choices when
including topographic data in hydraulic codes. The aim is to perform a Global
Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) which goes through a Monte-Carlo uncertainty
propagation, to quantify impact of uncertainties, followed by a Sobol' indices
computation, to rank influence of identified parameters on result variability.
A process using a coupling of an environment for parametric computation
(Prom{\'e}th{\'e}e) and a code relying on 2D shallow water equations (FullSWOF
2D) has been developed (P-FS tool). The study has been performed over the lower
part of the Var river valley using the estimated hydrograph of 1994 flood
event. HR topographic data has been made available for the study area, which is
17.5 km 2 , by Nice municipality. Three uncertain parameters were studied: the
measurement error (var. E), the level of details of above-ground element
representation in DEM (buildings, sidewalks, etc.) (var. S), and the spatial
discretization resolution (grid cell size for regular mesh) (var. R). Parameter
var. E follows a probability density function, whereas parameters var. S and
var. R. are discrete operator choices. Combining these parameters, a database
of 2, 000 simulations has been produced using P-FS tool implemented on a high
performance computing structure. In our study case, the output of interest is
the maximal

 <dc:description>  Recently, researchers have made significant progress combining the advances
in deep learning for learning feature representations with reinforcement
learning. Some notable examples include training agents to play Atari games
based on raw pixel data and to acquire advanced manipulation skills using raw
sensory inputs. However, it has been difficult to quantify progress in the
domain of continuous control due to the lack of a commonly adopted benchmark.
In this work, we present a benchmark suite of continuous control tasks,
including classic tasks like cart-pole swing-up, tasks with very high state and
action dimensionality such as 3D humanoid locomotion, tasks with partial
observations, and tasks with hierarchical structure. We report novel findings
based on the systematic evaluation of a range of implemented reinforcement
learning algorithms. Both the benchmark and reference implementations are
released at https://github.com/rllab/rllab in order to facilitate experimental
reproducibility and to encourage adoption by other researchers.

 <dc:description>  A software product line is a family of software products that share a common
set of mandatory features and whose individual products are differentiated by
their variable (optional or alternative) features. Family-based analysis of
software product lines takes as input a single model of a complete product line
and analyzes all its products at the same time. As the number of products in a
software product line may be large, this is generally preferable to analyzing
each product on its own. Family-based analysis, however, requires that standard
algorithms be adapted to accomodate variability.
  In this paper we adapt the standard algorithm for computing limit average
cost of a weighted transition system to software product lines. Limit average
is a useful and popular measure for the long-term average behavior of a quality
attribute such as performance or energy consumption, but has hitherto not been
available for family-based analysis of software product lines. Our algorithm
operates on weighted featured transition systems, at a symbolic level, and
computes limit average cost for all products in a software product line at the
same time. We have implemented the algorithm and evaluated it on several
examples.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Capacity-achieving signaling strategies for the Gaussian wiretap MIMO channel
are investigated without the degradedness assumption. In addition to known
solutions, a number of new rank-deficient solutions for the optimal transmit
covariance matrix are obtained. The case of a weak eavesdropper is considered
in detail and the optimal covariance is established in an explicit, closed form
with no extra assumptions. This provides lower and upper bounds to the secrecy
capacity in the general case with a bounded gap, which are tight for a weak
eavesdropper or/and low SNR. Closed form solutions are also obtained for
isotropic and omnidirectional eavesdroppers, based on which lower and upper
bounds to the secrecy capacity are established in the general case. Sufficient
and necessary conditions for optimality of 3 popular transmission techniques,
namely the zero-forcing (ZF), the standard water-filling (WF) over the channel
eigenmodes and the isotropic signaling (IS), are established for the MIMO
wiretap channel. These solutions are appealing due to their lower complexity.
In particular, no wiretap codes are needed for the ZF transmission, and no
precoding or feedback is needed for the isotropic signaling.

 <dc:description>  Privacy has been a major motivation for distributed problem optimization.
However, even though several methods have been proposed to evaluate it, none of
them is widely used. The Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) is
a fundamental model used to approach various families of distributed problems.
As privacy loss does not occur when a solution is accepted, but when it is
proposed, privacy requirements cannot be interpreted as a criteria of the
objective function of the DCOP. Here we approach the problem by letting both
the optimized costs found in DCOPs and the privacy requirements guide the
agents' exploration of the search space. We introduce Utilitarian Distributed
Constraint Optimization Problem (UDCOP) where the costs and the privacy
requirements are used as parameters to a heuristic modifying the search
process. Common stochastic algorithms for decentralized constraint optimization
problems are evaluated here according to how well they preserve privacy.
Further, we propose some extensions where these solvers modify their search
process to take into account their privacy requirements, succeeding in
significantly reducing their privacy loss without significant degradation of
the solution quality.

solving. However, even though several metrics have been proposed to quantify
it, none of them is easily integrated with common solvers. Constraint
programming is a fundamental paradigm used to approach various families of
problems. We introduce Utilitarian Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems
(UDisCSP) where the utility of each state is estimated as the difference
between the the expected rewards for agreements on assignments for shared
variables, and the expected cost of privacy loss. Therefore, a traditional
DisCSP with privacy requirements is viewed as a planning problem. The actions
available to agents are: communication and local inference. Common
decentralized solvers are evaluated here from the point of view of their
interpretation as greedy planners. Further, we investigate some simple
extensions where these solvers start taking into account the utility function.
In these extensions we assume that the planning problem is further restricting
the set of communication actions to only the communication primitives present
in the corresponding solver protocols. The solvers obtained for the new type of
problems propose the action (communication/inference) to be performed in each
situation, defining thereby the policy.

 <dc:description>  The TREX is a recently introduced method for performing sparse
high-dimensional regression. Despite its statistical promise as an alternative
to the lasso, square-root lasso, and scaled lasso, the TREX is computationally
challenging in that it requires solving a non-convex optimization problem. This
paper shows a remarkable result: despite the non-convexity of the TREX problem,
there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to find the global
minimum. This result adds the TREX to a very short list of non-convex
optimization problems that can be globally optimized (principal components
analysis being a famous example). After deriving and developing this new
approach, we demonstrate that (i) the ability of the preexisting TREX heuristic
to reach the global minimum is strongly dependent on the difficulty of the
underlying statistical problem, (ii) the new polynomial-time algorithm for TREX
permits a novel variable ranking and selection scheme, (iii) this scheme can be
incorporated into a rule that controls the false discovery rate (FDR) of
included features in the model. To achieve this last aim, we provide an
extension of the results of Barber &amp; Candes (2015) to establish that the
knockoff filter framework can be applied to the TREX. This investigation thus
provides both a rare case study of a heuristic for non-convex optimization and
a novel way of exploiting non-convexity for statistical inference.

 <dc:description>  The use of unlicensed spectrum for future LTE systems raises concerns about
its impact on co-located Wi-Fi networks. We report herein on extensions to a
popular network simulator, known as ns-3, to model such coexistence. To our
knowledge, this simulator is novel in two important ways. First, it is
presently the only freely available simulator for coexistence studies, and as
open source software, it offers new opportunities for reproducible research and
collaborative model development. Second, we are not aware of other simulators
with similar wireless models that allow full system studies to be conducted,
such as performance evaluation of upper-layer protocols in a coexistence
environment. We illustrate the value of a system simulator by describing a
simulation campaign for the indoor scenario designed by 3GPP RAN1 using new
ns-3 models for Release 13 LTE Listen Before Talk (LBT) techniques, intended
for fair coexistence with Wi-Fi. LBT models have been widely simulated at the
link and physical layer by many companies in 3GPP RAN1. We first show that we
are able to tune the scenario to reproduce similar performance metrics to those
reported in the literature. We then extend the simulations by adding TCP to the
file transfers and explore the different behaviour observed. Our initial study
reveals that there remain many open questions about how LBT should be
implemented to achieve good coexistence properties, and that a broader scope of
implementation issues, traffic models, and fuller system models should be
studied further before drawing final conclusions on the LBT coexistence
performance.

 <dc:description>  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently evinced immense
success for various image recognition tasks. However, a question of paramount
importance is somewhat unanswered in deep learning research - is the selected
CNN optimal for the dataset in terms of accuracy and model size? In this paper,
we intend to answer this question and introduce a novel strategy that alters
the architecture of a given CNN for a specified dataset, to potentially enhance
the original accuracy while possibly reducing the model size. We use two
operations for architecture refinement, viz. stretching and symmetrical
splitting. Our procedure starts with a pre-trained CNN for a given dataset, and
optimally decides the stretch and split factors across the network to refine
the architecture. We empirically demonstrate the necessity of the two
operations. We evaluate our approach on two natural scenes attributes datasets,
SUN Attributes and CAMIT-NSAD, with architectures of GoogleNet and VGG-11, that
are quite contrasting in their construction. We justify our choice of datasets,
and show that they are interestingly distinct from each other, and together
pose a challenge to our architectural refinement algorithm. Our results
substantiate the usefulness of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  This paper strives to find the sentence best describing the content of an
image or video. Different from existing works, which rely on a joint subspace
for image / video to sentence matching, we propose to do so in a visual space
only. We contribute Word2VisualVec, a deep neural network architecture that
learns to predict a deep visual encoding of textual input based on sentence
vectorization and a multi-layer perceptron. We thoroughly analyze its
architectural design, by varying the sentence vectorization strategy, network
depth and the deep feature to predict for image to sentence matching. We also
generalize Word2VisualVec for matching a video to a sentence, by extending the
predictive abilities to 3-D ConvNet features as well as a visual-audio
representation. Experiments on four challenging image and video benchmarks
detail Word2VisualVec's properties, capabilities for image and video to
sentence matching, and on all datasets its state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:title>How to Diagonalize a MIMO Channel with Arbitrary Transmit Covariance?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Liang</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Rui</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) or multi-antenna communication is a key
technique to achieve high spectral efficiency in wireless systems. For the
point-to-point MIMO channel, it is a well-known result that the channel
singular value decomposition (SVD) based linear precoding and decoding achieves
the channel capacity, which also diagonalizes the MIMO channel into parallel
single-input single-output (SISO) sub-channels for independent encoding and
decoding. However, in multi-user MIMO systems, the optimal transmit covariance
of each MIMO link is generally not its channel SVD based as a result of the
control and balance of the co-channel interference among users. Thus, it
remains unknown whether the linear precoding/decoding strategy is still able to
achieve the capacity of each MIMO link and yet diagonalize its MIMO channel,
with a given set of optimal transmit covariance of all users. This letter
solves this open problem by providing a closed-form capacity-achieving linear
precoder/decoder design that diagonalizes a MIMO channel with arbitrary
transmit covariance. Numerical examples are also provided to validate the
proposed solution in various multi-user MIMO systems.

 <dc:title>Exact Moderate Deviation Asymptotics in Streaming Data Transmission</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lee, Si-Hyeon</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a streaming transmission setup is considered where an encoder
observes a new message in the beginning of each block and a decoder
sequentially decodes each message after a delay of $T$ blocks. In this
streaming setup, the fundamental interplay between the coding rate, the error
probability, and the blocklength in the moderate deviations regime is studied.
For output symmetric channels, the moderate deviations constant is shown to
improve over the block coding or non-streaming setup by exactly a factor of $T$
for a certain range of moderate deviations scalings. For the converse proof, a
more powerful decoder to which some extra information is fedforward is assumed.
The error probability is bounded first for an auxiliary channel and this result
is translated back to the original channel by using a newly developed
change-of-measure lemma, where the speed of decay of the remainder term in the
exponent is carefully characterized. For the achievability proof, a known
coding technique that involves a joint encoding and decoding of fresh and past
messages is applied with some manipulations in the error analysis.

 <dc:description>  Learning novel tasks is a complex cognitive activity requiring the learner to
acquire diverse declarative and procedural knowledge. Prior ACT-R models of
acquiring task knowledge from instruction focused on learning procedural
knowledge from declarative instructions encoded in semantic memory. In this
paper, we identify the requirements for designing compu- tational models that
learn task knowledge from situated task- oriented interactions with an expert
and then describe and evaluate a model of learning from situated interactive
instruc- tion that is implemented in the Soar cognitive architecture.

 <dc:description>  Object categorization is a hot issue of an image mining. Contextual
information between objects is one of the important semantic knowledge of an
image. However, the previous researches for an object categorization have not
made full use of the contextual information, especially the spatial relations
between objects. In addition, the object categorization methods, which
generally use the probabilistic graphical models to implement the incorporation
of contextual information with appearance of objects, are almost inevitable to
evaluate the intractable partition function for normalization. In this work, we
introduced fully-connected fuzzy spatial relations including directional,
distance and topological relations between object regions, so the spatial
relational information could be fully utilized. Then, the spatial relations
were considered as well as co-occurrence and appearance of objects by using
energy-based model, where the energy function was defined as the region-object
association potential and the configuration potential of objects. Minimizing
the energy function of whole image arrangement, we obtained the optimal label
set about the image regions and addressed the evaluation of intractable
partition function in conditional random fields. Experimental results show the
validity and reliability of this proposed method.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Content-based Routing using Subscription Subgrouping in
  Structured Overlays</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shafique, Muhammad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cyclic or general overlays may provide multiple paths between publishers and
subscribers. However, an advertisement tree and a matching subscription
activates only one path for notifications routing in publish/subscribe systems.
This poses serious challenges in handling network conditions like congestion,
and link or broker failures. Further, content-based dynamic routing of
notifications requires instantaneous updates in routing paths, which is not a
scalable option. This paper introduces a clustering approach with a bit-vector
technique for inter-cluster dynamic routing of notifications in a structured
cyclic topology that provides multiple paths between publishers and interested
subscribers. The advertisement forwarding process exploits the structured
nature of the overlay topology to generate advertisement trees of length 1
without generating duplicate messages in the advertisement forwarding process.
Issued subscriptions are divided into multiple disjoint subgropus, where each
subscription is broadcast to a cluster, which is a limited part of the
structured cyclic overlay network. We implemented novel static and
intra-cluster dynamic routing algorithms in the proposed overlay topology for
our advertisement-based publish/subscribe system, called OctopiA. We also
performed a pragmatic comparison of our two algorithms with the
state-of-the-art. Experiments on a cluster testbed show that our approach
generates fewer inter-broker messages, and is scalable.

 <dc:description>  The prevalent scene text detection approach follows four sequential steps
comprising character candidate detection, false character candidate removal,
text line extraction, and text line verification. However, errors occur and
accumulate throughout each of these sequential steps which often lead to low
detection performance. To address these issues, we propose a unified scene text
detection system, namely Text Flow, by utilizing the minimum cost (min-cost)
flow network model. With character candidates detected by cascade boosting, the
min-cost flow network model integrates the last three sequential steps into a
single process which solves the error accumulation problem at both character
level and text line level effectively. The proposed technique has been tested
on three public datasets, i.e, ICDAR2011 dataset, ICDAR2013 dataset and a
multilingual dataset and it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all
three datasets with much higher recall and F-score. The good performance on the
multilingual dataset shows that the proposed technique can be used for the
detection of texts in different languages.

 <dc:description>  In this note, we investigate the performance of optimal double circulant even
codes which are not self-dual, as measured by the decoding error probability in
bounded distance decoding. To do this, we classify the optimal double circulant
even codes that are not self-dual which have the smallest weight distribution
for lengths up to $72$. We also give some restrictions on the weight
enumerators of (extremal) self-dual $[54,27,10]$ codes with shadows of minimum
weight $3$. Finally, we consider the performance of extremal self-dual codes of
lengths $88$ and $112$.

 <dc:description>  We consider an asynchronous voting process on graphs which we call discordant
voting, and which can be described as follows. Initially each vertex holds one
of two opinions, red or blue say. Neighbouring vertices with different opinions
interact pairwise. After an interaction both vertices have the same colour. The
quantity of interest is T, the time to reach consensus , i.e. the number of
interactions needed for all vertices have the same colour.
  An edge whose endpoint colours differ (i.e. one vertex is coloured red and
the other one blue) is said to be discordant. A vertex is discordant if its is
incident with a discordant edge. In discordant voting, all interactions are
based on discordant edges. Because the voting process is asynchronous there are
several ways to update the colours of the interacting vertices. Push: Pick a
random discordant vertex and push its colour to a random discordant neighbour.
Pull: Pick a random discordant vertex and pull the colour of a random
discordant neighbour. Oblivious: Pick a random endpoint of a random discordant
edge and push the colour to the other end point.
  We show that E(T), the expected time to reach consensus, depends strongly on
the underlying graph and the update rule. For connected graphs on n vertices,
and an initial half red, half blue colouring the following hold. For oblivious
voting, E(T) =n^2/4 independent of the underlying graph. For the complete graph
K_n, the push protocol has E(T)= Theta(n log(n)), whereas the pull protocol has
E(T)= Theta(2^n). For the cycle C_n all three protocols have E(T) = Theta(n^2).
For the star graph however, the pull protocol has E(T)=O(n^2), whereas the push
protocol is slower with E(T) = Theta(n^2 log(n)).
  The wide variation in E(T) for the pull protocol is to be contrasted with the
well known model of synchronous pull voting, for which E(T) = O(n) on many
classes of expanders.

 <dc:title>Why and How to Pay Different Attention to Phrase Alignments of Different
  Intensities</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yin, Wenpeng</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sch&#xfc;tze, Hinrich</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work studies comparatively two typical sentence pair classification
tasks: textual entailment (TE) and answer selection (AS), observing that phrase
alignments of different intensities contribute differently in these tasks. We
address the problems of identifying phrase alignments of flexible granularity
and pooling alignments of different intensities for these tasks. Examples for
flexible granularity are alignments between two single words, between a single
word and a phrase and between a short phrase and a long phrase. By intensity we
roughly mean the degree of match, it ranges from identity over surface-form
co-occurrence, rephrasing and other semantic relatedness to unrelated words as
in lots of parenthesis text. Prior work (i) has limitations in phrase
generation and representation, or (ii) conducts alignment at word and phrase
levels by handcrafted features or (iii) utilizes a single attention mechanism
over alignment intensities without considering the characteristics of specific
tasks, which limits the system's effectiveness across tasks. We propose an
architecture based on Gated Recurrent Unit that supports (i) representation
learning of phrases of arbitrary granularity and (ii) task-specific focusing of
phrase alignments between two sentences by attention pooling. Experimental
results on TE and AS match our observation and are state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  This article presents evidence of performance deterioration in online user
sessions quantified by studying a massive dataset containing over 55 million
comments posted on Reddit in April 2015. After segmenting the sessions (i.e.,
periods of activity without a prolonged break) depending on their intensity
(i.e., how many posts users produced during sessions), we observe a general
decrease in the quality of comments produced by users over the course of
sessions. We propose mixed-effects models that capture the impact of session
intensity on comments, including their length, quality, and the responses they
generate from the community. Our findings suggest performance deterioration:
Sessions of increasing intensity are associated with the production of shorter,
progressively less complex comments, which receive declining quality scores (as
rated by other users), and are less and less engaging (i.e., they attract fewer
responses). Our contribution evokes a connection between cognitive and
attention dynamics and the usage of online social peer production platforms,
specifically the effects of deterioration of user performance.

 <dc:description>  We compare the end-to-end training approach to a modular approach in which a
system is decomposed into semantically meaningful components. We focus on the
sample complexity aspect, in the regime where an extremely high accuracy is
necessary, as is the case in autonomous driving applications. We demonstrate
cases in which the number of training examples required by the end-to-end
approach is exponentially larger than the number of examples required by the
semantic abstraction approach.

 <dc:description>  In the graph balancing problem the goal is to orient a weighted undirected
graph to minimize the maximum weighted in-degree. This special case of makespan
minimization is NP-hard to approximate to a factor better than 3/2 even when
there are only two types of edge weights. In this note we describe a simple 3/2
approximation for the graph balancing problem with two-edge types, settling
this very special case of makespan minimization.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are simple dynamical systems whose
computational power has been attributed to their short-term memory. Short-term
memory of RNNs has been previously studied analytically only for the case of
orthogonal networks, and only under annealed approximation, and uncorrelated
input. Here for the first time, we present an exact solution to the memory
capacity and the task-solving performance as a function of the structure of a
given network instance, enabling direct determination of the
function--structure relation in RNNs. We calculate the memory capacity for
arbitrary networks with exponentially correlated input and further related it
to the performance of the system on signal processing tasks in a supervised
learning setup. We compute the expected error and the worst-case error bound as
a function of the spectra of the network and the correlation structure of its
inputs and outputs. Our results give an explanation for learning and
generalization of task solving using short-term memory, which is crucial for
building alternative computer architectures using physical phenomena based on
the short-term memory principle.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the properties of syntactic monoids of bifix-free regular languages.
In particular, we solve an open problem concerning syntactic complexity: We
prove that the cardinality of the syntactic semigroup of a bifix-free language
with state complexity $n$ is at most $(n-1)^{n-3}+(n-2)^{n-3}+(n-3)2^{n-3}$ for
$n\ge 6$. The main proof uses a large construction with the method of injective
function. Since this bound is known to be reachable, and the values for $n \le
5$ are known, this completely settles the problem. We also prove that
$(n-2)^{n-3} + (n-3)2^{n-3} - 1$ is the minimal size of the alphabet required
to meet the bound for $n \ge 6$. Finally, we show that the largest transition
semigroups of minimal DFAs which recognize bifix-free languages are unique up
to renaming the states.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a novel information theoretic framework for
dictionary learning (DL) and sparse coding (SC) on a statistical manifold (the
manifold of probability distributions). Unlike the traditional DL and SC
framework, our new formulation {\it does not explicitly incorporate any
sparsity inducing norm in the cost function but yet yields SCs}. Moreover, we
extend this framework to the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices,
$\mathcal{P}_n$. Our algorithm approximates the data points, which are
probability distributions, by the weighted Kullback-Leibeler center (KL-center)
of the dictionary atoms. The KL-center is the minimizer of the maximum
KL-divergence between the unknown center and members of the set whose center is
being sought. Further, {\it we proved that this KL-center is a sparse
combination of the dictionary atoms}. Since, the data reside on a statistical
manifold, the data fidelity term can not be as simple as in the case of the
vector-space data. We therefore employ the geodesic distance between the data
and a sparse approximation of the data element. This cost function is minimized
using an acceleterated gradient descent algorithm. An extensive set of
experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We
present several experiments involving a variety of classification problems in
Computer Vision applications. Further, we demonstrate the performance of our
algorithm by comparing it to several state-of-the-art methods both in terms of
classification accuracy and sparsity.

the Poe story is fitted to the data. A segmentation of the storyline is used in
order to map out the diachrony. Based on this, it will be shown how synchronous
aspects, potentially related to Lacanian registers, can be sought. This
demonstrates the effectiveness of an approach based on a model template of the
storyline narrative. In a second and more comprehensive investigation, we
develop an approach for revealing, that is, uncovering, Lacanian register
relationships. Objectives of this work include the wide and general application
of our methodology. This methodology is strongly based on the &quot;letting the data

is also the geometric data analysis, both qualitative and quantitative
analytics, developed by Pierre Bourdieu.

 <dc:title>Online Combinatorial Optimization for Interconnected Refrigeration
  Systems: Linear Approximation and Submodularity</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yang, Insoon</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Commercial refrigeration systems consume 7% of the total commercial energy
consumption in the United States. Improving their energy efficiency contributes
to the sustainability of global energy systems and the supermarket business
sector. This paper proposes a new control method that can save the energy
consumption of multi-case supermarket refrigerators by explicitly taking into
account their interconnected and switched system dynamics. Its novelty is a
bilevel combinatorial optimization formulation to generate ON/OFF control
actions for expansion valves and compressors. The inner optimization module
keeps display case temperatures in a desirable range and the outer optimization
module minimizes energy consumption. In addition to its energy-saving
capability, the proposed controller significantly reduces the frequency of
compressor switchings by employing a conservative compressor control strategy.
However, solving this bilevel optimization problem associated with
interconnected and switched systems is a computationally challenging task. To
solve the problem in near real time, we propose two approximation algorithms
that can solve both the inner and outer optimization problems at once. The
first algorithm uses a linear approximation, and the second is based on the
submodular structure of the optimization problem. Both are (polynomial-time)
scalable algorithms and generate near-optimal solutions with performance
guarantees. Our work complements existing optimization-based control methods
(e.g., MPC) for supermarket refrigerators, as our algorithms can be adopted as
a tool for solving combinatorial optimization problems arising in these
methods.

 <dc:description>  Automatic service discovery is essential to realizing the full potential of
the Internet of Things (IoT). While discovery protocols like Multicast DNS,
Apple AirDrop, and Bluetooth Low Energy have gained widespread adoption across
both IoT and mobile devices, most of these protocols do not offer any form of
privacy control for the service, and often leak sensitive information such as
service type, device hostname, device owner's identity, and more in the clear.
  To address the need for better privacy in both the IoT and the mobile
landscape, we develop two protocols for private service discovery and private
mutual authentication. Our protocols provide private and authentic service
advertisements, zero round-trip (0-RTT) mutual authentication, and are provably
secure in the Canetti-Krawczyk key-exchange model. In contrast to alternatives,
our protocols are lightweight and require minimal modification to existing
key-exchange protocols. We integrate our protocols into an existing open-source
distributed applications framework, and provide benchmarks on multiple hardware
platforms: Intel Edisons, Raspberry Pis, smartphones, laptops, and desktops.
Finally, we discuss some privacy limitations of the Apple AirDrop protocol (a
peer-to-peer file sharing mechanism) and show how to improve the privacy of
Apple AirDrop using our private mutual authentication protocol.

 <dc:title>Sparse p-Adic Data Coding for Computationally Efficient and Effective

 <dc:description>  We develop the theory and practical implementation of p-adic sparse coding of
data. Rather than the standard, sparsifying criterion that uses the $L_0$
pseudo-norm, we use the p-adic norm. We require that the hierarchy or tree be
node-ranked, as is standard practice in agglomerative and other hierarchical
clustering, but not necessarily with decision trees. In order to structure the
data, all computational processing operations are direct reading of the data,
or are bounded by a constant number of direct readings of the data, implying
linear computational time. Through p-adic sparse data coding, efficient storage
results, and for bounded p-adic norm stored data, search and retrieval are
constant time operations. Examples show the effectiveness of this new approach
to content-driven encoding and displaying of data.

 <dc:title>Limits to Verification and Validation of Agentic Behavior</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Verification and validation of agentic behavior have been suggested as
important research priorities in efforts to reduce risks associated with the
creation of general artificial intelligence (Russell et al 2015). In this paper
we question the appropriateness of using language of certainty with respect to
efforts to manage that risk. We begin by establishing a very general formalism
to characterize agentic behavior and to describe standards of acceptable
behavior. We show that determination of whether an agent meets any particular
standard is not computable. We discuss the extent of the burden associated with
verification by manual proof and by automated behavioral governance. We show
that to ensure decidability of the behavioral standard itself, one must further
limit the capabilities of the agent. We then demonstrate that if our concerns
relate to outcomes in the physical world, attempts at validation are futile.
Finally, we show that layered architectures aimed at making these challenges
tractable mistakenly equate intentions with actions or outcomes, thereby
failing to provide any guarantees. We conclude with a discussion of why
language of certainty should be eradicated from the conversation about the
safety of general artificial intelligence.

 <dc:title>BinderCracker: Assessing the Robustness of Android System Services</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Feng, Huan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shin, Kang G.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In Android, communications between apps and system services are supported by
a transaction-based Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism. Binder, as the
cornerstone of this IPC mechanism, separates two communicating parties as
client and server. As with any client-server model, the server should not make
any assumption on the validity (sanity) of client-side transaction. To our
surprise, we find this principle has frequently been overlooked in the
implementation of Android system services. In this paper, we demonstrate the
prevalence and severity of this vulnerability surface and try to answer why
developers keep making this seemingly simple mistake. Specifically, we design
and implement BinderCracker, an automatic testing framework that supports
parameter-aware fuzzing and has identified more than 100 vulnerabilities in six
major versions of Android, including the latest version Android 6.0,
Marshmallow. Some of the vulnerabilities have severe security implications,
causing privileged code execution or permanent Denial-of-Service (DoS). We
analyzed the root causes of these vulnerabilities to find that most of them
exist because system service developers only considered exploitations via
public APIs. We thus highlight the deficiency of testing only on client-side
public APIs and argue for the necessity of testing and protection on the Binder
interface - the actual security boundary. Specifically, we discuss the
effectiveness and practicality of potential countermeasures, such as
precautionary testing and runtime diagnostic.

 <dc:description>  Clifford algebras have broad applications in science and engineering. The use
of Clifford algebras can be further promoted in these fields by availability of
computational tools that automate tedious routine calculations. We offer an
extensive demonstration of the applications of Clifford algebras in
electromagnetism using the geometric algebra G3 = Cl(3,0) as a computational
model in the Maxima computer algebra system. We compare the geometric
algebra-based approach with conventional symbolic tensor calculations supported
by Maxima, based on the itensor package. The Clifford algebra functionality of
Maxima is distributed as two new packages called clifford - for basic
simplification of Clifford products, outer products, scalar products and
inverses; and cliffordan - for applications of geometric calculus.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of estimating the mean and covariance of a
distribution from iid samples in $\mathbb{R}^n$, in the presence of an $\eta$
fraction of malicious noise; this is in contrast to much recent work where the
noise itself is assumed to be from a distribution of known type. The agnostic
problem includes many interesting special cases, e.g., learning the parameters
of a single Gaussian (or finding the best-fit Gaussian) when $\eta$ fraction of
data is adversarially corrupted, agnostically learning a mixture of Gaussians,
agnostic ICA, etc. We present polynomial-time algorithms to estimate the mean
and covariance with error guarantees in terms of information-theoretic lower
bounds. As a corollary, we also obtain an agnostic algorithm for Singular Value
Decomposition.

 <dc:description>  We present a probabilistic generative model for inferring a description of
coordinated, recursively structured group activities at multiple levels of
temporal granularity based on observations of individuals' trajectories. The
model accommodates: (1) hierarchically structured groups, (2) activities that
are temporally and compositionally recursive, (3) component roles assigning
different subactivity dynamics to subgroups of participants, and (4) a
nonparametric Gaussian Process model of trajectories. We present an MCMC
sampling framework for performing joint inference over recursive activity
descriptions and assignment of trajectories to groups, integrating out
continuous parameters. We demonstrate the model's expressive power in several
simulated and complex real-world scenarios from the VIRAT and UCLA Aerial Event
video data sets.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  The Shannon Noiseless coding theorem (the data-compression principle) asserts
that for an information source with an alphabet $\mathcal X=\{0,\ldots ,\ell
-1\}$ and an asymptotic equipartition property, one can reduce the number of
stored strings $(x_0,\ldots ,x_{n-1})\in {\mathcal X}^n$ to $\ell^{nh}$ with an
arbitrary small error-probability. Here $h$ is the entropy rate of the source
(calculated to the base $\ell$). We consider further reduction based on the
concept of utility of a string measured in terms of a rate of a weight
function. The novelty of the work is that the distribution of memory is
analyzed from a probabilistic point of view. A convenient tool for assessing
the degree of reduction is a probabilistic large deviation principle. Assuming
a Markov-type setting, we discuss some relevant formulas, including the case of
a general alphabet.

 <dc:description>  Cardiac motion analysis from B-mode ultrasound sequence is a key task in
assessing the health of the heart. The paper proposes a new methodology for
cardiac motion analysis based on the temporal behaviour of points of interest
on the myocardium. We define a new signal called the Temporal Flow Graph (TFG)
which depicts the movement of a point of interest over time. It is a graphical
representation derived from a flow field and describes the temporal evolution
of a point. We prove that TFG for an object undergoing periodic motion is also
periodic. This principle can be utilized to derive both global and local
information from a given sequence. We demonstrate this for detecting motion
irregularities at the sequence, as well as regional levels on real and
synthetic data. A coarse localisation of anatomical landmarks such as centres
of left/right cavities and valve points is also demonstrated using TFGs.

 <dc:description>  The paper studies recoverability of missing values for sequences in a
pathwise setting without probabilistic assumptions. This setting is oriented on
a situation where the underlying sequence is considered as a sole sequence
rather than a member of an ensemble with known statistical properties.
Sufficient conditions of recoverability are obtained; it is shown that
sequences are recoverable if there is a certain degree of degeneracy of the
Z-transforms. We found that, in some cases, this degree can be measured as the
number of the derivatives of Z-transform vanishing at a point. For processes
with non-degenerate Z-transform, an optimal recovering based on the projection
on a set of recoverable sequences is suggested. Some robustness of the solution
with respect to noise contamination and truncation is established.

 <dc:title>An Arithmetic Coding Scheme for Blocked-based Compressive Sensing of
  Images</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gao, Min</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) is recently coupled with uniform
scalar quantization (SQ) to improve the rate-distortion (RD) performance for
the block-based quantized compressive sensing (CS) of images. In this
framework, for each block's CS measurements, a prediction is generated based on
the reconstructed CS measurements of the previous blocks and subtracted from
measurements of the current block in the measurement domain. The resulting
residual is then quantized by uniform SQ to generate the quantization index.
However, the entropy coding is still required to remove the statistical
redundancies between the quantization indices and generate the bitstream. Thus,
in this paper, we proposed an arithmetic coding scheme for the quantization
index within DPCM-plus-SQ framework by analyzing their statistics. Experimental
results demonstrate that further RD performance can be achieved compared to
original DPCM-plus-SQ scheme and transform coefficient coding in CABAC.

 <dc:description>  Nearest Neighbor(s) search is the fundamental computational primitive to
tackle massive dataset. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) has been a bracing
tool for Nearest Neighbor(s) search in high dimensional spaces. However,
traditional LSH systems cannot be applied in online big data systems to handle
a large volume of query/update requests, because most of the systems optimize
the query efficiency with the assumption of infrequent updates and missing the
parallel-friendly design. As a result, the state-of-the-art LSH systems cannot
adapt the system response to the user behavior interactively.
  In this paper, we propose a new LSH system called PFO. It handles
query/update requests in RAM and scales the system capacity by using flash
memory. To achieve high streaming data throughput, PFO adopts a
parallel-friendly indexing structure while preserving the distance between data
points. Further, it accommodates inbound data in real-time and dispatches
update requests intelligently to eliminate the cross-threads synchronization.
We carried out extensive evaluations with large synthetic and standard
benchmark datasets. Results demonstrate that PFO delivers shorter latency and
offers scalable capacity compared with the existing LSH systems. PFO serves
with higher throughput than the state-of-the-art LSH indexing structure when
dealing with online query/update requests to nearest neighbors. Meanwhile, PFO
returns neighbors with much better quality, thus being efficient to handle
online big data applications, e.g. streaming recommendation system, interactive
machine learning systems.

 <dc:title>Deep Learning with Eigenvalue Decay Regularizer</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ludwig, Oswaldo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper extends our previous work on regularization of neural networks
using Eigenvalue Decay by employing a soft approximation of the dominant
eigenvalue in order to enable the calculation of its derivatives in relation to
the synaptic weights, and therefore the application of back-propagation, which
is a primary demand for deep learning. Moreover, we extend our previous
theoretical analysis to deep neural networks and multiclass classification
problems. Our method is implemented as an additional regularizer in Keras, a
modular neural networks library written in Python, and evaluated in the
benchmark data sets Reuters Newswire Topics Classification, IMDB database for
binary sentiment classification, MNIST database of handwritten digits and
CIFAR-10 data set for image classification.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, new exact and approximate moment generating functions (MGF)
expression for generalized fading models are derived. Specifically, we consider
the ${\eta}-{\lambda}-{\mu}$, ${\alpha}-{\mu}$, ${\alpha}-{\eta}-{\mu}$,
${\alpha}-{\lambda}-{\mu}$, ${\alpha}-{\kappa}-{\mu}$, and
${\alpha}-{\lambda}-{\eta}-{\mu}$ generalized fading distributions to derive
approximate MGF expressions. The new expressions are very accurate and, in
contrast to earlier results in the literature, avoid any complicated special
functions, e.g. the Meijer-$G$ and Fox $H$-functions. As such, the new MGF
expressions allow easier and more efficient analytical manipulations, which
also apply for their special cases such as the Rayleigh, Rice, and Nakagami-m
fading. As an illustrative application, the average bit error rates for each of
the fading models are evaluated using the new derived MGF expressions. The
accuracy of the analytical results by using the numerically computed results as
a basis of comparison as well as published results from the literature.

 <dc:description>  The concept of parity check matrices of linear binary codes has been extended
by Heden [9] to parity check systems of nonlinear binary codes. In the present
paper we extend this concept to parity check systems of nonlinear codes over
finite commutative Frobenius rings. Using parity check systems, results on how
to get some fundamental properties of the codes are given. Moreover, parity
check systems and its connection to characters is investigated and a
MacWilliams type theorem on the distance distribution is given.

 <dc:title>Better Analysis of GREEDY Binary Search Tree on Decomposable Sequences</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Goyal, Navin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Gupta, Manoj</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In their seminal paper [Sleator and Tarjan, J.ACM, 1985], the authors
conjectured that the splay tree is dynamically optimal binary search tree
(BST). In spite of decades of intensive research, the problem remains open.
Perhaps a more basic question, which has also attracted much attention, is if
there exists any dynamically optimal BST algorithm. One such candidate is
GREEDY which is a simple and intuitive BST algorithm [Lucas, Rutgers Tech.
Report, 1988; Munro, ESA, 2000; Demaine, Harmon, Iacono, Kane and Patrascu,
SODA, 2009]. [Demaine et al., SODA, 2009] showed a novel connection between a
geometric problem.
  Since dynamic optimality conjecture in its most general form remains elusive
despite much effort, researchers have studied this problem on special
sequences. Recently, [Chalermsook, Goswami, Kozma, Mehlhorn and Saranurak,
FOCS, 2015] studied a type of sequences known as $k$-{\em decomposable
sequences} in this context, where $k$ parametrizes easiness of the sequence.
Using tools from forbidden submatrix theory, they showed that GREEDY takes
$n2^{O(k^2)}$ time on this sequence and explicitly raised the question of
improving this bound.
  In this paper, we show that GREEDY takes $O(n \log{k})$ time on
$k$-decomposable sequences. In contrast to the previous approach, ours is based
on first principles. One of the main ingredients of our result is a new
construction of a lower bound certificate on the performance of any algorithm.
This certificate is constructed using the execution of GREEDY, and is more
nuanced and possibly more flexible than the previous independent set
certificate of Demaine et al. This result, which is applicable to all
sequences, may be of independent interest and may lead to further progress in
analyzing GREEDY on $k$-decomposable as well as general sequences.

 <dc:description>  In this study, a single autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) aims to
rendezvous with a submerged leader recovery vehicle through a cluttered and
variable operating field. The rendezvous problem is transformed into a
nonlinear optimal control problem (NOCP) and then numerical solutions are
provided. A penalty function method is utilized to combine the boundary
conditions, vehicular and environmental constraints with the performance index
that is final rendezvous time.Four evolutionary based path planning methods
namely particle swarm optimization (PSO), biogeography-based optimization
(BBO), differential evolution (DE) and Firefly algorithm (FA) are employed to
establish a reactive planner module and provide a numerical solution for the
proposed NOCP. The objective is to synthesize and analysis the performance and
capability of the mentioned methods for guiding an AUV from loitering point
toward the rendezvous place through a comprehensive simulation study.The
proposed planner module entails a heuristic for refining the path considering
situational awareness of underlying environment, encompassing static and
dynamic obstacles overwhelmed in spatiotemporal current vectors.This leads to
accommodate the unforeseen changes in the operating field like emergence of
unpredicted obstacles or variability of current vector filed and turbulent
regions. The simulation results demonstrate the inherent robustness and
significant efficiency of the proposed planner in enhancement of the vehicle's
autonomy in terms of using current force, coping undesired current disturbance
for the desired rendezvous purpose. Advantages and shortcoming of all utilized
methods are also presented based on the obtained results.

 <dc:description>  A matching $M$ in a graph $G$ is said to be uniquely restricted if there is
no other matching in $G$ that matches the same set of vertices as $M$. We
describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute a maximum cardinality uniquely
restricted matching in an interval graph, thereby answering a question of
Golumbic et al. (&quot;Uniquely restricted matchings&quot;, M. C. Golumbic, T. Hirst and
M. Lewenstein, Algorithmica, 31:139--154, 2001). Our algorithm actually solves
the more general problem of computing a maximum cardinality &quot;strong independent
set&quot; in an interval nest digraph, which may be of independent interest.
Further, we give linear-time algorithms for computing maximum cardinality
uniquely restricted matchings in proper interval graphs and bipartite
permutation graphs.

 <dc:title>On Multiple-Input Multiple-Output OFDM with Index Modulation for Next
  Generation Wireless Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Basar, Ertugrul</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
with index modulation (MIMO-OFDM-IM) is a novel multicarrier transmission
technique which has been proposed recently as an alternative to classical
MIMO-OFDM. In this scheme, OFDM with index modulation (OFDM-IM) concept is
combined with MIMO transmission to take advantage of the benefits of these two
techniques. In this paper, we shed light on the implementation and error
performance analysis of the MIMO-OFDM-IM scheme for next generation 5G wireless
networks. Maximum likelihood (ML), near-ML, simple minimum mean square error
(MMSE) and ordered successive interference cancellation (OSIC) based MMSE
detectors of MIMO-OFDM-IM are proposed and their theoretical performance is
investigated. It has been shown via extensive computer simulations that
MIMO-OFDM-IM scheme provides an interesting trade-off between error performance
and spectral efficiency as well as it achieves considerably better error
performance than classical MIMO-OFDM using different type detectors and under
realistic conditions.

 <dc:description>  Accattoli and Dal Lago have recently proved that the number of steps in a
leftmost-outermost $\beta$-reduction rewrite sequence to normal form provides
an invariant cost model for the Lambda Calculus. They sketch how to implement
leftmost-outermost $\beta$-reduction rewrite sequences on a reasonable machine,
with a polynomial overhead, by using simulating rewrite sequences in the linear
explicit substitution calculus.
  I am interested in an implementation that demonstrates this result, but uses
graph reduction techniques similar to those that are employed by runtime
evaluators of functional programs. As a crucial stepping stone I prove here the
following property of leftmost-outermost $\beta$-reduction rewrite sequences in
the Lambda Calculus: For every lambda-term $t$ with depth $d$ it holds that in
every step of a leftmost-outermost $\beta$-reduction rewrite sequence starting
on $t$ the term depth increases by at most $d$, and hence that the depth of the
$n$-th reduct of $t$ in such a rewrite sequence is bounded by $d\cdot (n+1)$.

 <dc:title>A Local Algorithm for Constructing Spanners in Minor-Free Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Levi, Reut</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Constructing a spanning tree of a graph is one of the most basic tasks in
graph theory. We consider this problem in the setting of local algorithms: one
wants to quickly determine whether a given edge $e$ is in a specific spanning
tree, without computing the whole spanning tree, but rather by inspecting the
local neighborhood of $e$. The challenge is to maintain consistency. That is,
to answer queries about different edges according to the same spanning tree.
Since it is known that this problem cannot be solved without essentially
viewing all the graph, we consider the relaxed version of finding a spanning
subgraph with $(1+\epsilon)n$ edges (where $n$ is the number of vertices and
$\epsilon$ is a given sparsity parameter). It is known that this relaxed
problem requires inspecting $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ edges in general graphs, which
motivates the study of natural restricted families of graphs. One such family
is the family of graphs with an excluded minor. For this family there is an
algorithm that achieves constant success probability, and inspects
$(d/\epsilon)^{poly(h)\log(1/\epsilon)}$ edges (for each edge it is queried
on), where $d$ is the maximum degree in the graph and $h$ is the size of the
excluded minor. The distances between pairs of vertices in the spanning
subgraph $G'$ are at most a factor of $poly(d, 1/\epsilon, h)$ larger than in
$G$.
  In this work, we show that for an input graph that is $H$-minor free for any
$H$ of size $h$, this task can be performed by inspecting only $poly(d,
1/\epsilon, h)$ edges. The distances between pairs of vertices in the spanning
subgraph $G'$ are at most a factor of $\tilde{O}(h\log(d)/\epsilon)$ larger
than in $G$. Furthermore, the error probability of the new algorithm is
significantly improved to $\Theta(1/n)$. This algorithm can also be easily
adapted to yield an efficient algorithm for the distributed setting.

 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved breakthrough
performance in many pattern recognition tasks such as image classification.
However, the development of high-quality deep models typically relies on a
substantial amount of trial-and-error, as there is still no clear understanding
of when and why a deep model works. In this paper, we present a visual
analytics approach for better understanding, diagnosing, and refining deep
CNNs. We formulate a deep CNN as a directed acyclic graph. Based on this
formulation, a hybrid visualization is developed to disclose the multiple
facets of each neuron and the interactions between them. In particular, we
introduce a hierarchical rectangle packing algorithm and a matrix reordering
algorithm to show the derived features of a neuron cluster. We also propose a
biclustering-based edge bundling method to reduce visual clutter caused by a
large number of connections between neurons. We evaluated our method on a set
of CNNs and the results are generally favorable.

users' burden on the information overload. In such a scenario, extensive amount
of heterogeneous information such as tags, image content, in addition to the
user-to-item preferences, is extremely valuable for making effective
recommendations. In this paper, we explore a novel hybrid algorithm termed {\em
STM}, for image recommendation. STM jointly considers the problem of image
content analysis with the users' preferences on the basis of sparse
representation. STM is able to tackle the challenges of highly sparse user
feedbacks and cold-start problmes in the social network scenario. In addition,
our model is based on the classical probabilistic matrix factorization and can
be easily extended to incorporate other useful information such as the social
relationships. We evaluate our approach with a newly collected 0.3 million
social image data set from Flickr. The experimental results demonstrate that
sparse topic modeling of the image content leads to more effective
recommendations, , with a significant performance gain over the
state-of-the-art alternatives.

 <dc:title>Rotation-Invariant Restricted Boltzmann Machine Using Shared Gradient

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Finding suitable features has been an essential problem in computer vision.
We focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), which, despite their
versatility, cannot accommodate transformations that may occur in the scene. As
a result, several approaches have been proposed that consider a set of
transformations, which are used to either augment the training set or transform
the actual learned filters. In this paper, we propose the Explicit
Rotation-Invariant Restricted Boltzmann Machine, which exploits prior
information coming from the dominant orientation of images. Our model extends
the standard RBM, by adding a suitable number of weight matrices, associated
with each dominant gradient. We show that our approach is able to learn
rotation-invariant features, comparing it with the classic formulation of RBM
on the MNIST benchmark dataset. Overall, requiring less hidden units, our
method learns compact features, which are robust to rotations.

 <dc:description>  Vector perturbation is an encoding method for broadcast channels in which the
transmitter solves a shortest vector problem in a lattice to create a
perturbation vector, which is then added to the data before transmission. In
this work, we introduce nested lattice codes into vector perturbation systems,
resulting in a strategy which we deem matrix perturbation. We propose design
criteria for the nested lattice codes, and show empirically that lattices
satisfying these design criteria can improve the performance of vector
perturbation systems. The resulting design criteria are the same as those
recently proposed for the Compute-and-Forward protocol.

 <dc:description>  In a standard $f$-connectivity network design problem, we are given an
undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, a cut-requirement function $f:2^V \rightarrow
{\mathbb{N}}$, and non-negative costs $c(e)$ for all $e \in E$. We are then
asked to find a minimum-cost vector $x \in {\mathbb{N}}^E$ such that
$x(\delta(S)) \geq f(S)$ for all $S \subseteq V$. We focus on the class of such
problems where $f$ is a proper function. This encodes many well-studied NP-hard
problems such as the generalized survivable network design problem.
  In this paper we present the first strongly polynomial time FPTAS for solving
the LP relaxation of the standard IP formulation of the $f$-connectivity
problem with general proper functions $f$. Implementing Jain's algorithm, this
yields a strongly polynomial time $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation for the
generalized survivable network design problem (where we consider rounding up of
rationals an arithmetic operation).

 <dc:title>Lossless Intra Coding in HEVC with Adaptive 3-tap Filters</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alvar, Saeed Ranjbar</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In pixel-by-pixel spatial prediction methods for lossless intra coding, the
prediction is obtained by a weighted sum of neighbouring pixels. The proposed
prediction approach in this paper uses a weighted sum of three neighbor pixels
according to a two-dimensional correlation model. The weights are obtained
after a three step optimization procedure. The first two stages are offline
procedures where the computed prediction weights are obtained offline from
training sequences. The third stage is an online optimization procedure where
the offline obtained prediction weights are further fine-tuned and adapted to
each encoded block during encoding using a rate-distortion optimized method and
the modification in this third stage is transmitted to the decoder as side
information. The results of the simulations show average bit rate reductions of
12.02% and 3.28% over the default lossless intra coding in HEVC and the
well-known Sample-based Angular Prediction (SAP) method, respectively.

 <dc:title>Multi-Fold Gabor, PCA and ICA Filter Convolution Descriptor for Face

 <dc:creator>Ng, Cong Jie</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper devises a new means of filter diversification, dubbed multi-fold
filter convolution (M-FFC), for face recognition. On the assumption that M-FFC
receives single-scale Gabor filters of varying orientations as input, these
filters are self-cross convolved by M-fold to instantiate a filter offspring
set. The M-FFC flexibility also permits cross convolution amongst Gabor filters
and other filter banks of profoundly dissimilar traits, e.g., principal
component analysis (PCA) filters, and independent component analysis (ICA)
filters. The 2-FFC of Gabor, PCA and ICA filters thus yields three offspring
sets: (1) Gabor filters solely, (2) Gabor-PCA filters, and (3) Gabor-ICA
filters, to render the learning-free and the learning-based 2-FFC descriptors.
To facilitate a sensible Gabor filter selection for M-FFC, the 40 multi-scale,
multi-orientation Gabor filters are condensed into 8 elementary filters. Aside
from that, an average histogram pooling operator is employed to leverage the
2-FFC histogram features, prior to the final whitening PCA compression. The
empirical results substantiate that the 2-FFC descriptors prevail over, or on
par with, other face descriptors on both identification and verification tasks.

 <dc:description>  A Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system which identifies similar
medical images based on a query image can assist clinicians for more accurate
diagnosis. The recent CBIR research trend favors the construction and use of
binary codes to represent images. Deep architectures could learn the non-linear
relationship among image pixels adaptively, allowing the automatic learning of
high-level features from raw pixels. However, most of them require class
labels, which are expensive to obtain, particularly for medical images. The
methods which do not need class labels utilize a deep autoencoder for binary
hashing, but the code construction involves a specific training algorithm and
an ad-hoc regularization technique. In this study, we explored using a deep
de-noising autoencoder (DDA), with a new unsupervised training scheme using
only backpropagation and dropout, to hash images into binary codes. We
conducted experiments on more than 14,000 x-ray images. By using class labels
only for evaluating the retrieval results, we constructed a 16-bit DDA and a
512-bit DDA independently. Comparing to other unsupervised methods, we
succeeded to obtain the lowest total error by using the 512-bit codes for
retrieval via exhaustive search, and speed up 9.27 times with the use of the
16-bit codes while keeping a comparable total error. We found that our new
training scheme could reduce the total retrieval error significantly by 21.9%.
To further boost the image retrieval performance, we developed Radon
Autoencoder Barcode (RABC) which are learned from the Radon projections of
images using a de-noising autoencoder. Experimental results demonstrated its
superior performance in retrieval when it was combined with DDA binary codes.

 <dc:title>The Dichotomy for Conservative Constraint Satisfaction is Polynomially

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a fixed constraint language $\Gamma$, the conservative CSP over
$\Gamma$ (denoted by c-CSP($\Gamma$)) is a variant of CSP($\Gamma$) where the
domain of each variable can be restricted arbitrarily. A dichotomy is known for
conservative CSP: for every fixed language $\Gamma$, c-CSP($\Gamma$) is either
in P or NP-complete. However, the characterization of conservatively tractable
languages is of algebraic nature and the naive recognition algorithm is
super-exponential in the domain size. The main contribution of this paper is a
polynomial-time algorithm that, given a constraint language $\Gamma$ as input,
decides if c-CSP($\Gamma$) is tractable. In addition, if $\Gamma$ is proven
tractable the algorithm also outputs its coloured graph, which contains
valuable information on the structure of $\Gamma$.

 <dc:description>  In Boolean synthesis, we are given an LTL specification, and the goal is to
construct a transducer that realizes it against an adversarial environment.
Often, a specification contains both Boolean requirements that should be
satisfied against an adversarial environment, and multi-valued components that
refer to the quality of the satisfaction and whose expected cost we would like
to minimize with respect to a probabilistic environment.
  In this work we study, for the first time, mean-payoff games in which the
system aims at minimizing the expected cost against a probabilistic
environment, while surely satisfying an $\omega$-regular condition against an
adversarial environment. We consider the case the $\omega$-regular condition is
given as a parity objective or by an LTL formula. We show that in general,
optimal strategies need not exist, and moreover, the limit value cannot be
approximated by finite-memory strategies. We thus focus on computing the
limit-value, and give tight complexity bounds for synthesizing
$\epsilon$-optimal strategies for both finite-memory and infinite-memory
strategies.
  We show that our game naturally arises in various contexts of synthesis with
Boolean and multi-valued objectives. Beyond direct applications, in synthesis
with costs and rewards to certain behaviors, it allows us to compute the
minimal sensing cost of $\omega$-regular specifications -- a measure of quality
in which we look for a transducer that minimizes the expected number of signals
that are read from the input.

 <dc:description>  The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a powerful
optimization solver in machine learning. Recently, stochastic ADMM has been
integrated with variance reduction methods for stochastic gradient, leading to
SAG-ADMM and SDCA-ADMM that have fast convergence rates and low iteration
complexities. However, their space requirements can still be high. In this
paper, we propose an integration of ADMM with the method of stochastic variance
reduced gradient (SVRG). Unlike another recent integration attempt called
SCAS-ADMM, the proposed algorithm retains the fast convergence benefits of
SAG-ADMM and SDCA-ADMM, but is more advantageous in that its storage
requirement is very low, even independent of the sample size $n$. We also
extend the proposed method for nonconvex problems, and obtain a convergence
rate of $O(1/T)$. Experimental results demonstrate that it is as fast as
SAG-ADMM and SDCA-ADMM, much faster than SCAS-ADMM, and can be used on much
bigger data sets.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses the need to devise novel strategies to create smart
services specifically designed to non-metropolitan areas, i.e. countrysides.
These solutions must be viable, cheap an should take into consideration the
different nature of countrysides, that cannot afford the deployment of services
designed for smart cities. These solutions would have an important social
impact for people leaving in these countrysides, and might slow down the
constant migration of citizens towards metropolis. In this work, we focus on
communication technologies and practical technological/software distributed
architectures. An important aspect for the real deployment of these smart
shires is their simulation. We show that priority-based broadcast schemes over
ad-hoc networks can represent an effective communication substrate to be used
in a software middleware promoting the creation of applications for smart shire
scenarios.

 <dc:description>  We study novel variations of Voronoi games and associated random processes
that we call Voronoi choice games. These games provide a rich framework for
studying questions regarding the power of small numbers of choices in
multi-player, competitive scenarios, and they further lead to many interesting,
non-trivial random processes that appear worthy of study.
  As an example of the type of problem we study, suppose a group of $n$ miners
are staking land claims through the following process: each miner has $m$
associated points independently and uniformly distributed on an underlying
space, so the $k$th miner will have associated points
$p_{k1},p_{k2},\ldots,p_{km}$. Each miner chooses one of these points as the
base point for their claim. Each miner obtains mining rights for the area of
the square that is closest to their chosen base, that is, they obtain the
Voronoi cell corresponding to their chosen point in the Voronoi diagram of the
$n$ chosen points. Each player's goal is simply to maximize the amount of land
under their control. What can we say about the players' strategy and the
equilibria of such games?
  In our main result, we derive bounds on the expected number of pure Nash
equilibria for a variation of the 1-dimensional game on the circle where a
player owns the arc starting from their point and moving clockwise to the next
point. This result uses interesting properties of random arc lengths on
circles, and demonstrates the challenges in analyzing these kinds of problems.
We also provide several other related results. In particular, for the
1-dimensional game on the circle, we show that a pure Nash equilibrium always
exists when each player owns the part of the circle nearest to their point, but
it is NP-hard to determine whether a pure Nash equilibrium exists in the
variant when each player owns the arc starting from their point clockwise to
the next point.

 <dc:description>  How can we optimally trade extra computing power to reduce the communication
load in distributed computing? We answer this question by characterizing a
fundamental tradeoff between computation and communication in distributed
computing, i.e., the two are inversely proportional to each other.
  More specifically, a general distributed computing framework, motivated by
commonly used structures like MapReduce, is considered, where the overall
computation is decomposed into computing a set of &quot;Map&quot; and &quot;Reduce&quot; functions
distributedly across multiple computing nodes. A coded scheme, named &quot;Coded
Distributed Computing&quot; (CDC), is proposed to demonstrate that increasing the
computation load of the Map functions by a factor of $r$ (i.e., evaluating each
function at $r$ carefully chosen nodes) can create novel coding opportunities
that reduce the communication load by the same factor.
  An information-theoretic lower bound on the communication load is also
provided, which matches the communication load achieved by the CDC scheme. As a
result, the optimal computation-communication tradeoff in distributed computing
is exactly characterized.
  Finally, the coding techniques of CDC is applied to the Hadoop TeraSort
benchmark to develop a novel CodedTeraSort algorithm, which is empirically
demonstrated to speed up the overall job execution by $1.97\times$ -
$3.39\times$, for typical settings of interest.

 <dc:description>  We consider a distributed caching device-to-device (D2D) network in which a
user's file of interest is cached as several portions in the storage of other
devices in the network. Assuming that the user needs to obtain all these file
portions, the portions cached farther away naturally become the performance
bottleneck. This is due to the fact that dominant interferers may be closer to
the receiver than the serving device. Using a simple stochastic geometry model,
we concretely demonstrate that this bottleneck can be loosened if the users are
mobile. Gains obtained from mobility are quantified in terms of coverage
probability.

 <dc:description>  Co-saliency detection is a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area
in computer vision community. As a novel branch of visual saliency, co-saliency
detection refers to the discovery of common and salient foregrounds from two or
more relevant images, and can be widely used in many computer vision tasks. The
existing co-saliency detection algorithms mainly consist of three components:
extracting effective features to represent the image regions, exploring the
informative cues or factors to characterize co-saliency, and designing
effective computational frameworks to formulate co-saliency. Although numerous
methods have been developed, the literature is still lacking a deep review and
evaluation of co-saliency detection techniques. In this paper, we aim at
providing a comprehensive review of the fundamentals, challenges, and
applications of co-saliency detection. Specifically, we provide an overview of
some related computer vision works, review the history of co-saliency
detection, summarize and categorize the major algorithms in this research area,
discuss some open issues in this area, present the potential applications of
co-saliency detection, and finally point out some unsolved challenges and
promising future works. We expect this review to be beneficial to both fresh
and senior researchers in this field, and give insights to researchers in other
related areas regarding the utility of co-saliency detection algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Despite significant progress in object categorization, in recent years, a
number of important challenges remain, mainly, ability to learn from limited
labeled data and ability to recognize object classes within large, potentially
open, set of labels. Zero-shot learning is one way of addressing these
challenges, but it has only been shown to work with limited sized class
vocabularies and typically requires separation between supervised and
unsupervised classes, allowing former to inform the latter but not vice versa.
We propose the notion of semi-supervised vocabulary-informed learning to
alleviate the above mentioned challenges and address problems of supervised,
zero-shot and open set recognition using a unified framework. Specifically, we
propose a maximum margin framework for semantic manifold-based recognition that
incorporates distance constraints from (both supervised and unsupervised)
vocabulary atoms, ensuring that labeled samples are projected closest to their
correct prototypes, in the embedding space, than to others. We show that
resulting model shows improvements in supervised, zero-shot, and large open set
recognition, with up to 310K class vocabulary on AwA and ImageNet datasets.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of optimal leader selection in consensus networks under
two performance measures (1) formation coherence when subject to additive
perturbations, as quantified by the steady-state variance of the deviation from
the desired trajectory, and (2) convergence rate to a consensus value. The
objective is to identify the set of $k$ leaders that optimizes the chosen
performance measure. In both cases, an optimal leader set can be found by an
exhaustive search over all possible leader sets; however, this approach is not
scalable to large networks. In recent years, several works have proposed
approximation algorithms to the $k$-leader selection problem, yet the question
of whether there exists an efficient, non-combinatorial method to identify the
optimal leader set remains open. This work takes a first step towards answering
this question. We show that, in one-dimensional weighted graphs, namely path
graphs and ring graphs, the $k$-leader selection problem can be solved in
polynomial time (in both $k$ and the network size $n$). We give an $O(n^3)$
solution for optimal $k$-leader selection in path graphs and an $O(kn^3)$
solution for optimal $k$-leader selection in ring graphs.

 <dc:description>  Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods have proven powerful in planning for
sequential decision-making problems such as Go and video games, but their
performance can be poor when the planning depth and sampling trajectories are
limited or when the rewards are sparse. We present an adaptation of PGRD
(policy-gradient for reward-design) for learning a reward-bonus function to
improve UCT (a MCTS algorithm). Unlike previous applications of PGRD in which
the space of reward-bonus functions was limited to linear functions of
hand-coded state-action-features, we use PGRD with a multi-layer convolutional
neural network to automatically learn features from raw perception as well as
to adapt the non-linear reward-bonus function parameters. We also adopt a
variance-reducing gradient method to improve PGRD's performance. The new method
improves UCT's performance on multiple ATARI games compared to UCT without the
reward bonus. Combining PGRD and Deep Learning in this way should make adapting
rewards for MCTS algorithms far more widely and practically applicable than
before.

 <dc:description>  Drug use by people is on the rise and is of great interest to public health
agencies and law enforcement agencies. As found by the National Survey on Drug
Use and Health, 20 million Americans aged 12 years or older consumed illicit
drugs in the past few 30 days. Given their ubiquity in everyday life, drug
abuse related studies have received much and constant attention. However, most
of the existing studies rely on surveys. Surveys present a fair number of
problems because of their nature. Surveys on sensitive topics such as illicit
drug use may not be answered truthfully by the people taking them. Selecting a
representative sample to survey is another major challenge. In this paper, we
explore the possibility of using big data from social media in order to
understand illicit drug use behaviors. Instagram posts are collected using drug
related terms by analyzing the hashtags supplied with each post. A large and
dynamic dictionary of frequent illicit drug related slang is used to find these
posts. These posts are studied to find common drug consumption behaviors with
regard to time of day and week. Furthermore, by studying the accounts followed
by the users of drug related posts, we hope to discover common interests shared
by drug users.

 <dc:description>  DeepMind's recent spectacular success in using deep convolutional neural nets
and machine learning to build superhuman level agents --- e.g. for Atari games
via deep Q-learning and for the game of Go via Reinforcement Learning ---
raises many questions, including to what extent these methods will succeed in
other domains. In this paper we consider DQL for the game of Hex: after
supervised initialization, we use selfplay to train NeuroHex, an 11-layer CNN
that plays Hex on the 13x13 board. Hex is the classic two-player alternate-turn
stone placement game played on a rhombus of hexagonal cells in which the winner
is whomever connects their two opposing sides. Despite the large action and
state space, our system trains a Q-network capable of strong play with no
search. After two weeks of Q-learning, NeuroHex achieves win-rates of 20.4% as
first player and 2.1% as second player against a 1-second/move version of
MoHex, the current ICGA Olympiad Hex champion. Our data suggests further
improvement might be possible with more training time.

 <dc:description>  A sliding camera inside an orthogonal polygon $P$ is a point guard that
travels back and forth along an orthogonal line segment $\gamma$ in $P$. The
sliding camera $g$ can see a point $p$ in $P$ if the perpendicular from $p$
onto $\gamma$ is inside $P$. In this paper, we give the first constant-factor
approximation algorithm for the problem of guarding $P$ with the minimum number
of sliding cameras. Next, we show that the sliding guards problem is
linear-time solvable if the (suitably defined) dual graph of the polygon has
bounded treewidth. Finally, we study art gallery theorems for sliding cameras,
thus, give upper and lower bounds in terms of the number of guards needed
relative to the number of vertices $n$.

 <dc:title>On $r$-Guarding Thin Orthogonal Polygons</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Biedl, Therese</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mehrabi, Saeed</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Guarding a polygon with few guards is an old and well-studied problem in
computational geometry. Here we consider the following variant: We assume that
the polygon is orthogonal and thin in some sense, and we consider a point $p$
to guard a point $q$ if and only if the minimum axis-aligned rectangle spanned
by $p$ and $q$ is inside the polygon. A simple proof shows that this problem is
NP-hard on orthogonal polygons with holes, even if the polygon is thin. If
there are no holes, then a thin polygon becomes a tree polygon in the sense
that the so-called dual graph of the polygon is a tree. It was known that
finding the minimum set of $r$-guards is polynomial for tree polygons, but the
run-time was $\tilde{O}(n^{17})$. We show here that with a different approach
the running time becomes linear, answering a question posed by Biedl et al.
(SoCG 2011). Furthermore, the approach is much more general, allowing to
specify subsets of points to guard and guards to use, and it generalizes to
polygons with $h$ holes or thickness $K$, becoming fixed-parameter tractable in
$h+K$.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS) algorithm for
dueling bandit problems. As indicated by its name, D-TS selects both the first
and the second candidates according to Thompson Sampling. Specifically, D-TS
maintains a posterior distribution for the preference matrix, and chooses the
pair of arms for comparison by sampling twice from the posterior distribution.
This simple algorithm applies to general Copeland dueling bandits, including
Condorcet dueling bandits as its special case. For general Copeland dueling
bandits, we show that D-TS achieves $O(K^2 \log T)$ regret. For Condorcet
dueling bandits, we further simplify the D-TS algorithm and show that the
simplified D-TS algorithm achieves $O(K \log T + K^2 \log \log T)$ regret.
Simulation results based on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the
efficiency of the proposed D-TS algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Localized Makeup Transfer Network to
automatically recommend the most suitable makeup for a female and synthesis the
makeup on her face. Given a before-makeup face, her most suitable makeup is
determined automatically. Then, both the beforemakeup and the reference faces
are fed into the proposed Deep Transfer Network to generate the after-makeup
face. Our end-to-end makeup transfer network have several nice properties
including: (1) with complete functions: including foundation, lip gloss, and
eye shadow transfer; (2) cosmetic specific: different cosmetics are transferred
in different manners; (3) localized: different cosmetics are applied on
different facial regions; (4) producing naturally looking results without
obvious artifacts; (5) controllable makeup lightness: various results from
light makeup to heavy makeup can be generated. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments show that our network performs much better than the methods of [Guo
and Sim, 2009] and two variants of NerualStyle [Gatys et al., 2015a].

 <dc:description>  From a crowded field with 17 candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
have emerged as the two front-runners in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.
The two candidates each boast more than 5 million followers on Twitter, and at
the same time both have witnessed hundreds of thousands of people leave their
camps. In this paper we attempt to characterize individuals who have left
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump between September 2015 and March 2016.
  Our study focuses on three dimensions of social demographics: social capital,
gender, and age. Within each camp, we compare the characteristics of the
current followers with former followers, i.e., individuals who have left since
September 2015. We use the number of followers to measure social capital, and
profile images to infer gender and age. For classifying gender, we train a
convolutional neural network (CNN). For age, we use the Face++ API.
  Our study shows that for both candidates followers with more social capital
are more likely to leave (or switch camps). For both candidates females make up
a larger presence among unfollowers than among current followers. Somewhat
surprisingly, the effect is particularly pronounced for Clinton. Lastly,
middle-aged individuals are more likely to leave Trump, and the young are more
likely to leave Hillary Clinton.

 <dc:description>  We present a model for evolving agents using both genetic and cultural
inheritance mechanisms. Within each agent our model maintains two distinct
information stores we call the genome and the memome. Processes of adaptation
are modeled as evolutionary processes at each level of adaptation
(phylogenetic, ontogenetic, sociogenetic). We review relevant competing models
and we show how our model improves on previous attempts to model genetic and
cultural evolutionary processes. In particular we argue our model can achieve
divergent gene-culture co-evolution.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we review the different memristive threshold logic (MTL)
circuits that are inspired from the synaptic action of flow of
neurotransmitters in the biological brain. Brain like generalisation ability
and area minimisation of these threshold logic circuits aim towards crossing
the Moores law boundaries at device, circuits and systems levels.Fast switching
memory, signal processing, control systems, programmable logic, image
processing, reconfigurable computing, and pattern recognition are identified as
some of the potential applications of MTL systems. The physical realization of
nanoscale devices with memristive behaviour from materials like TiO2,
ferroelectrics, silicon, and polymers has accelerated research effort in these
application areas inspiring the scientific community to pursue design of high
speed, low cost, low power and high density neuromorphic architectures.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a multi-user resource allocation framework using
fragmented-spectrum synchronous OFDM-CDMA modulation over a frequency-selective
fading channel. In particular, given pre-existing communications in the
spectrum where the system is operating, a channel sensing and estimation method
is used to obtain information of subcarrier availability. Given this
information, some real-valued multi-level orthogonal codes, which are
orthogonal codes with values of $\{\pm1,\pm2,\pm3,\pm4, ... \}$, are provided
for emerging new users, i.e., cognitive radio users. Additionally, we have
obtained a closed form expression for bit error rate of cognitive radio
receivers in terms of detection probability of primary users, CR users' sensing
time and CR users' signal to noise ratio. Moreover, simulation results obtained
in this paper indicate the precision with which the analytical results have
been obtained in modeling the aforementioned system.

 <dc:title>Worst-case Complexity of Cyclic Coordinate Descent: $O(n^2)$ Gap with
  Randomized Version</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sun, Ruoyu</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ye, Yinyu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper concerns the worst-case complexity of Gauss-Seidel method for
solving a positive semi-definite linear system; or equivalently, that of cyclic
coordinate descent (C-CD) for minimizing a convex quadratic function. The known
provable complexity of C-CD can be $O(n)$ times slower than gradient descent
(GD) and $O(n^2)$ times slower than randomized coordinate descent (R-CD).
However, these gaps seem rather puzzling since so far they have not been
observed in practice; in fact, C-CD usually converges much faster than GD and
sometimes comparable to R-CD. Thus some researchers believe the gaps are due to
the weakness of the proof, but not that of the C-CD algorithm itself.
  In this paper we show that the gaps indeed exist. We prove that there exists
an example for which C-CD takes at least $\tilde{O}(n^3\kappa)$ or
$\tilde{O}(n^4 \kappa_{\text{CD}})$ operations, where $\kappa$ is the condition
number, $\kappa_{\text{CD}}$ is a well-studied quantity that determines the
convergence rate of R-CD, and $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides the dependency on $\log
1/\epsilon$. This implies that C-CD can indeed be $O(n)$ times slower than GD,
and $O(n^2)$ times slower than R-CD in the worst case. Our result establishes
one of the few examples in continuous optimization that demonstrates a large
gap between a deterministic algorithm and its randomized counterpart. Based on
the example, we establish several almost tight complexity bounds of C-CD for
quadratic problems. One difficulty with the analysis of the constructed example
is that the spectral radius of a non-symmetric iteration matrix does not
necessarily constitutes a lower bound for the convergence rate.

 <dc:title>An integral-transform approach to the bioheat transfer problems in

 <dc:creator>Murase, Kenya</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Physics - Medical Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Our purpose in this study was to present an integral-transform approach to
the analytical solutions of the Pennes's bioheat transfer equation and to apply
it to the calculation of temperature distribution in tissues in hyperthermia
with magnetic nanoparticles (magnetic hyperthermia). The validity of our method
was investigated by comparison with the analytical solutions obtained by the
Green's function method for point and shell heat sources and the numerical
solutions obtained by the finite-difference method for Gaussin-distributed and
step-function sources. There was good agreement between the radial profiles of
temperature calculated by our method and those obtained by the Green's function
method. There was also good agreement between our method and the
finite-difference method except for the central temperature for a step-function
source that had approximately a 0.3% difference. We also found that the
equations describing the steady-state solutions for point and shell sources
obtained by our method agreed with those obtained by the Green's function
method. These results appear to indicate the validity of our method. In
conclusion, we presented an integral-transform approach to the bioheat transfer
problems in magnetic hyperthermia, and this study demonstrated the validity of
our method. The analytical solutions presented in this study will be useful for
gaining some insight into the heat diffusion process during magnetic
hyperthermia, for testing numerical codes and/or more complcated approaches,
and for performing sensitivity analysis and optimization of the parameters that
affect the thermal diffusion process in magnetic hyperthermia.

 <dc:description>  The proliferation of Social Network Sites (SNSs) has greatly reformed the way
of information dissemination, but also provided a new venue for hosts with
impure motivations to disseminate malicious information. Social trust is the
basis for information dissemination in SNSs. Malicious hosts judiciously and
dynamically make the balance between maintaining its social trust and selfishly
maximizing its malicious gain over a long time-span. Studying the optimal
response strategies for each malicious host could assist to design the best
system maneuver so as to achieve the targeted level of overall malicious
activities. In this paper, we propose an interaction-based social trust model,
and formulate the maximization of long-term malicious gains of multiple
competing hosts as a non-cooperative differential game. Through rigorous
analysis, optimal response strategies are identified and the best system
maneuver mechanism is presented. Extensive numerical studies further verify the
analytical results.

 <dc:description>  Given an ensemble of randomized regression trees, it is possible to
restructure them as a collection of multilayered neural networks with
particular connection weights. Following this principle, we reformulate the
random forest method of Breiman (2001) into a neural network setting, and in
turn propose two new hybrid procedures that we call neural random forests. Both
predictors exploit prior knowledge of regression trees for their architecture,
have less parameters to tune than standard networks, and less restrictions on
the geometry of the decision boundaries. Consistency results are proved, and
substantial numerical evidence is provided on both synthetic and real data sets
to assess the excellent performance of our methods in a large variety of
prediction problems.

 <dc:title>Achievable Moderate Deviations Asymptotics for Streaming Compression of

 <dc:description>  Motivated by streaming multi-view video coding and wireless sensor networks,
we consider the problem of blockwise streaming compression of a pair of
correlated sources, which we term streaming Slepian-Wolf coding. We study the
moderate deviations regime in which the rate pairs of a sequence of codes
converge, along a straight line, to various points on the boundary of the
Slepian-Wolf region at a speed slower than the inverse square root of the
blocklength $n$, while the error probability decays subexponentially fast in
$n$. Our main result focuses on directions of approaches to corner points of
the Slepian-Wolf region. It states that for each correlated source and all
corner points, there exists a non-empty subset of directions of approaches such
that the moderate deviations constant (the constant of proportionality for the
subexponential decay of the error probability) is enhanced (over the
non-streaming case) by at least a factor of $T$, the block delay of decoding
source block pairs. We specialize our main result to the setting of streaming
lossless source coding and generalize this result to the setting where we have
different delay requirements for each of the two source blocks. The proof of
our main result involves the use of various analytical tools and amalgamates
several ideas from the recent information-theoretic streaming literature. We
adapt the so-called truncated memory encoding idea from Draper and Khisti
(2011) and Lee, Tan, and Khisti (2016) to ensure that the effect of error
accumulation is nullified in the limit of large blocklengths. We also adapt the
use of the so-called minimum weighted empirical suffix entropy decoder which
was used by Draper, Chang, and Sahai (2014) to derive achievable error
exponents for symbolwise streaming Slepian-Wolf coding.

 <dc:title>Closing the Gap for Makespan Scheduling via Sparsification Techniques</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Makespan scheduling on identical machines is one of the most basic and
fundamental packing problems studied in the discrete optimization literature.
It asks for an assignment of $n$ jobs to a set of $m$ identical machines that
minimizes the makespan. The problem is strongly NP-hard, and thus we do not
expect a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with a running time that
depends polynomially on $1/\epsilon$. Furthermore, Chen et al. [3] recently
showed that a running time of $2^{(1/\epsilon)^{1-\delta}}+\text{poly}(n)$ for
any $\delta&gt;0$ would imply that the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. A
long sequence of algorithms have been developed that try to obtain low
dependencies on $1/\epsilon$, the better of which achieves a running time of
$2^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)}+O(n\log n)$ [11]. In this paper we obtain an
algorithm with a running time of $2^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)}+O(n\log n)$, which
is tight under ETH up to logarithmic factors on the exponent.
  Our main technical contribution is a new structural result on the
configuration-IP. More precisely, we show the existence of a highly symmetric
and sparse optimal solution, in which all but a constant number of machines are
assigned a configuration with small support. This structure can then be
exploited by integer programming techniques and enumeration. We believe that
our structural result is of independent interest and should find applications
to other settings. In particular, we show how the structure can be applied to
the minimum makespan problem on related machines and to a larger class of
objective functions on parallel machines. For all these cases we obtain an
efficient PTAS with running time $2^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)} + \text{poly}(n)$.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the downlink in a K-tier heterogeneous network in
the presence of Nakagami-m fading and noise. For such a system, we derive
closed-form approximations of coverage probability and average rate achievable.
A piece-wise linear approximation is employed in obtaining the simplified
expressions. The proposed results are verified numerically through simulations.
A comparison with existing work shows that the proposed work is a good
approximation.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel method for Acoustic Event Detection (AED). In contrast to
speech, sounds coming from acoustic events may be produced by a wide variety of
sources. Furthermore, distinguishing them often requires analyzing an extended
time period due to the lack of a clear sub-word unit. In order to incorporate
the long-time frequency structure for AED, we introduce a convolutional neural
network (CNN) with a large input field. In contrast to previous works, this
enables to train audio event detection end-to-end. Our architecture is inspired
by the success of VGGNet and uses small, 3x3 convolutions, but more depth than
previous methods in AED. In order to prevent over-fitting and to take full
advantage of the modeling capabilities of our network, we further propose a
novel data augmentation method to introduce data variation. Experimental
results show that our CNN significantly outperforms state of the art methods
including Bag of Audio Words (BoAW) and classical CNNs, achieving a 16%
absolute improvement.

 <dc:description>  Elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) frequently arise in continuum
descriptions of physical processes relevant to science and engineering.
Multilevel preconditioners represent a family of scalable techniques for
solving discrete PDEs of this type and thus are the method of choice for
high-resolution simulations. The scalability and time-to-solution of massively
parallel multilevel preconditioners can be adversely effected by using a
coarse-level solver with sub-optimal algorithmic complexity. To maintain
scalability, agglomeration techniques applied to the coarse level have been
shown to be necessary.
  In this work, we present a new software component introduced within the
Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computation (PETSc) which permits
agglomeration. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of this
functionality, together with several use cases highlighting the benefits of
agglomeration. Lastly, we demonstrate via numerical experiments employing
geometric multigrid with structured meshes, the flexibility and performance
gains possible using our MPI-rank agglomeration implementation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study information cascades on graphs. In this setting, each
node in the graph represents a person. One after another, each person has to
take a decision based on a private signal as well as the decisions made by
earlier neighboring nodes. Such information cascades commonly occur in practice
and have been studied in complete graphs where everyone can overhear the
decisions of every other player. It is known that information cascades can be
fragile and based on very little information, and that they have a high
likelihood of being wrong.
  Generalizing the problem to arbitrary graphs reveals interesting insights. In
particular, we show that in a random graph $G(n,q)$, for the right value of
$q$, the number of nodes making a wrong decision is logarithmic in $n$. That
is, in the limit for large $n$, the fraction of players that make a wrong
decision tends to zero. This is intriguing because it contrasts to the two
natural corner cases: empty graph (everyone decides independently based on his
private signal) and complete graph (all decisions are heard by all nodes). In
both of these cases a constant fraction of nodes make a wrong decision in
expectation. Thus, our result shows that while both too little and too much
information sharing causes nodes to take wrong decisions, for exactly the right
amount of information sharing, asymptotically everyone can be right. We further
show that this result in random graphs is asymptotically optimal for any
topology, even if nodes follow a globally optimal algorithmic strategy. Based
on the analysis of random graphs, we explore how topology impacts global
performance and construct an optimal deterministic topology among layer graphs.

 <dc:description>  We consider nondeterministic probabilistic programs with the most basic
liveness property of termination. We present efficient methods for termination
analysis of nondeterministic probabilistic programs with polynomial guards and
assignments. Our approach is through synthesis of polynomial ranking
supermartingales, that on one hand significantly generalizes linear ranking
supermartingales and on the other hand is a counterpart of polynomial
ranking-functions for proving termination of nonprobabilistic programs. The
approach synthesizes polynomial ranking-supermartingales through
Positivstellensatz's, yielding an efficient method which is not only sound, but
also semi-complete over a large subclass of programs. We show experimental
results to demonstrate that our approach can handle several classical programs
with complex polynomial guards and assignments, and can synthesize efficient
quadratic ranking-supermartingales when a linear one does not exist even for
simple affine programs.

 <dc:description>  Protein secondary structure prediction is an important problem in
bioinformatics. Inspired by the recent successes of deep neural networks, in
this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep network that predicts protein
secondary structures from integrated local and global contextual features. Our
deep architecture leverages convolutional neural networks with different kernel
sizes to extract multiscale local contextual features. In addition, considering
long-range dependencies existing in amino acid sequences, we set up a
bidirectional neural network consisting of gated recurrent unit to capture
global contextual features. Furthermore, multi-task learning is utilized to
predict secondary structure labels and amino-acid solvent accessibility
simultaneously. Our proposed deep network demonstrates its effectiveness by
achieving state-of-the-art performance, i.e., 69.7% Q8 accuracy on the public
benchmark CB513, 76.9% Q8 accuracy on CASP10 and 73.1% Q8 accuracy on CASP11.
Our model and results are publicly available.

 <dc:description>  Clustering explores meaningful patterns in the non-labeled data sets. Cluster
Ensemble Selection (CES) is a new approach, which can combine individual
clustering results for increasing the performance of the final results.
Although CES can achieve better final results in comparison with individual
clustering algorithms and cluster ensemble methods, its performance can be
dramatically affected by its consensus diversity metric and thresholding
procedure. There are two problems in CES: 1) most of the diversity metrics is
based on heuristic Shannon's entropy and 2) estimating threshold values are
really hard in practice. The main goal of this paper is proposing a robust
approach for solving the above mentioned problems. Accordingly, this paper
develops a novel framework for clustering problems, which is called Weighted
Spectral Cluster Ensemble (WSCE), by exploiting some concepts from community
detection arena and graph based clustering. Under this framework, a new version
of spectral clustering, which is called Two Kernels Spectral Clustering, is
used for generating graphs based individual clustering results. Further, by
using modularity, which is a famous metric in the community detection, on the
transformed graph representation of individual clustering results, our approach
provides an effective diversity estimation for individual clustering results.
Moreover, this paper introduces a new approach for combining the evaluated
individual clustering results without the procedure of thresholding.
Experimental study on varied data sets demonstrates that the prosed approach
achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Wireless ad hoc networks, in particular mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), are
growing very fast as they make communication easier and more available.
However, their protocols tend to be difficult to design due to topology
dependent behavior of wireless communication, and their distributed and
adaptive operations to topology dynamism. Therefore, it is desirable to have
them modeled and verified using formal methods. In this paper, we present an
actor-based modeling language with the aim to model MANETs. We address main
challenges of modeling wireless ad hoc networks such as local broadcast,
underlying topology, and its changes, and discuss how they can be efficiently
modeled at the semantic level to make their verification amenable. The new
framework abstracts the data link layer services by providing asynchronous
(local) broadcast and unicast communication, while message delivery is in order
and is guaranteed for connected receivers. We illustrate the applicability of
our framework through two routing protocols, namely flooding and AODVv2-11, and
show how efficiently their state spaces can be reduced by the proposed
techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrate a loop formation scenario in AODV,
found by our analysis tool.

 <dc:description>  We examine the utility of multiple channels of communication in wireless
networks under the SINR model of interference. The central question is whether
the use of multiple channels can result in linear speedup, up to some
fundamental limit. We answer this question affirmatively for the data
aggregation problem, perhaps the most fundamental problem in sensor networks.
To achieve this, we form a hierarchical structure of independent interest, and
illustrate its versatility by obtaining a new algorithm with linear speedup for
the node coloring problem.

database perspective. We separate strong beliefs from weak beliefs. Strong
beliefs are independent from intentions, while weak beliefs are obtained by
adding intentions to strong beliefs and everything that follows from that. We
formalize coherence conditions on strong beliefs and intentions. We provide
AGM-style postulates for the revision of strong beliefs and intentions. We show
in a representation theorem that a revision operator satisfying our postulates
can be represented by a pre-order on interpretations of the beliefs, together
with a selection function for the intentions.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we study the following basic question: &quot;How much parallelism
does a distributed task permit?&quot; Our definition of parallelism (or symmetry)
here is not in terms of speed, but in terms of identical roles that processes
have at the same time in the execution. We initiate this study in population
protocols, a very simple model that not only allows for a straightforward
definition of what a role is, but also encloses the challenge of isolating the
properties that are due to the protocol from those that are due to the
adversary scheduler, who controls the interactions between the processes. We
(i) give a partial characterization of the set of predicates on input
assignments that can be stably computed with maximum symmetry, i.e.,
$\Theta(N_{min})$, where $N_{min}$ is the minimum multiplicity of a state in
the initial configuration, and (ii) we turn our attention to the remaining
predicates and prove a strong impossibility result for the parity predicate:
the inherent symmetry of any protocol that stably computes it is upper bounded
by a constant that depends on the size of the protocol.

 <dc:description>  We characterize the complexity of the PATS problem for patterns of fixed
height and color count in variants of the model where seed glues are either
chosen or fixed and identical (so-called non-uniform and uniform variants). We
prove that both variants are NP-complete for patterns of height 2 or more and
admit O(n)-time algorithms for patterns of height 1. We also prove that if the
height and number of colors in the pattern is fixed, the non-uniform variant
admits a O(n)-time algorithm while the uniform variant remains NP-complete. The
NP-completeness results use a new reduction from a constrained version of a
problem on finite state transducers.

 <dc:description>  Performance analyses of subspace algorithms for cisoid parameter estimation
available in the literature are predominantly of statistical nature with a
focus on asymptotic$-$either in the sample size or the SNR$-$statements. This
paper presents a deterministic, finite sample size, and finite-SNR performance
analysis of the ESPRIT algorithm and the matrix pencil method. Our results are
based, inter alia, on a new upper bound on the condition number of Vandermonde
matrices with nodes inside the unit disk. This bound is obtained through a
generalization of Hilbert's inequality frequently used in large sieve theory.

 <dc:title>Characterization and Lower Bounds for Branching Program Size using
  Projective Dimension</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dinesh, Krishnamoorthy</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  We study projective dimension, a graph parameter (denoted by pd$(G)$ for a
graph $G$), introduced by (Pudl\'ak, R\&quot;odl 1992), who showed that proving
lower bounds for pd$(G_f)$ for bipartite graphs $G_f$ associated with a Boolean
function $f$ imply size lower bounds for branching programs computing $f$.
Despite several attempts (Pudl\'ak, R\&quot;odl 1992 ; Babai, R\'{o}nyai, Ganapathy
2000), proving super-linear lower bounds for projective dimension of explicit
families of graphs has remained elusive.
  We show that there exist a Boolean function $f$ (on $n$ bits) for which the
gap between the projective dimension and size of the optimal branching program
computing $f$ (denoted by bpsize$(f)$), is $2^{\Omega(n)}$. Motivated by the
argument in (Pudl\'ak, R\&quot;odl 1992), we define two variants of projective
dimension - projective dimension with intersection dimension 1 (denoted by
upd$(G)$) and bitwise decomposable projective dimension (denoted by
bitpdim$(G)$).
  As our main result, we show that there is an explicit family of graphs on $N
= 2^n$ vertices such that the projective dimension is $O(\sqrt{n})$, the
projective dimension with intersection dimension $1$ is $\Omega(n)$ and the
bitwise decomposable projective dimension is $\Omega(\frac{n^{1.5}}{\log n})$.
We also show that there exist a Boolean function $f$ (on $n$ bits) for which
the gap between upd$(G_f)$ and bpsize$(f)$ is $2^{\Omega(n)}$. In contrast, we
also show that the bitwise decomposable projective dimension characterizes size
of the branching program up to a polynomial factor. That is, there exists a
constant $c&gt;0$ and for any function $f$, $\textrm{bitpdim}(G_f)/6 \le
\textrm{bpsize}(f) \le (\textrm{bitpdim}(G_f))^c$. We also study two other
variants of projective dimension and show that they are exactly equal to
well-studied graph parameters - bipartite clique cover number and bipartite
partition number respectively.

 <dc:description>  The template-based method is one of the most successful approaches to
algebraic invariant synthesis. In this method, an algorithm designates a
template polynomial p over program variables, generates constraints for p=0 to
be an invariant, and solves the generated constraints. However, this approach
often suffers from an increasing template size if the degree of a template
polynomial is too high.
  We propose a technique to make template-based methods more efficient. Our
technique is based on the following finding: If an algebraic invariant exists,
then there is a specific algebraic invariant that we call a generalized
homogeneous algebraic invariant that is often smaller. This finding justifies
using only a smaller template that corresponds to a generalized homogeneous
algebraic invariant.
  Concretely, we state our finding above formally based on the abstract
semantics of an imperative program proposed by Cachera et al. Then, we modify
their template-based invariant synthesis so that it generates only generalized
homogeneous algebraic invariants. This modification is proved to be sound.
Furthermore, we also empirically demonstrate the merit of the restriction to
generalized homogeneous algebraic invariants. Our implementation outperforms
that of Cachera et al. for programs that require a higher-degree template.

 <dc:description>  Mining medical datasets is a challenging problem before data mining
researchers as these datasets have several hidden challenges compared to
conventional datasets.Starting from the collection of samples through field
experiments and clinical trials to performing classification,there are numerous
challenges at every stage in the mining process. The preprocessing phase in the
mining process itself is a challenging issue when, we work on medical datasets.
One of the prime challenges in mining medical datasets is handling missing
values which is part of preprocessing phase. In this paper, we address the
issue of handling missing values in medical dataset consisting of categorical
attribute values. The main contribution of this research is to use the proposed
imputation measure to estimate and fix the missing values. We discuss a case
study to demonstrate the working of proposed measure.

 <dc:description>  Eliciting relevance judgments for ranking evaluation is labor-intensive and
costly, motivating careful selection of which documents to judge. Unlike
traditional approaches that make this selection deterministically,
probabilistic sampling has shown intriguing promise since it enables the design
of estimators that are provably unbiased even when reusing data with missing
judgments. In this paper, we first unify and extend these sampling approaches
by viewing the evaluation problem as a Monte Carlo estimation task that applies
to a large number of common IR metrics. Drawing on the theoretical clarity that
this view offers, we tackle three practical evaluation scenarios: comparing two
systems, comparing $k$ systems against a baseline, and ranking $k$ systems. For
each scenario, we derive an estimator and a variance-optimizing sampling
distribution while retaining the strengths of sampling-based evaluation,
including unbiasedness, reusability despite missing data, and ease of use in
practice. In addition to the theoretical contribution, we empirically evaluate
our methods against previously used sampling heuristics and find that they
generally cut the number of required relevance judgments at least in half.

 <dc:description>  We have developed reduced reference parametric models for estimating
perceived quality in audiovisual multimedia services. We have created 144
unique configurations for audiovisual content including various application and
network parameters such as bitrates and distortions in terms of bandwidth,
packet loss rate and jitter. To generate the data needed for model training and
validation we have tasked 24 subjects, in a controlled environment, to rate the
overall audiovisual quality on the absolute category rating (ACR) 5-level
quality scale. We have developed models using Random Forest and Neural Network
based machine learning methods in order to estimate Mean Opinion Scores (MOS)
values. We have used information retrieved from the packet headers and side
information provided as network parameters for model training. Random Forest
based models have performed better in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
and Pearson correlation coefficient. The side information proved to be very
effective in developing the model. We have found that, while the model
performance might be improved by replacing the side information with more
accurate bit stream level measurements, they are performing well in estimating
perceived quality in audiovisual multimedia services.

 <dc:description>  We estimate the state a noisy robot arm and underactuated hand using an
Implicit Manifold Particle Filter (MPF) informed by touch sensors. As the robot
touches the world, its state space collapses to a contact manifold that we
represent implicitly using a signed distance field. This allows us to extend
the MPF to higher (six or more) dimensional state spaces. Earlier work (which
explicitly represents the contact manifold) only shows the MPF in two or three
dimensions. Through a series of experiments, we show that the implicit MPF
converges faster and is more accurate than a conventional particle filter
during periods of persistent contact. We present three methods of sampling the
implicit contact manifold, and compare them in experiments.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new version of formula size game for modal logic. The game
characterizes the equivalence of pointed Kripke-models up to formulas of given
numbers of modal operators and binary connectives. Our game is similar to the
well-known Adler-Immerman game. However, due to a crucial difference in the
definition of positions of the game, its winning condition is simpler, and the
second player (duplicator) does not have a trivial optimal strategy. Thus,
unlike the Adler-Immerman game, our game is a genuine two-person game. We
illustrate the use of the game by proving a nonelementary succinctness gap
between bisimulation invariant first-order logic FO and (basic) modal logic ML.

 <dc:description>  Network processes are often represented as signals defined on the vertices of
a graph. To untangle the latent structure of such signals, one can view them as
outputs of linear graph filters modeling underlying network dynamics. This
paper deals with the problem of joint identification of a graph filter and its
input signal, thus broadening the scope of classical blind deconvolution of
temporal and spatial signals to the less-structured graph domain. Given a graph
signal $\mathbf{y}$ modeled as the output of a graph filter, the goal is to
recover the vector of filter coefficients $\mathbf{h}$, and the input signal
$\mathbf{x}$ which is assumed to be sparse. While $\mathbf{y}$ is a bilinear
function of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{h}$, the filtered graph signal is also a
linear combination of the entries of the lifted rank-one, row-sparse matrix
$\mathbf{x} \mathbf{h}^T$. The blind graph-filter identification problem can
thus be tackled via rank and sparsity minimization subject to linear
constraints, an inverse problem amenable to convex relaxations offering
provable recovery guarantees under simplifying assumptions. Numerical tests
using both synthetic and real-world networks illustrate the merits of the
proposed algorithms, as well as the benefits of leveraging multiple signals to
aid the blind identification task.

 <dc:description>  In contrast to much previous work that has focused on location classification
of tweets restricted to a specific country, here we undertake the task in a
broader context by classifying global tweets at the country level, which is so
far unexplored in a real-time scenario. We analyse the extent to which a
tweet's country of origin can be determined by making use of eight
tweet-inherent features for classification. Furthermore, we use two datasets,
collected a year apart from each other, to analyse the extent to which a model
trained from historical tweets can still be leveraged for classification of new
tweets. With classification experiments on all 217 countries in our datasets,
as well as on the top 25 countries, we offer some insights into the best use of
tweet-inherent features for an accurate country-level classification of tweets.
We find that the use of a single feature, such as the use of tweet content
alone -- the most widely used feature in previous work -- leaves much to be
desired. Choosing an appropriate combination of both tweet content and metadata
can actually lead to substantial improvements of between 20\% and 50\%. We
observe that tweet content, the user's self-reported location and the user's
real name, all of which are inherent in a tweet and available in a real-time
scenario, are particularly useful to determine the country of origin. We also
experiment on the applicability of a model trained on historical tweets to
classify new tweets, finding that the choice of a particular combination of
features whose utility does not fade over time can actually lead to comparable
performance, avoiding the need to retrain. However, the difficulty of achieving
accurate classification increases slightly for countries with multiple
commonalities, especially for English and Spanish speaking countries.

 <dc:title>Implementation of $hp$-adaptive discontinuous finite element methods in
  Dune-Fem</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gersbacher, Christoph</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Mathematical Software</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe generic algorithms and data structures for the
implementation of $hp$-adaptive discontinuous finite element methods in the
Dune-Fem library. Special attention is given to the often tedious and
error-prone task of transferring user data during adaptation. Simultaneously,
we generalize the approach to the restriction and prolongation of data
currently implemented in Dune-Fem to the case of $p$- and $hp$-adaptation. The
dune-fem-hpdg module described in this paper provides an extensible reference
implementation of $hp$-adaptive discontinuous discrete function spaces. We give
details on its implementation and the extended adaptive interface. As proof of
concept we present the practical realization of an $hp$-adaptive interior
penalty method for elliptic problems.

 <dc:title>Learning Arbitrary Sum-Product Network Leaves with

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sum-Product Networks with complex probability distribution at the leaves have
been shown to be powerful tractable-inference probabilistic models. However,
while learning the internal parameters has been amply studied, learning complex
leaf distribution is an open problem with only few results available in special
cases. In this paper we derive an efficient method to learn a very large class
of leaf distributions with Expectation-Maximization. The EM updates have the
form of simple weighted maximum likelihood problems, allowing to use any
distribution that can be learned with maximum likelihood, even approximately.
The algorithm has cost linear in the model size and converges even if only
partial optimizations are performed. We demonstrate this approach with
experiments on twenty real-life datasets for density estimation, using tree
graphical models as leaves. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for
parameter learning despite using SPNs with much fewer parameters.

 <dc:description>  We propose a lifelong learning system that has the ability to reuse and
transfer knowledge from one task to another while efficiently retaining the
previously learned knowledge-base. Knowledge is transferred by learning
reusable skills to solve tasks in Minecraft, a popular video game which is an
unsolved and high-dimensional lifelong learning problem. These reusable skills,
which we refer to as Deep Skill Networks, are then incorporated into our novel
Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Network (H-DRLN) architecture using
two techniques: (1) a deep skill array and (2) skill distillation, our novel
variation of policy distillation (Rusu et. al. 2015) for learning skills. Skill
distillation enables the HDRLN to efficiently retain knowledge and therefore
scale in lifelong learning, by accumulating knowledge and encapsulating
multiple reusable skills into a single distilled network. The H-DRLN exhibits
superior performance and lower learning sample complexity compared to the
regular Deep Q Network (Mnih et. al. 2015) in sub-domains of Minecraft.

 <dc:description>  In decentralized systems, nodes often need to coordinate to access shared
resources in a fair manner. One approach to perform such arbitration is to rely
on auction mechanisms. Although there is an extensive literature that studies
auctions, most of these works assume the existence of a central, trusted
auctioneer. Unfortunately, in fully decentralized systems, where the nodes that
need to cooperate operate under separate spheres of control, such central
trusted entity may not exist. Notable examples of such decentralized systems
include community networks, clouds of clouds, cooperative nano data centres,
among others. In this paper, we make theoretical and practical contributions to
distribute the role of the auctioneer. From the theoretical perspective, we
propose a framework of distributed simulations of the auctioneer that are Nash
equilibria resilient to coalitions and asynchrony. From the practical
perspective, our protocols leverage the distributed nature of the simulations
to parallelise the execution. We have implemented a prototype that instantiates
the framework for bandwidth allocation in community networks, and evaluated it
in a real distributed setting.

 <dc:description>  Hyperparameters of deep neural networks are often optimized by grid search,
random search or Bayesian optimization. As an alternative, we propose to use
the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which is known
for its state-of-the-art performance in derivative-free optimization. CMA-ES
has some useful invariance properties and is friendly to parallel evaluations
of solutions. We provide a toy example comparing CMA-ES and state-of-the-art
Bayesian optimization algorithms for tuning the hyperparameters of a
convolutional neural network for the MNIST dataset on 30 GPUs in parallel.

treewidth at most $k$ (or equivalently, the number of labeled partial
$k$-trees), which we denote by $T_{n,k}$. So far, only the particular cases
$T_{n,1}$ and $T_{n,2}$ had been studied. We show that $$ \left(c \cdot
\frac{k\cdot 2^k \cdot n}{\log k} \right)^n \cdot 2^{-\frac{k(k+3)}{2}} \cdot
k^{-2k-2}\ \leq\ T_{n,k}\ \leq\ \left(k \cdot 2^k \cdot n\right)^n \cdot
2^{-\frac{k(k+1)}{2}} \cdot k^{-k}, $$ for $k &gt; 1$ and some explicit absolute
constant $c &gt; 0$. The upper bound is an immediate consequence of the well-known
number of labeled $k$-trees, while the lower bound is obtained from an explicit
algorithmic construction. It follows from this construction that both bounds
also apply to graphs of pathwidth and proper-pathwidth at most $k$.

many areas such as planar drawing, upward planar drawing, planar poset theory,

essentially a combinatorial formulation of Joyal and Street's theory of
graphical calculus. The crux of our approach is a composition theory of
progressive plane graphs and their planar orders, which provides a new method
to calculate the conjugate order of an upward planar st graph.

 <dc:description>  Actionness was introduced to quantify the likelihood of containing a generic
action instance at a specific location. Accurate and efficient estimation of
actionness is important in video analysis and may benefit other relevant tasks
such as action recognition and action detection. This paper presents a new deep
architecture for actionness estimation, called hybrid fully convolutional
network (H-FCN), which is composed of appearance FCN (A-FCN) and motion FCN
(M-FCN). These two FCNs leverage the strong capacity of deep models to estimate
actionness maps from the perspectives of static appearance and dynamic motion,
respectively. In addition, the fully convolutional nature of H-FCN allows it to
efficiently process videos with arbitrary sizes. Experiments are conducted on
the challenging datasets of Stanford40, UCF Sports, and JHMDB to verify the
effectiveness of H-FCN on actionness estimation, which demonstrate that our
method achieves superior performance to previous ones. Moreover, we apply the
estimated actionness maps on action proposal generation and action detection.
Our actionness maps advance the current state-of-the-art performance of these
tasks substantially.

 <dc:title>Phase Retrieval Without Small-Ball Probability Assumptions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the context of the phase retrieval problem, it is known that certain
natural classes of measurements, such as Fourier measurements and random
Bernoulli measurements, do not lead to the unique reconstruction of all
possible signals, even in combination with certain practically feasible random
masks. To avoid this difficulty, the analysis is often restricted to
measurement ensembles (or masks) that satisfy a small-ball probability
condition, in order to ensure that the reconstruction is unique.
  This paper shows a complementary result: for random Bernoulli measurements,
there is still a large class of signals that can be reconstructed uniquely,
namely those signals that are &quot;non-peaky.&quot; In fact, this result is much more
general: it holds for random measurements sampled from any subgaussian
distribution D, without any small-ball conditions. This is demonstrated in two
ways: first, a proof of stability and uniqueness, and second, a uniform
recovery guarantee for the PhaseLift algorithm. In all of these cases, the
number of measurements m approaches the information-theoretic lower bound.
  Finally, for random Bernoulli measurements with erasures, it is shown that
PhaseLift achieves uniform recovery of all signals (including peaky ones).

 <dc:description>  We consider the bin packing problem with $d$ different item sizes and revisit
the structure theorem given by Goemans and Rothvo\ss [6] about solutions of the
integer cone. We present new techniques on how solutions can be modified and
give a new structure theorem that relies on the set of vertices of the
underlying integer polytope. As a result of our new structure theorem, we
obtain an algorithm for the bin packing problem with running time
$|V|^{2^{O(d)}} \cdot enc(I)^{O(1)}$, where $V$ is the set of vertices of the
integer knapsack polytope and $enc(I)$ is the encoding length of the bin
packing instance. The algorithm is fixed parameter tractable, parameterized by
the number of vertices of the integer knapsack polytope $|V|$. This shows that
the bin packing problem can be solved efficiently when the underlying integer
knapsack polytope has an easy structure, i.e. has a small number of vertices.
  Furthermore, we show that the presented bounds of the structure theorem are
asymptotically tight. We give a construction of bin packing instances using new
structural insights and classical number theoretical theorems which yield the
desired lower bound.

 <dc:description>  For any sufficiently strong theory of arithmetic, the set of Diophantine
equations provably unsolvable in the theory is algorithmically undecidable, as
a consequence of the MRDP theorem. In contrast, we show decidability of
Diophantine equations provably unsolvable in Robinson's arithmetic Q. The
argument hinges on an analysis of a particular class of equations, hitherto
unexplored in Diophantine literature. We also axiomatize the universal fragment
of Q in the process.

 <dc:description>  Dou Shou Qi is a game in which two players control a number of pieces, each
of them aiming to move one of their pieces onto a given square. We implemented
an engine for analyzing the game. Moreover, we created a series of endgame
tablebases containing all configurations with up to four pieces. These
tablebases are the first steps towards theoretically solving the game. Finally,
we constructed decision trees based on the endgame tablebases. In this note we
report on some interesting patterns.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce the concept of spatially coupled turbo-like codes
(SC-TCs) as the spatial coupling of a number of turbo-like code ensembles. In
particular, we consider the spatial coupling of Berrou et al. parallel
concatenated codes (PCCs) and Benedetto et al. serially concatenated codes
(SCCs). Furthermore, we propose two extensions of braided convolutional codes
(BCCs), a class of turbo-like codes which have an inherent spatially coupled
structure, to higher coupling memories, and show that these yield improved
belief propagation (BP) thresholds as compared to the original BCC ensemble. We
derive the exact density evolution (DE) equations for SC-TCs and analyze their
asymptotic behavior on the binary erasure channel. We also consider the
construction of families of rate-compatible SC-TC ensembles. Our numerical
results show that threshold saturation of the belief propagation (BP) decoding
threshold to the maximum a-posteriori threshold of the underlying uncoupled
ensembles occurs for large enough coupling memory. The improvement of the BP
threshold is especially significant for SCCs and BCCs, whose uncoupled
ensembles suffer from a poor BP threshold. For a wide range of code rates,
SC-TCs show close-to-capacity performance as the coupling memory increases. We
further give a proof of threshold saturation for SC-TC ensembles with identical
component encoders. In particular, we show that the DE of SC-TC ensembles with
identical component encoders can be properly rewritten as a scalar recursion.
This allows us to define potential functions and prove threshold saturation
using the proof technique recently introduced by Yedla et al..

 <dc:description>  We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map raw pixels from a
single front-facing camera directly to steering commands. This end-to-end
approach proved surprisingly powerful. With minimum training data from humans
the system learns to drive in traffic on local roads with or without lane
markings and on highways. It also operates in areas with unclear visual
guidance such as in parking lots and on unpaved roads.
  The system automatically learns internal representations of the necessary
processing steps such as detecting useful road features with only the human
steering angle as the training signal. We never explicitly trained it to
detect, for example, the outline of roads.
  Compared to explicit decomposition of the problem, such as lane marking
detection, path planning, and control, our end-to-end system optimizes all
processing steps simultaneously. We argue that this will eventually lead to
better performance and smaller systems. Better performance will result because
the internal components self-optimize to maximize overall system performance,
instead of optimizing human-selected intermediate criteria, e.g., lane
detection. Such criteria understandably are selected for ease of human
interpretation which doesn't automatically guarantee maximum system
performance. Smaller networks are possible because the system learns to solve
the problem with the minimal number of processing steps.
  We used an NVIDIA DevBox and Torch 7 for training and an NVIDIA DRIVE(TM) PX
self-driving car computer also running Torch 7 for determining where to drive.
The system operates at 30 frames per second (FPS).

 <dc:description>  In future Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the explosive growth of mobile
devices compel us to reconsider the effectiveness of the current
frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) schemes. Devices' differentiated
mobility features and diversified scattering environments make it more
complicated to characterize the multi-user interference. In this paper, we
thoroughly analyze the impacts of devices' mobility on the inter-sub-carrier
interference (ICI) in an IoT system based on the 3GPP narrow-band orthogonal
frequency-division multiple access (NB-OFDMA) protocol, and obtain the
relationship between the system sum-rate and devices' mobility. Our results may
shed some lights on the system design under the mobile scenarios.

 <dc:title>Semi-supervised Dictionary Learning Based on Hilbert-Schmidt

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel semi-supervised dictionary learning and sparse
representation (SS-DLSR) is proposed. The proposed method benefits from the
supervisory information by learning the dictionary in a space where the
dependency between the data and class labels is maximized. This maximization is
performed using Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). On the other
hand, the global distribution of the underlying manifolds were learned from the
unlabeled data by minimizing the distances between the unlabeled data and the
corresponding nearest labeled data in the space of the dictionary learned. The
proposed SS-DLSR algorithm has closed-form solutions for both the dictionary
and sparse coefficients, and therefore does not have to learn the two
iteratively and alternately as is common in the literature of the DLSR. This
makes the solution for the proposed algorithm very fast. The experiments
confirm the improvement in classification performance on benchmark datasets by
including the information from both labeled and unlabeled data, particularly
when there are many unlabeled data.

 <dc:description>  Among the various means to evaluate the quality of video streams,
No-Reference (NR) methods have low computation and may be executed on thin
clients. Thus, NR algorithms would be perfect candidates in cases of real-time
quality assessment, automated quality control and, particularly, in adaptive
mobile streaming. Yet, existing NR approaches are often inaccurate, in
comparison to Full-Reference (FR) algorithms, especially under lossy network
conditions. In this work, we present an NR method that combines machine
learning with simple NR metrics to achieve a quality index comparably as
accurate as the Video Quality Metric (VQM) Full-Reference algorithm. Our method
is tested in an extensive dataset (960 videos), under lossy network conditions
and considering nine different machine learning algorithms. Overall, we achieve
an over 97% correlation with VQM, while allowing real-time assessment of video
quality of experience in realistic streaming scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Computational modeling of visual saliency has become an important research
problem in recent years, with applications in video quality estimation, video
compression, object tracking, retargeting, summarization, and so on. While most
visual saliency models for dynamic scenes operate on raw video, several models
have been developed for use with compressed-domain information such as motion
vectors and transform coefficients. This paper presents a comparative study of
eleven such models as well as two high-performing pixel-domain saliency models
on two eye-tracking datasets using several comparison metrics. The results
indicate that highly accurate saliency estimation is possible based only on a
partially decoded video bitstream. The strategies that have shown success in
compressed-domain saliency modeling are highlighted, and certain challenges are
identified as potential avenues for further improvement.

 <dc:description>  We propose an incremental strategy for learning hash functions with kernels
for large-scale image search. Our method is based on a two-stage classification
framework that treats binary codes as intermediate variables between the
feature space and the semantic space. In the first stage of classification,
binary codes are considered as class labels by a set of binary SVMs; each
corresponds to one bit. In the second stage, binary codes become the input
space of a multi-class SVM. Hash functions are learned by an efficient
algorithm where the NP-hard problem of finding optimal binary codes is solved
via cyclic coordinate descent and SVMs are trained in a parallelized
incremental manner. For modifications like adding images from a previously
unseen class, we describe an incremental procedure for effective and efficient
updates to the previous hash functions. Experiments on three large-scale image
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hashing method,
Supervised Incremental Hashing (SIH), over the state-of-the-art supervised
hashing methods.

 <dc:description>  We propose a hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) technique applicable to
high-dimensional multivariate normal distributions that effectively samples
along chaotic trajectories. The method is predicated on the freedom of choice
of the HMC momentum distribution, and due to its mixing properties, exhibits
sample-to-sample autocorrelations that decay far faster than those in the
traditional hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We test the methods on distributions
of varying correlation structure, finding that the proposed technique produces
superior covariance estimates, is less reliant on step-size tuning, and can
even function with sparse or no momentum re-sampling. The method presented here
is promising for more general distributions, such as those that arise in
Bayesian learning of artificial neural networks and in the state and parameter
estimation of dynamical systems.

 <dc:description>  We present a new paradigm for speeding up randomized computations of several
frequently used functions in machine learning. In particular, our paradigm can
be applied for improving computations of kernels based on random embeddings.
Above that, the presented framework covers multivariate randomized functions.
As a byproduct, we propose an algorithmic approach that also leads to a
significant reduction of space complexity. Our method is based on careful
recycling of Gaussian vectors into structured matrices that share properties of
fully random matrices. The quality of the proposed structured approach follows
from combinatorial properties of the graphs encoding correlations between rows
of these structured matrices. Our framework covers as special cases already
known structured approaches such as the Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform,
but is much more general since it can be applied also to highly nonlinear
embeddings. We provide strong concentration results showing the quality of the
presented paradigm.

time $O(p(\delta+1)(n+m)\log(n))$ with radius not exceeding $r_p + \delta$ when
$p \leq 2$ and $r_p + 3\delta$ when $p \geq 3$, where $r_p$ are the optimal
radii. Prior work identified $p$-centers with accuracy $r_p+\delta$ but with
time complexity $O((n^3\log n + n^2m)\log(diam(G)))$ which is impractical for
large graphs.

 <dc:title>Attributes for Improved Attributes: A Multi-Task Network for Attribute
  Classification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hand, Emily M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Chellappa, Rama</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Attributes, or semantic features, have gained popularity in the past few
years in domains ranging from activity recognition in video to face
verification. Improving the accuracy of attribute classifiers is an important
first step in any application which uses these attributes. In most works to
date, attributes have been considered to be independent. However, we know this
not to be the case. Many attributes are very strongly related, such as heavy
makeup and wearing lipstick. We propose to take advantage of attribute
relationships in three ways: by using a multi-task deep convolutional neural
network (MCNN) sharing the lowest layers amongst all attributes, sharing the
higher layers for related attributes, and by building an auxiliary network on
top of the MCNN which utilizes the scores from all attributes to improve the
final classification of each attribute. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method by producing results on two challenging publicly available datasets.

 <dc:description>  A persistence lens is a hierarchy of disjoint upper and lower level sets of a
continuous luminance image's Reeb graph. The boundary components of a
persistence lens's interior components are Jordan curves that serve as a
hierarchical segmentation of the image, and may be rendered as vector graphics.
A persistence lens determines a varilet basis for the luminance image, in which
image simplification is a realized by subspace projection. Image scale space,
and image fractal analysis, result from applying a scale measure to each basis
function.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an efficient method for estimating the probability of
conflict between air traffic within a block of airspace. Autonomous
Sense-and-Avoid is an essential safety feature to enable Unmanned Air Systems
to operate alongside other (manned or unmanned) air traffic. The ability to
estimate probability of conflict between traffic is an essential part of
Sense-and-Avoid. Such probabilities are typically very low. Evaluating low
probabilities using naive Direct Monte Carlo generates a significant
computational load. This paper applies a technique called Subset Simulation.
The small failure probabilities are computed as a product of larger conditional
failure probabilities, reducing the computational load whilst improving the
accuracy of the probability estimates. The reduction in the number of samples
required can be one or more orders of magnitude. The utility of the approach is
demonstrated by modeling a series of conflicting and potentially conflicting
scenarios based on the standard Rules of the Air.

 <dc:description>  Optical computing has emerged as a promising candidate for real-time and
parallel continuous data processing. Motivated by recent progresses in
metamaterial-based analog computing [Science 343, 160 (2014)], we theoretically
investigate realization of two-dimensional complex mathematical operations
using rotated configurations, recently reported in [Opt. Lett. 39, 1278
(2014)]. Breaking the reflection symmetry, such configurations could realize
both even and odd Green's functions associated with spatial operators. Based on
such appealing theory and by using Brewster effect, we demonstrate realization
of a first-order differentiator. Such efficient wave-based computation method
not only circumvents the major potential drawbacks of metamaterials, but also
offers the most compact possible device compared to the conventional bulky
lens-based optical signal and data processors.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we present a novel approach for parsing argumentation
structures. We identify argument components using sequence labeling at the
token level and apply a new joint model for detecting argumentation structures.
The proposed model globally optimizes argument component types and
argumentative relations using integer linear programming. We show that our
model considerably improves the performance of base classifiers and
significantly outperforms challenging heuristic baselines. Moreover, we
introduce a novel corpus of persuasive essays annotated with argumentation
structures. We show that our annotation scheme and annotation guidelines
successfully guide human annotators to substantial agreement. This corpus and
the annotation guidelines are freely available for ensuring reproducibility and
to encourage future research in computational argumentation.

 <dc:description>  We present a scheduler that improves cluster utilization and job completion
times by packing tasks having multi-resource requirements and
inter-dependencies. While the problem is algorithmically very hard, we achieve
near-optimality on the job DAGs that appear in production clusters at a large
enterprise and in benchmarks such as TPC-DS. A key insight is that carefully
handling the long-running tasks and those with tough-to-pack resource needs
will produce good-enough schedules. However, which subset of tasks to treat
carefully is not clear (and intractable to discover). Hence, we offer a search
procedure that evaluates various possibilities and outputs a preferred schedule
order over tasks. An online component enforces the schedule orders desired by
the various jobs running on the cluster. In addition, it packs tasks, overbooks
the fungible resources and guarantees bounded unfairness for a variety of
desirable fairness schemes. Relative to the state-of-the art schedulers, we
speed up 50% of the jobs by over 30% each.

 <dc:title>Towards Real-time Simulation of Hyperelastic Materials</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Tiantian</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a new method for real-time physics-based simulation supporting
many different types of hyperelastic materials. Previous methods such as
Position Based or Projective Dynamics are fast, but support only limited
selection of materials; even classical materials such as the Neo-Hookean
elasticity are not supported. Recently, Xu et al. [2015] introduced new
&quot;spline-based materials&quot; which can be easily controlled by artists to achieve
desired animation effects. Simulation of these types of materials currently
relies on Newton's method, which is slow, even with only one iteration per
timestep. In this paper, we show that Projective Dynamics can be interpreted as
a quasi-Newton method. This insight enables very efficient simulation of a
large class of hyperelastic materials, including the Neo-Hookean, spline-based
materials, and others. The quasi-Newton interpretation also allows us to
leverage ideas from numerical optimization. In particular, we show that our
solver can be further accelerated using L-BFGS updates (Limited-memory
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm). Our final method is typically more
than 10 times faster than one iteration of Newton's method without compromising
quality. In fact, our result is often more accurate than the result obtained
with one iteration of Newton's method. Our method is also easier to implement,
implying reduced software development costs.

 <dc:description>  We present an unsupervised visual feature learning algorithm driven by
context-based pixel prediction. By analogy with auto-encoders, we propose
Context Encoders -- a convolutional neural network trained to generate the
contents of an arbitrary image region conditioned on its surroundings. In order
to succeed at this task, context encoders need to both understand the content
of the entire image, as well as produce a plausible hypothesis for the missing
part(s). When training context encoders, we have experimented with both a
standard pixel-wise reconstruction loss, as well as a reconstruction plus an
adversarial loss. The latter produces much sharper results because it can
better handle multiple modes in the output. We found that a context encoder
learns a representation that captures not just appearance but also the
semantics of visual structures. We quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness
of our learned features for CNN pre-training on classification, detection, and
segmentation tasks. Furthermore, context encoders can be used for semantic
inpainting tasks, either stand-alone or as initialization for non-parametric
methods.

 <dc:description>  We consider a secure communication scenario through the two-user Gaussian
interference channel: each transmitter (user) has a confidential message to
send reliably to its intended receiver while keeping it secret from the other
receiver. Prior work investigated the performance of two different approaches
for this scenario; i.i.d. Gaussian random codes and real alignment of
structured codes. While the latter achieves the optimal sum secure degrees of
freedom (s.d.o.f.), its extension to finite SNR regimes is challenging. In this
paper, we propose a new achievability scheme for the weak and the moderately
weak interference regimes, in which the reliability as well as the
confidentiality of the transmitted messages are maintained at any finite SNR
value. Our scheme uses lattice structure, structured jamming codewords, and
lattice alignment in the encoding and the asymmetric compute-and-forward
strategy in the decoding. We show that our lower bound on the sum secure rates
scales linearly with log(SNR) and hence, it outperforms i.i.d. Gaussian random
codes. Furthermore, we show that our achievable result is asymptotically
optimal. Finally, we provide a discussion on an extension of our scheme to K&gt;2
users.

Data Science, offered at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The
course introduced general programming concepts by using the Python programming
language with an emphasis on data preparation, processing, and presentation.
The course had no prerequisites, and students were not expected to have any
programming experience. This introductory course was designed to cover a wide
range of topics, from the nature of data, to storage, to visualization, to
probability and statistical analysis, to cloud and high performance computing,
without becoming overly focused on any one subject. We conclude this article
with a discussion of lessons learned and our plans to develop new data science

 <dc:description>  Group discussions are essential for organizing every aspect of modern life,
from faculty meetings to senate debates, from grant review panels to papal
conclaves. While costly in terms of time and organization effort, group
discussions are commonly seen as a way of reaching better decisions compared to
solutions that do not require coordination between the individuals (e.g.
voting)---through discussion, the sum becomes greater than the parts. However,
this assumption is not irrefutable: anecdotal evidence of wasteful discussions
abounds, and in our own experiments we find that over 30% of discussions are
unproductive.
  We propose a framework for analyzing conversational dynamics in order to
determine whether a given task-oriented discussion is worth having or not. We
exploit conversational patterns reflecting the flow of ideas and the balance
between the participants, as well as their linguistic choices. We apply this
framework to conversations naturally occurring in an online collaborative world
exploration game developed and deployed to support this research. Using this
setting, we show that linguistic cues and conversational patterns extracted
from the first 20 seconds of a team discussion are predictive of whether it
will be a wasteful or a productive one.

 <dc:description>  One of the notable fields in studying the genetics of cancer is disease gene
identification which affects disease treatment and drug discovery. Many
researches have been done in this field. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
are one of them that focus on the identification of diseases-susceptible loci
on chromosomes. Recently, computational approaches, known as gene
prioritization methods have been used to identify candidate disease genes. Gene
prioritization methods integrate several data sources to discover and
prioritize the most probable candidate disease genes. In this paper, we propose
a prioritization method, called HybridRanker which is a network-based technique
and it also uses experimental data to identify candidate cancer genes. We apply
our proposed method on colorectal cancer data. It is notable to say that in
HybridRanker, for considering both local and global network information of a
protein-protein interaction network, different algorithms such as
shortest-path, random walk with restart and network propagation are exploited.
By using these algorithms, initial scores are given to genes within the
network. Furthermore, by looking through diseases with similar symptoms and
also comorbid diseases and by extracting their causing genes, the gene scores
are recalculated. We also use gene-phenotype relations for an additional
scoring of the candidate genes. Our method is validated and compared with other
prioritization methods in leave one-out cross-validation and the comparison
results show the better performance of the HybridRanker.

 <dc:description>  The identification of disease-associated genes has recently gathered much
attention for uncovering disease complex mechanisms that could lead to new
insights into the treatment of diseases. For exploring disease-susceptible
genes, not only experimental approaches such as genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have been used, but also computational methods. Since experimental
approaches are both time-consuming and expensive, numerous studies have
utilized computational techniques to explore disease genes. These methods use
various biological data sources and known disease genes to prioritize disease
candidate genes. In this paper, we propose a gene prioritization method
(NRSSPrioritize), which benefits from both local and global measures of a
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and also from disease similarity
knowledge to suggest candidate genes for colorectal cancer (CRC)
susceptibility. Network Propagation, Random Walk with Restart, and Shortest
Paths are three network analysis tools that are applied to a PPI network for
the purpose of scoring candidate genes. Also, by looking through diseases with
similar symptoms to CRC and obtaining their causing genes, candidate genes are
scored in a different way. Finally, to integrate these four different scoring
schemes, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution
(TOPSIS) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) methods are applied to obtain
appropriate weights for the above four quantified measures and the weighted
summation of these measures are used to calculate the final score of each
candidate gene. NRSSPrioritize was validated by cross-validation analysis and
its results were compared with other prioritization tools, which gave the best
performance when using our proposed method.

 <dc:description>  We describe a sketch interpretation system that detects and classifies clock
numerals created by subjects taking the Clock Drawing Test, a clinical tool
widely used to screen for cognitive impairments (e.g., dementia). We describe
how it balances appearance and context, and document its performance on some
2,000 drawings (about 24K clock numerals) produced by a wide spectrum of
patients. We calibrate the utility of different forms of context, describing
experiments with Conditional Random Fields trained and tested using a variety
of features. We identify context that contributes to interpreting otherwise
ambiguous or incomprehensible strokes. We describe ST-slices, a novel
representation that enables &quot;unpeeling&quot; the layers of ink that result when
people overwrite, which often produces ink impossible to analyze if only the
final drawing is examined. We characterize when ST-slices work, calibrate their
impact on performance, and consider their breadth of applicability.

 <dc:description>  The sensitivity of a Boolean function f is the maximum over all inputs x, of
the number of sensitive coordinates of x. The well-known sensitivity conjecture
of Nisan (see also Nisan and Szegedy) states that every sensitivity-s Boolean
function can be computed by a polynomial over the reals of degree poly(s). The
best known upper bounds on degree, however, are exponential rather than
polynomial in s.
  Our main result is an approximate version of the conjecture: every Boolean
function with sensitivity s can be epsilon-approximated (in L_2) by a
polynomial whose degree is O(s log(1/epsilon)). This is the first improvement
on the folklore bound of s/epsilon. Further, we show that improving the bound
to O(s^c log(1/epsilon)^d)$ for any d &lt; 1 and any c &gt; 0 will imply the
sensitivity conjecture. Thus our result is essentially the best one can hope
for without proving the conjecture.
  We postulate a robust analogue of the sensitivity conjecture: if most inputs
to a Boolean function f have low sensitivity, then most of the Fourier mass of
f is concentrated on small subsets, and present an approach towards proving
this conjecture.

 <dc:description>  Self-driving vehicles are a maturing technology with the potential to reshape
mobility by enhancing the safety, accessibility, efficiency, and convenience of
automotive transportation. Safety-critical tasks that must be executed by a
self-driving vehicle include planning of motions through a dynamic environment
shared with other vehicles and pedestrians, and their robust executions via
feedback control. The objective of this paper is to survey the current state of
the art on planning and control algorithms with particular regard to the urban
setting. A selection of proposed techniques is reviewed along with a discussion
of their effectiveness. The surveyed approaches differ in the vehicle mobility
model used, in assumptions on the structure of the environment, and in
computational requirements. The side-by-side comparison presented in this
survey helps to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of the reviewed
approaches and assists with system level design choices.

 <dc:description>  It is commonly believed that the central visual field is important for
recognizing objects and faces, and the peripheral region is useful for scene
recognition. However, the relative importance of central versus peripheral
information for object, scene, and face recognition is unclear. In a behavioral
study, Larson and Loschky (2009) investigated this question by measuring the
scene recognition accuracy as a function of visual angle, and demonstrated that
peripheral vision was indeed more useful in recognizing scenes than central
vision. In this work, we modeled and replicated the result of Larson and
Loschky (2009), using deep convolutional neural networks. Having fit the data
for scenes, we used the model to predict future data for large-scale scene
recognition as well as for objects and faces. Our results suggest that the
relative order of importance of using central visual field information is face
recognition&gt;object recognition&gt;scene recognition, and vice-versa for peripheral
information.

 <dc:title>Estimating Weighted Matchings in $o(n)$ Space</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of estimating the weight of a maximum weighted
matching of a weighted graph $G(V,E)$ whose edges are revealed in a streaming
fashion. We develop a reduction from the maximum weighted matching problem to
the maximum cardinality matching problem that only doubles the approximation
factor of a streaming algorithm developed for the maximum cardinality matching
problem. Our results hold for the insertion-only and the dynamic (i.e,
insertion and deletion) edge-arrival streaming models. The previous best-known
reduction is due to Bury and Schwiegelshohn (ESA 2015) who develop an algorithm
whose approximation guarantee scales by a polynomial factor.
  As an application, we obtain improved estimators for weighted planar graphs
and, more generally, for weighted bounded-arboricity graphs, by feeding into
our reduction the recent estimators due to Esfandiari et al. (SODA 2015) and to
Chitnis et al. (SODA 2016). In particular, we obtain a
$(48+\epsilon)$-approximation estimator for the weight of a maximum weighted
matching in planar graphs.

 <dc:description>  Multi-person tracking plays a critical role in the analysis of surveillance
video. However, most existing work focus on shorter-term (e.g. minute-long or
hour-long) video sequences. Therefore, we propose a multi-person tracking
algorithm for very long-term (e.g. month-long) multi-camera surveillance
scenarios. Long-term tracking is challenging because 1) the apparel/appearance
of the same person will vary greatly over multiple days and 2) a person will
leave and re-enter the scene numerous times. To tackle these challenges, we
leverage face recognition information, which is robust to apparel change, to
automatically reinitialize our tracker over multiple days of recordings.
Unfortunately, recognized faces are unavailable oftentimes. Therefore, our
tracker propagates identity information to frames without recognized faces by
uncovering the appearance and spatial manifold formed by person detections. We
tested our algorithm on a 23-day 15-camera data set (4,935 hours total), and we
were able to localize a person 53.2% of the time with 69.8% precision. We
further performed video summarization experiments based on our tracking output.
Results on 116.25 hours of video showed that we were able to generate a
reasonable visual diary (i.e. a summary of what a person did) for different
people, thus potentially opening the door to automatic summarization of the
vast amount of surveillance video generated every day.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new state space generation approach for dynamic fault
trees (DFTs) together with a technique to synthesise failures rates in DFTs.
Our state space generation technique aggressively exploits the DFT structure
--- detecting symmetries, spurious non-determinism, and don't cares. Benchmarks
show a gain of more than two orders of magnitude in terms of state space
generation and analysis time. Our approach supports DFTs with symbolic failure
rates and is complemented by parameter synthesis. This enables determining the
maximal tolerable failure rate of a system component while ensuring that the
mean time of failure stays below a threshold.

 <dc:title>Optimal Compression of a Polyline with Segments and Arcs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes an efficient approach to constructing a resultant
polyline with a minimum number of segments and arcs. While fitting an arc can
be done with complexity O(1) (see [1] and [2]), the main complexity is in
checking that the resultant arc is within the specified tolerance. There are
additional tests to check for the ends and for changes in direction (see [3,
section 3] and [4, sections II.C and II.D]). However, the most important part
in reducing complexity is the ability to subdivide the polyline in order to
limit the number of arc fittings [2]. The approach described in this paper
finds a compressed polyline with a minimum number of segments and arcs.

 <dc:description>  Given a network of fixed size $n$ and an initial distribution of data, we
derive sufficient connectivity conditions on a sequence of time-varying
digraphs for (a) data collection and (b) data dissemination, within at most
$(n-1)$ iterations. The former is shown to enable distributed computation of
the network size $n$, while the latter does not. Knowledge of $n$ subsequently
enables each node to acknowledge the earliest time point at which they can
cease communication, specifically we find the number of redundant signals can
be truncated at the finite time $n$. Using a probabilistic approach, we obtain
tight upper and lower bounds for the expected time until the $\textit{last}$
node obtains the entire collection of data, in other words complete data
dissemination. Similarly tight upper and lower bounds are also found for the
expected time until the $\textit{first}$ node obtains the entire collection of
data. Interestingly, these bounds are both $\Theta (\text{log}_2(n))$ and in
fact differ by only two iterations. Numerical results are explored and verify
each result.

 <dc:description>  Multi-scale deep CNNs have been used successfully for problems mapping each
pixel to a label, such as depth estimation and semantic segmentation. It has
also been shown that such architectures are reusable and can be used for
multiple tasks. These networks are typically trained independently for each
task by varying the output layer(s) and training objective. In this work we
present a new model for simultaneous depth estimation and semantic segmentation
from a single RGB image. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of training
parts of the model for each task and then fine tuning the full, combined model
on both tasks simultaneously using a single loss function. Furthermore we
couple the deep CNN with fully connected CRF, which captures the contextual
relationships and interactions between the semantic and depth cues improving
the accuracy of the final results. The proposed model is trained and evaluated
on NYUDepth V2 dataset outperforming the state of the art methods on semantic
segmentation and achieving comparable results on the task of depth estimation.

 <dc:description>  We develop a novel multi-fidelity framework that goes far beyond the
classical AR(1) Co-kriging scheme of Kennedy and O'Hagan (2000). Our method can
handle general discontinuous cross-correlations among systems with different
levels of fidelity. A combination of multi-fidelity Gaussian Processes (AR(1)
Co-kriging) and deep neural networks enables us to construct a method that is
immune to discontinuities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new
technology using standard benchmark problems designed to resemble the outputs
of complicated high- and low-fidelity codes.

 <dc:description>  The human behavior of evaluating other individuals with respect to their
personality traits and intelligence by evaluating their faces plays a crucial
role in human relations. These trait judgments might influence important social
outcomes in our lives such as elections and court sentences. Previous studies
have reported that human can make valid inferences for at least four
personality traits. In addition, some studies have demonstrated that facial
trait evaluation can be learned using machine learning methods accurately. In
this work, we experimentally explore whether self-reported personality traits
and intelligence can be predicted reliably from a facial image. More
specifically, the prediction problem is separately cast in two parts: a
classification task and a regression task. A facial structural feature is
constructed from the relations among facial salient points, and an appearance
feature is built by five texture descriptors. In addition, a minutia-based
fingerprint feature from a fingerprint image is also explored. The
classification results show that the personality traits &quot;Rule-consciousness&quot;
and &quot;Vigilance&quot; can be predicted reliably, and that the traits of females can
be predicted more accurately than those of male. However, the regression
experiments show that it is difficult to predict scores for individual
personality traits and intelligence. The residual plots and the correlation
results indicate no evident linear correlation between the measured scores and
the predicted scores. Both the classification and the regression results reveal
that &quot;Rule-consciousness&quot; and &quot;Tension&quot; can be reliably predicted from the
facial features, while &quot;Social boldness&quot; gets the worst prediction results. The
experiments results show that it is difficult to predict intelligence from
either the facial features or the fingerprint feature, a finding that is in
agreement with previous studies.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent researches show that millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can offer
orders of magnitude increases in the cellular capacity. However, the secrecy
performance of a mmWave cellular network has not been investigated so far.
Leveraging the new path-loss and blockage models for mmWave channels, which are
significantly different from the conventional microwave channel, this paper
comprehensively studies the network-wide physical layer security performance of
the downlink transmission in a mmWave cellular network under a stochastic
geometry framework. We first study the secure connectivity probability and the
average number of perfect communication links per unit area in a noise-limited
mmWave network for both non-colluding and colluding eavesdroppers scenarios,
respectively. Then, we evaluate the effect of the artificial noise (AN) on the
secrecy performance, and derive the analysis result of average number of
perfect communication links per unit area in an interference-limited mmWave
network. Numerical results are demonstrated to show the network-wide secrecy
performance, and provide interesting insights into how the secrecy performance
is influenced by various network parameters: antenna array pattern, base
station (BS) intensity, and AN power allocation, etc.

 <dc:title>Once for All: a Two-flow Convolutional Neural Network for Visual
  Tracking</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Kai</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tao, Wenbing</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the main challenges of visual object tracking comes from the arbitrary
appearance of objects. Most existing algorithms try to resolve this problem as
an object-specific task, i.e., the model is trained to regenerate or classify a
specific object. As a result, the model need to be initialized and retrained
for different objects. In this paper, we propose a more generic approach
utilizing a novel two-flow convolutional neural network (named YCNN). The YCNN
takes two inputs (one is object image patch, the other is search image patch),
then outputs a response map which predicts how likely the object appears in a
specific location. Unlike those object-specific approach, the YCNN is trained
to measure the similarity between two image patches. Thus it will not be
confined to any specific object. Furthermore the network can be end-to-end
trained to extract both shallow and deep convolutional features which are
dedicated for visual tracking. And once properly trained, the YCNN can be
applied to track all kinds of objects without further training and updating.
Benefiting from the once-for-all model, our algorithm is able to run at a very
high speed of 45 frames-per-second. The experiments on 51 sequences also show
that our algorithm achieves an outstanding performance.

 <dc:description>  In this paper the major objective is to design and analyze the suitability of
Gaussian similarity measure for intrusion detection. The objective is to use
this as a distance measure to find the distance between any two data samples of
training set such as DARPA Data Set, KDD Data Set. This major objective is to
use this measure as a distance metric when applying k- means algorithm. The
novelty of this approach is making use of the proposed distance function as
part of k-means algorithm so as to obtain disjoint clusters. This is followed
by a case study, which demonstrates the process of Intrusion Detection. The
proposed similarity has fixed upper and lower bounds. The proposed similarity
measure satisfies all properties of a typical similarity measure.

 <dc:description>  Change detection is the study of detecting changes between two different
images of a scene taken at different times. By the detected change areas,
however, a human cannot understand how different the two images. Therefore, a
semantic understanding is required in the change detection research such as
disaster investigation. The paper proposes the concept of semantic change
detection, which involves intuitively inserting semantic meaning into detected
change areas. We mainly focus on the novel semantic segmentation in addition to
a conventional change detection approach. In order to solve this problem and
obtain a high-level of performance, we propose an improvement to the
hypercolumns representation, hereafter known as hypermaps, which effectively
uses convolutional maps obtained from convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We
also employ multi-scale feature representation captured by different image
patches. We applied our method to the TSUNAMI Panoramic Change Detection
dataset, and re-annotated the changed areas of the dataset via semantic
classes. The results show that our multi-scale hypermaps provided outstanding
performance on the re-annotated TSUNAMI dataset.

 <dc:description>  Graph clustering has many important applications in computing, but due to
growing sizes of graphs, even traditionally fast clustering methods such as
spectral partitioning can be computationally expensive for real-world graphs of
interest. Motivated partly by this, so-called local algorithms for graph
clustering have received significant interest due to the fact that they can
find good clusters in a graph with work proportional to the size of the cluster
rather than that of the entire graph. This feature has proven to be crucial in
making such graph clustering and many of its downstream applications efficient
in practice. While local clustering algorithms are already faster than
traditional algorithms that touch the entire graph, they are sequential and
there is an opportunity to make them even more efficient via parallelization.
In this paper, we show how to parallelize many of these algorithms in the
shared-memory multicore setting, and we analyze the parallel complexity of
these algorithms. We present comprehensive experiments on large-scale graphs
showing that our parallel algorithms achieve good parallel speedups on a modern
multicore machine, thus significantly speeding up the analysis of local graph
clusters in the very large-scale setting.

 <dc:description>  The tremendous growth in 3D (stereo) imaging and display technologies has led
to stereoscopic content (video and image) becoming increasingly popular.
However, both the subjective and the objective evaluation of stereoscopic video
content has not kept pace with the rapid growth of the content. Further, the
availability of standard stereoscopic video databases is also quite limited. In
this work, we attempt to alleviate these shortcomings. We present a
stereoscopic video database and its subjective evaluation. We have created a
database containing a set of 144 distorted videos. We limit our attention to
H.264 compression artifacts. The distorted videos were generated using 6
uncompressed pristine videos of left and right views originally created by
Goldmann et al. at EPFL [1]. Further, 19 subjects participated in the
subjective assessment task. Based on the subjective study, we have formulated a
relation between the 2D and stereoscopic subjective scores as a function of
compression rate and depth range. We have also evaluated the performance of
popular 2D and 3D image/video quality assessment (I/VQA) algorithms on our
database.

 <dc:description>  Recommender systems usually face the problem of serving the same
recommendations across multiple sessions regardless of whether the user is
interested in them or not, thereby reducing their effectiveness. To add
freshness to the recommended products, we introduce a feedback loop where the
set of recommended products in the current session depend on the user's
interaction with the previously recommended sets. We also describe ways of
addressing freshness when there is little or even no direct user interaction.
We define a metric to quantify freshness by reducing the problem to measuring
temporal diversity.

 <dc:description>  Mobile-edge computing (MEC) emerges as a promising paradigm to improve the
quality of computation experience for mobile devices. Nevertheless, the design
of computation task scheduling policies for MEC systems inevitably encounters a
challenging two-timescale stochastic optimization problem. Specifically, in the
larger timescale, whether to execute a task locally at the mobile device or to
offload a task to the MEC server for cloud computing should be decided, while
in the smaller timescale, the transmission policy for the task input data
should adapt to the channel side information. In this paper, we adopt a Markov
decision process approach to handle this problem, where the computation tasks
are scheduled based on the queueing state of the task buffer, the execution
state of the local processing unit, as well as the state of the transmission
unit. By analyzing the average delay of each task and the average power
consumption at the mobile device, we formulate a power-constrained delay
minimization problem, and propose an efficient one-dimensional search algorithm
to find the optimal task scheduling policy. Simulation results are provided to
demonstrate the capability of the proposed optimal stochastic task scheduling
policy in achieving a shorter average execution delay compared to the baseline
policies.

that have multiple datasets but none of them are large enough to provide
abundant data variations. In this work, we present a pipeline for learning deep

neurons learn representations shared across several domains, while some others
are effective only for a specific one. Based on this important observation, we
propose a Domain Guided Dropout algorithm to improve the feature learning
procedure. Experiments show the effectiveness of our pipeline and the proposed
algorithm. Our methods on the person re-identification problem outperform
state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets by large margins.

 <dc:description>  Whether the online social media, like Twitter or its variant Weibo, can be a
convincing proxy to predict the stock market has been debated for years,
especially for China. However, as the traditional theory in behavioral finance
states, the individual emotions can influence decision-making of investors, so
it is reasonable to further explore this controversial topic from the
perspective of online emotions, which is richly carried by massive tweets in
social media. Surprisingly, through thorough study on over 10 million
stock-relevant tweets from Weibo, both correlation analysis and causality test
show that five attributes of the stock market in China can be competently
predicted by various online emotions, like disgust, joy, sadness and fear.
Specifically, the presented model significantly outperforms the baseline
solutions on predicting five attributes of the stock market under the $K$-means
discretization. We also employ this model in the scenario of realistic online
application and its performance is further testified.

 <dc:description>  Earlier we presented a method to decompose modal formulas for processes with
the internal action $\tau$, and congruence formats for branching and
$\eta$-bisimilarity were derived on the basis of this decomposition method. The
idea is that a congruence format for a semantics must ensure that the formulas
in the modal characterisation of this semantics are always decomposed into
formulas that are again in this modal characterisation. In this follow-up paper
the decomposition method is enhanced to deal with modal characterisations that
contain a modality $\langle\epsilon\rangle\langle a\rangle\phi$, to derive
congruence formats for delay and weak bisimilarity.

 <dc:description>  A sleeping beauty in diffusion indicates that the information, can be ideas
or innovations, will experience a hibernation before a sudden spike of
popularity and it is widely found in citation history of scientific
publications. However, in this study, we demonstrate that the sleeping beauty
is an interesting and unexceptional phenomenon in information diffusion and
even more inspiring, there exist two consecutive sleeping beauties in the
entire lifetime of propagation, suggesting that the information, including
scientific topics, search queries or Wikipedia entries, which we call memes,
will go unnoticed for a period and suddenly attracts some attention, and then
it falls asleep again and later wakes up with another unexpected popularity
peak. Further explorations on this phenomenon show that intervals between two
wake ups follow an exponential distribution and the second wake up generally
reaches its peak at a higher velocity. In addition, higher volume of the first
wake up will lead to even much higher popularity of the second wake up with
great odds. Taking these findings into consideration, an upgraded Bass model is
presented to well describe the diffusion dynamics of memes on different media.
Our results can help understand the common mechanism behind propagation of
different memes and are instructive to locate the tipping point in marketing or
find innovative publications in science.

 <dc:description>  We present two improved algorithms for weighted discrete $p$-center problem
for tree networks with $n$ vertices. One of our proposed algorithms runs in
$O(n \log n + p \log^2 n \log(n/p))$ time. For all values of $p$, our algorithm
thus runs as fast as or faster than the most efficient $O(n\log^2 n)$ time
algorithm obtained by applying Cole's speed-up technique [cole1987] to the
algorithm due to Megiddo and Tamir [megiddo1983], which has remained
unchallenged for nearly 30 years. Our other algorithm, which is more practical,
runs in $O(n \log n + p^2 \log^2(n/p))$ time, and when $p=O(\sqrt{n})$ it is
faster than Megiddo and Tamir's $O(n \log^2n \log\log n)$ time algorithm
[megiddo1983].

 <dc:description>  This Study proposes a routing strategy of combining a packet scheduling with
congestion control policy that applied for LEO satellite network with high
speed and multiple traffic. It not only ensures the QoS of different traffic,
but also can avoid low priority traffic to be &quot;starve&quot; due to their weak
resource competitiveness, thus it guarantees the throughput and performance of
the network. In the end, we set up a LEO satellite network simulation platform
in OPNET to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  A fundamental resource allocation setting is the random assignment problem in
which agents express preferences over objects that are then randomly allocated
to the agents. In 2001, Bogomolnaia and Moulin presented the probabilistic
serial (PS) mechanism that is an anonymous, neutral, Pareto optimal, and weak
strategyproof mechanism when the preferences are considered with respect to
stochastic dominance. The result holds when agents have strict preferences over
individual objects. It has been an open problem whether there exists a
mechanism that satisfies the same properties when agents may have indifference
among the objects. We show that for this more general domain, there exists no
extension of PS that is ex post efficient and weak strategyproof. The result is
surprising because it does not even require additional symmetry or fairness
conditions such as anonymity, neutrality, or equal treatment of equals. Our
result further demonstrates that the lack of weak SD-strategyproofness of the
extended PS mechanism of Katta and Sethuraman (2006) is not a design flaw of
extended PS but is due to an inherent incompatibility of efficiency and
strategyproofness of PS in the full preference domain.

 <dc:description>  Disk encryption is frequently used to secure confidential data on mobile
devices. However, the high energy cost of disk encryption poses a heavy burden
on those devices with limited battery capacity especially when a large amount
of data needs to be protected by disk encryption. To address the challenge, we
develop a new kernel-level disk encryption software, Populus. Almost 98% of
Populus's encryption/decryption computation is not related with the input
plaintext/ciphertext, so we accomplish the computation in advance during
initialization when a consistent power supply is available. We conduct
cryptanalysis on Populus and finally conclude that state-of-the-art
cryptanalysis techniques fail to break Populus in reasonable computational
complexity. We also conduct energy consumption experiments on Populus and
dm-crypt, a famous disk encryption software for Android and Linux mobile
devices. The experimental results demonstrate that Populus consumes 50%-70%
less energy than dm-crypt.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a hybrid route-path planning model for an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle's task assignment and management while the AUV is operating
through the variable littoral waters. Several prioritized tasks distributed in
a large scale terrain is defined first; then, considering the limitations over
the mission time, vehicle's battery, uncertainty and variability of the
underlying operating field, appropriate mission timing and energy management is
undertaken. The proposed objective is fulfilled by incorporating a
route-planner that is in charge of prioritizing the list of available tasks
according to available battery and a path-planer that acts in a smaller scale
to provide vehicle's safe deployment against environmental sudden changes. The
synchronous process of the task assign-route and path planning is simulated
using a specific composition of Differential Evolution and Firefly Optimization
(DEFO) Algorithms. The simulation results indicate that the proposed hybrid
model offers efficient performance in terms of completion of maximum number of
assigned tasks while perfectly expending the minimum energy, provided by using
the favorable current flow, and controlling the associated mission time. The
Monte-Carlo test is also performed for further analysis. The corresponding
results show the significant robustness of the model against uncertainties of
the operating field and variations of mission conditions.

 <dc:description>  Can we predict the winner of Miss Universe after watching how they stride
down the catwalk during the evening gown competition? Fashion gurus say they
can! In our work, we study this question from the perspective of computer
vision. In particular, we want to understand whether existing computer vision
approaches can be used to automatically extract the qualities exhibited by the
Miss Universe winners during their catwalk. This study can pave the way towards
new vision-based applications for the fashion industry. To this end, we propose
a novel video dataset, called the Miss Universe dataset, comprising 10 years of
the evening gown competition selected between 1996-2010. We further propose two
ranking-related problems: (1) Miss Universe Listwise Ranking and (2) Miss
Universe Pairwise Ranking. In addition, we also develop an approach that
simultaneously addresses the two proposed problems. To describe the videos we
employ the recently proposed Stacked Fisher Vectors in conjunction with robust
local spatio-temporal features. From our evaluation we found that although the
addressed problems are extremely challenging, the proposed system is able to
rank the winner in the top 3 best predicted scores for 5 out of 10 Miss
Universe competitions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of resilient state estimation in the presence of
integrity attacks. There are m sensors monitoring the state and p of them are
under attack. The sensory data collected by the compromised sensors can be
manipulated arbitrarily by the attacker. The classical estimators such as the
least squares estimator may not provide a reliable estimate under the so-called
(p,m)-sparse attack. In this work, we are not restricting our efforts in
studying whether any specific estimator is resilient to the attack or not, but
instead we aim to present the generic sufficient and necessary conditions for
resilience by considering a general class of convex optimization based
estimators. The sufficient and necessary conditions are shown to be tight, with
a trivial gap. We further specialize our result to scalar sensor measurements
case and present some conservative but verifiable results for practical use.
Experimental simulations tested on the IEEE 14-bus test system validate the
theoretical analysis.

 <dc:description>  Rummikub is a tile-based game in which each player starts with a hand of $14$
tiles. A tile has a value and a suit. The players form sets consisting of tiles
with the same suit and consecutive values (runs) or tiles with the same value
and different suits (groups). The corresponding optimization problem is, given
a hand of tiles, to form valid sets such that the score (sum of tile values) is
maximized. We first present an algorithm that solves this problem in polynomial
time. Next, we analyze the impact on the computational complexity when we
generalize over various input parameters. Finally, we attempt to better
understand some aspects involved in human play by means of an experiment that
considers counting problems related to the number of possible immediately
winning hands.

 <dc:description>  Classification Ensemble, which uses the weighed polling of outputs, is the
art of combining a set of basic classifiers for generating high-performance,
robust and more stable results. This study aims to improve the results of
identifying the Persian handwritten letters using Error Correcting Output
Coding (ECOC) ensemble method. Furthermore, the feature selection is used to
reduce the costs of errors in our proposed method. ECOC is a method for
decomposing a multi-way classification problem into many binary classification
tasks; and then combining the results of the subtasks into a hypothesized
solution to the original problem. Firstly, the image features are extracted by
Principal Components Analysis (PCA). After that, ECOC is used for
identification the Persian handwritten letters which it uses Support Vector
Machine (SVM) as the base classifier. The empirical results of applying this
ensemble method using 10 real-world data sets of Persian handwritten letters
indicate that this method has better results in identifying the Persian
handwritten letters than other ensemble methods and also single
classifications. Moreover, by testing a number of different features, this
paper found that we can reduce the additional cost in feature selection stage
by using this method.

 <dc:description>  In this paper q-ary Raptor codes under ML decoding are considered. An upper
bound on the probability of decoding failure is derived using the weight
enumerator of the outer code, or its expected weight enumerator if the outer
code is drawn randomly from some ensemble of codes. The bound is shown to be
tight by means of simulations. This bound provides a new insight into Raptor
codes since it shows how Raptor codes can be analyzed similarly to a classical
fixed-rate serial concatenation.

 <dc:description>  While full-duplex (FD) transmission has the potential to double the system
capacity, its substantial benefit can be offset by the self-interference (SI)
and non-ideality of practical transceivers. In this paper, we investigate the
achievable sum rates (ASRs) of half-duplex (HD) and FD transmissions with
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), where the non-ideality is
taken into consideration. Four transmission strategies are considered, namely
HD with uniform power allocation (UPA), HD with non-UPA (NUPA), FD with UPA,
and FD with NUPA. For each of the four transmission strategies, an optimization
problem is formulated to maximize its ASR, and a (suboptimal/optimal) solution
with low complexity is accordingly derived. Performance evaluations and
comparisons are conducted for three typical channels, namely symmetric
frequency-flat/selective and asymmetric frequency-selective channels. Results
show that the proposed solutions for both HD and FD transmissions can achieve
near optimal performances. For FD transmissions, the optimal solution can be
obtained under typical conditions. In addition, several observations are made
on the ASR performances of HD and FD transmissions.

 <dc:description>  We present a general theorem for distributed synthesis problems in
coordination games with $\omega$-regular objectives of the form: If there
exists a winning strategy for the coalition, then there exists an &quot;essential&quot;
winning strategy, that is obtained by a retraction of the given one. In
general, this does not lead to finite-state winning strategies, but when the
knowledge of agents remains bounded, we can solve the synthesis problem. Our
study is carried out in a setting where objectives are expressed in terms of
events that may \emph{not} be observable. This is natural in games of imperfect
information, rather than the common assumption that objectives are expressed in
terms of events that are observable to all agents. We characterise decidable
distributed synthesis problems in terms of finiteness of knowledge states and
finite congruence classes induced by them.

 <dc:description>  The explosion of mobile video traffic imposes tremendous challenges on
present cellular networks. To alleviate the pressure on backhaul links and to
enhance the quality of experience (QoE) of video streaming service, small cell
base stations (SBS) with caching ability are introduced to assist the content
delivery. In this paper, we present the first study on the optimal caching
strategy of scalable video coding (SVC) streaming in small cell networks with
the consideration of channel diversity and video scalability. We formulate an
integer programming problem to maximize the average SVC QoE under the
constraint of cache size at each SBS. By establishing connections between QoE
and caching state of each video, we simplify the proactive caching of SVC as a
multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP), and propose a low-complexity algorithm
using dynamic programming. Our proactive caching strategy reveals the
structural properties of cache allocation to each video based on their
popularity profiles. Simulation results manifest that the SBSs with caching
ability can greatly improve the average QoE of SVC streaming service, and that
our proposed caching strategy acquires significant performance gain compared
with other conventional caching policies.

 <dc:description>  Demand-side management presents significant benefits in reducing the energy
load in smart grids by balancing consumption demands or including energy
generation and/or storage devices in the user's side. These techniques
coordinate the energy load so that users minimize their monetary expenditure.
However, these methods require accurate predictions in the energy consumption
profiles, which make them inflexible to real demand variations. In this paper
we propose a realistic model that accounts for uncertainty in these variations
and calculates a robust price for all users in the smart grid. We analyze the
existence of solutions for this novel scenario, propose convergent distributed
algorithms to find them, and perform simulations considering energy
expenditure. We show that this model can effectively reduce the monetary
expenses for all users in a real-time market, while at the same time it
provides a reliable production cost estimate to the energy supplier.

 <dc:description>  We study pattern matching problems on two major representations of uncertain
sequences used in molecular biology: weighted sequences (also known as position
weight matrices, PWM) and profiles (i.e., scoring matrices). In the simple
version, in which only the pattern or only the text is uncertain, we obtain
efficient algorithms with theoretically-provable running times using a
variation of the lookahead scoring technique. We also consider a general
variant of the pattern matching problems in which both the pattern and the text
are uncertain. Central to our solution is a special case where the sequences
have equal length, called the consensus problem. We propose algorithms for the
consensus problem parameterized by the number of strings that match one of the
sequences. As our basic approach, a careful adaptation of the classic
meet-in-the-middle algorithm for the knapsack problem is used. On the lower
bound side, we prove that our dependence on the parameter is optimal up to
lower-order terms conditioned on the optimality of the original algorithm for
the knapsack problem.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the comparison of compression algorithms for voice
transferring method over SMS in satellite communication. Voice transferring
method over SMS is useful in situations when signal strength is low and due to
poor signal strength voice call connection is not possible to initiate or
signal dropped during voice call. This method has one serious flaw that it
produces large number of SMS while converting voice into SMS. Such issue is
catered to some extend by employing any compression algorithm. In this paper
our major aim is to find best compression scheme for said method, for that
purpose we compare 6 different types of compression algorithms which are; LZW
(Lempel-Ziv-Welch), Huffman coding, PPM (Prediction by partial matching),
Arithmetic Coding (AC), BWT (Burrows-Wheeler-Transform), LZMA
(Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain). This comparison shows that PPM compression method
offers better compression ratio and produce small number of SMS. For
experimentation we use Thuraya SG-2520 satellite phone. Moreover, we develop an
application using J2ME platform[Ref:a]. We tested that application more than
100 times and then we compare the result in terms of compression ratio of each
algorithm and number of connected SMS produce after each compression method.
The result of this study will help developers to choose better compression
scheme for their respective applications.

 <dc:description>  We strive for spatio-temporal localization of actions in videos. The
state-of-the-art relies on action proposals at test time and selects the best
one with a classifier trained on carefully annotated box annotations.
Annotating action boxes in video is cumbersome, tedious, and error prone.
Rather than annotating boxes, we propose to annotate actions in video with
points on a sparse subset of frames only. We introduce an overlap measure
between action proposals and points and incorporate them all into the objective
of a non-convex Multiple Instance Learning optimization. Experimental
evaluation on the UCF Sports and UCF 101 datasets shows that (i)
spatio-temporal proposals can be used to train classifiers while retaining the
localization performance, (ii) point annotations yield results comparable to
box annotations while being significantly faster to annotate, (iii) with a
minimum amount of supervision our approach is competitive to the
state-of-the-art. Finally, we introduce spatio-temporal action annotations on
the train and test videos of Hollywood2, resulting in Hollywood2Tubes,
available at http://tinyurl.com/hollywood2tubes.

 <dc:description>  Micro-burst traffic is not uncommon in data centers. It can cause packet
dropping, which results in serious performance degradation (e.g., Incast
problem). However, current solutions that attempt to suppress micro-burst
traffic are extrinsic and ad hoc, since they lack the comprehensive and
essential understanding of micro-burst's root cause and dynamic behavior. On
the other hand, traditional studies focus on traffic burstiness in a single
flow, while in data centers micro-burst traffic could occur with highly fan-in
communication pattern, and its dynamic behavior is still unclear. To this end,
in this paper we re-examine the micro-burst traffic in typical data center
scenarios. We find that evolution of micro-burst is determined by both TCP's
self-clocking mechanism and bottleneck link. Besides, dynamic behaviors of
micro-burst under various scenarios can all be described by the slope of queue
length increasing. Our observations also implicate that conventional solutions
like absorbing and pacing are ineffective to mitigate micro-burst traffic.
Instead, senders need to slow down as soon as possible. Inspired by the
findings and insights from experimental observations, we propose S-ECN policy,
which is an ECN marking policy leveraging the slope of queue length increasing.
Transport protocols utilizing S-ECN policy can suppress the sharp queue length
increment by over 50%, and reduce the 99th percentile of query completion time
by ~20%.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study how to play (stochastic) games optimally using little
space. We focus on repeated games with absorbing states, a type of two-player,
zero-sum concurrent mean-payoff games. The prototypical example of these games
is the well known Big Match of Gillete (1957). These games may not allow
optimal strategies but they always have {\epsilon}-optimal strategies. In this
paper we design {\epsilon}-optimal strategies for Player 1 in these games that
use only O(log log T ) space. Furthermore, we construct strategies for Player 1
that use space s(T), for an arbitrary small unbounded non-decreasing function
s, and which guarantee an {\epsilon}-optimal value for Player 1 in the limit
superior sense. The previously known strategies use space {\Omega}(logT) and it
was known that no strategy can use constant space if it is {\epsilon}-optimal
even in the limit superior sense. We also give a complementary lower bound.
Furthermore, we also show that no Markov strategy, even extended with finite
memory, can ensure value greater than 0 in the Big Match, answering a question
posed by Abraham Neyman.

 <dc:description>  Social networks have been popular platforms for information propagation. An
important use case is viral marketing: given a promotion budget, an advertiser
can choose some influential users as the seed set and provide them free or
discounted sample products; in this way, the advertiser hopes to increase the
popularity of the product in the users' friend circles by the world-of-mouth
effect, and thus maximizes the number of users that information of the
production can reach. There has been a body of literature studying the
influence maximization problem. Nevertheless, the existing studies mostly
investigate the problem on a one-off basis, assuming fixed known influence
probabilities among users, or the knowledge of the exact social network
topology. In practice, the social network topology and the influence
probabilities are typically unknown to the advertiser, which can be varying
over time, i.e., in cases of newly established, strengthened or weakened social
ties. In this paper, we focus on a dynamic non-stationary social network and
design a randomized algorithm, RSB, based on multi-armed bandit optimization,
to maximize influence propagation over time. The algorithm produces a sequence
of online decisions and calibrates its explore-exploit strategy utilizing
outcomes of previous decisions. It is rigorously proven to achieve an
upper-bounded regret in reward and applicable to large-scale social networks.
Practical effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated using both synthetic and
real-world datasets, which demonstrates that our algorithm outperforms previous
stationary methods under non-stationary conditions.

 <dc:description>  Service-Oriented Computing is a paradigm that uses services as building
blocks for building distributed applications. The primary motivation for
orchestrating services in the cloud used to be distributed business processes,
which drove the standardization of the Business Process Execution Language
(BPEL) and its central notion that a service is a business process. In recent
years, there has been a transition towards other motivations for orchestrating
services in the cloud, {\em e.g.}, XaaS, RMAD. Although it is theoretically
possible to make all of those services into WSDL/SOAP services, it would be too
complicated and costly for industry adoption. Therefore, the central notion
that a service is a business process is too restrictive. Instead, we view a
service as a technology neutral, loosely coupled, location transparent
procedure. With these ideas in mind, we introduce a new approach to services
orchestration: Ozy, a general orchestration container. We define this new
approach in terms of existing technology, and we show that the Ozy container
relaxes many traditional constraints and allows for simpler, more feature-rich
applications.

 <dc:description>  A decentralized coded caching scheme based on independent random content
placement has been proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, and has been shown to
achieve an order-optimal memory-load tradeoff when the file size goes to
infinity. It was then successively shown by Shanmugam et al. that in the
practical operating regime where the file size is limited such scheme yields
much less attractive load gain. In this paper, we propose a decentralized
random coded caching scheme and a partially decentralized sequential coded
caching scheme with different coordination requirements in the content
placement phase. The proposed content placement and delivery methods aim at
ensuring abundant coded-multicasting opportunities in the content delivery
phase when the file size is finite. We first analyze the loads of the two
proposed schemes and show that the sequential scheme outperforms the random
scheme in the finite file size regime. We also show that both our proposed
schemes outperform Maddah-Ali--Niesen's and Shanmugam et al.'s decentralized
schemes for finite file size, when the number of users is sufficiently large.
Then, we show that our schemes achieve the same memory-load tradeoff as
Maddah-Ali--Niesen's decentralized scheme when the file size goes to infinity,
and hence are also order optimal. Finally, we analyze the load gains of the two
proposed schemes and characterize the corresponding required file sizes.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent trend of touch-screen devices produces an accessibility barrier for
visually impaired people. On the other hand, these devices come with sensors
such as accelerometer. This calls for new approaches to human computer
interface (HCI). In this study, our aim is to find an alternative approach to
classify 20 different hand gestures captured by iPhone 3GS's built-in
accelerometer and make high accuracy on user-independent classifications using
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with dynamic warping window sizes. 20 gestures with
1,100 gesture data are collected from 15 normal-visioned people. This data set
is used for training. Experiment-1 based on this data set produced an accuracy
rate of 96.7~\%. In order for visually impaired people to use the system, a
gesture recognition based &quot;talking&quot; calculator is implemented. In Experiment-2,
4 visually impaired end-users used the calculator and obtained 95.5~\% accuracy
rate among 17 gestures with 720 gesture data totally. Contributions of the
techniques to the end result is also investigated. Dynamic warping window size
is found to be the most effective one. The data and the code is available.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we investigate a domination set problem variant on
vertex-weighted graphs. In the last few years, several algorithms have been
presented for solving the minimum alpha and alpha-rate domination problem (also
known as the positive influence dominating sets problem) on simple graphs. We
recently proposed an algorithm for alpha-rate domination on weighted graphs
based on randomised rounding of the solution of a linear programming
formulation of this problem. Due to the use of linear programming, such an
algorithm could be relatively time consuming for larger graphs. Here, we
propose a new version using the divide and conquer technique, which uses a
graph's community structure to create a solution from the solutions obtained on
denser subgraphs (with some adjustments, if necessary). We also investigate
greedy techniques for this problem using three different initial vertex
selection strategies. We compare two different randomised rounding and three
greedy algorithms on three different families of randomly generated graphs and
on four real-world graphs obtained from a Twitter mentions network. Our results
show that on dense random graphs the divide and conquer technique produces
results comparable in total weight to the unembellished randomised rounding
method, but signifficantly faster. For graphs with intrinsic modular structure,
the divide and conquer technique actually produces better results. When the
running time is prioritised over the optimality of results, two of the three
explored greedy algorithms strategies perform better than the simple strategy
of picking always vertices with the smallest weights. Also, greedy techniques
outperform randomised algorithms on the very sparse Twitter graphs, and on the
random dense graphs for high thresholds.

 <dc:description>  Superregular matrices have the property that all of their submatrices, which
can be full rank are so. Lower triangular superregular matrices are useful for
e.g., maximum distance separable convolutional codes as well as for
(sequential) network codes. In this work, we provide an explicit design for all
superregular lower triangular Toeplitz matrices in GF(2^p) for the case of
matrices with dimensions less than or equal to 5 x 5. For higher dimensional
matrices, we present a greedy algorithm that finds a solution provided the
field size is sufficiently high. We also introduce the notions of jointly
superregular and product preserving jointly superregular matrices, and extend
our explicit constructions of superregular matrices to these cases. Jointly
superregular matrices are necessary to achieve optimal decoding capabilities
for the case of codes with a rate lower than 1/2 , and the product preserving
property is necessary for optimal decoding capabilities in network recoding.

 <dc:title>$\ell_p$-Box ADMM: A Versatile Framework for Integer Programming</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper revisits the integer programming (IP) problem, which plays a
fundamental role in many computer vision and machine learning applications. The
literature abounds with many seminal works that address this problem, some
focusing on continuous approaches (e.g. linear program relaxation) while others
on discrete ones (e.g., min-cut). However, a limited number of them are
designed to handle the general IP form and even these methods cannot adequately
satisfy the simultaneous requirements of accuracy, feasibility, and
scalability. To this end, we propose a novel and versatile framework called
$\ell_p$-box ADMM, which is based on two parts. (1) The discrete constraint is
equivalently replaced by the intersection of a box and a $(n-1)$-dimensional
sphere (defined through the $\ell_p$ norm). (2) We infuse this equivalence into
the ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) framework to handle
these continuous constraints separately and to harness its attractive
properties. More importantly, the ADMM update steps can lead to manageable
sub-problems in the continuous domain. To demonstrate its efficacy, we consider
an instance of the framework, namely $\ell_2$-box ADMM applied to binary
quadratic programming (BQP). Here, the ADMM steps are simple, computationally
efficient, and theoretically guaranteed to converge to a KKT point. We
demonstrate the applicability of $\ell_2$-box ADMM on three important
applications: MRF energy minimization, graph matching, and clustering. Results
clearly show that it significantly outperforms existing generic IP solvers both
in runtime and objective. It also achieves very competitive performance vs.
state-of-the-art methods specific to these applications.

 <dc:description>  The deep two-stream architecture exhibited excellent performance on video
based action recognition. The most computationally expensive step in this
approach comes from the calculation of optical flow which prevents it to be
real-time. This paper accelerates this architecture by replacing optical flow
with motion vector which can be obtained directly from compressed videos
without extra calculation. However, motion vector lacks fine structures, and
contains noisy and inaccurate motion patterns, leading to the evident
degradation of recognition performance. Our key insight for relieving this
problem is that optical flow and motion vector are inherent correlated.
Transferring the knowledge learned with optical flow CNN to motion vector CNN
can significantly boost the performance of the latter. Specifically, we
introduce three strategies for this, initialization transfer, supervision
transfer and their combination. Experimental results show that our method
achieves comparable recognition performance to the state-of-the-art, while our
method can process 390.7 frames per second, which is 27 times faster than the
original two-stream method.

 <dc:title>Enabling All-Node-Repair in Minimum Storage Regenerating Codes</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of constructing exact-repair minimum storage
regenerating (MSR) codes, for which both the systematic nodes and parity nodes
can be repaired optimally. Although there exist several recent explicit
high-rate MSR code constructions (usually with certain restrictions on the
coding parameters), quite a few constructions in the literature only allow the
optimal repair of systematic nodes. This phenomenon suggests that there might
be a barrier between explicitly constructing codes that can only optimally
repair systematic nodes and those that can optimally repair both systematic
nodes and parity nodes. In the work, we show that this barrier can be
completely circumvented by providing a generic transformation that is able to
convert any non-binary linear maximum distance separable (MDS) storage codes
that can optimally repair only systematic nodes into new MSR codes that can
optimally repair all nodes. This transformation does not increase the alphabet
size of the original codes, and only increases the sub-packetization by a
factor that is equal to the number of parity nodes. Furthermore, the resultant
MSR codes also have the optimal access property for all nodes if the original
MDS storage codes have the optimal access property for systematic nodes.

 <dc:description>  This study explores how a swarm of aerial mobile vehicles can provide network

disaster relief operations. In this context, we design a physics-based
controlled mobility strategy, which we name the extended Virtual Force Protocol
(VFPe), allowing self-propelled nodes, and in particular here unmanned aerial
vehicles, to fly autonomously and cooperatively. In this way, ground devices
scattered on the operation site may establish communications through the
wireless multi-hop communication routes formed by the network of aerial nodes.
We further investigate through simulations the behavior of the VFPe protocol,
notably focusing on the way node location information is disseminated into the
network as well as on the impact of the number of exploration nodes on the
overall network performance.

 <dc:description>  Edge-preserving smoothing (EPS) can be formulated as minimizing an objective
function that consists of data and prior terms. This global EPS approach shows
better smoothing performance than a local one that typically has a form of
weighted averaging, at the price of high computational cost. In this paper, we
introduce a highly efficient splitting-based method for global EPS that
minimizes the objective function of ${l_2}$ data and prior terms (possibly
non-smooth and non-convex) in linear time. Different from previous
splitting-based methods that require solving a large linear system, our
approach solves an equivalent constrained optimization problem, resulting in a
sequence of 1D sub-problems. This enables linear time solvers for
weighted-least squares and -total variation problems. Our solver converges
quickly, and its runtime is even comparable to state-of-the-art local EPS
approaches. We also propose a family of fast iteratively re-weighted algorithms
using a non-convex prior term. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of our approach in a range of computer vision and
image processing tasks.

We present the main wireless technologies, software architectures and protocols
that need to be exploited, such as multihop, multipath communication and
mobility support through multihoming. We present Always Best Packet Switching

the need to change the current network infrastructure and configuration. This
is in accordance with the need of having cheap solutions that may work in a

 <dc:description>  As a genetics-based machine learning technique, zeroth-level classifier
system (ZCS) is based on a discounted reward reinforcement learning algorithm,
bucket-brigade algorithm, which optimizes the discounted total reward received
by an agent but is not suitable for all multi-step problems, especially
large-size ones. There are some undiscounted reinforcement learning methods
available, such as R-learning, which optimize the average reward per time step.
In this paper, R-learning is used as the reinforcement learning employed by
ZCS, to replace its discounted reward reinforcement learning approach, and
tournament selection is used to replace roulette wheel selection in ZCS. The
modification results in classifier systems that can support long action chains,
and thus is able to solve large multi-step problems.

asymptotic regret rate of any centralised algorithm that can instantly

 <dc:title>Condorcet's Jury Theorem for Consensus Clustering and its Implications
  for Diversity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Condorcet's Jury Theorem has been invoked for ensemble classifiers to
indicate that the combination of many classifiers can have better predictive
performance than a single classifier. Such a theoretical underpinning is
unknown for consensus clustering. This article extends Condorcet's Jury Theorem
to the mean partition approach under the additional assumptions that a unique
ground-truth partition exists and sample partitions are drawn from a
sufficiently small ball containing the ground-truth. As an implication of
practical relevance, we question the claim that the quality of consensus
clustering depends on the diversity of the sample partitions. Instead, we
conjecture that limiting the diversity of the mean partitions is necessary for
controlling the quality.

 <dc:description>  Multi-layer graphs consist of several graphs (layers) over the same vertex
set. They are motivated by real-world problems where entities (vertices) are
associated via multiple types of relationships (edges in different layers). We
chart the border of computational (in)tractability for the class of subgraph
detection problems on multi-layer graphs, including fundamental problems such
as maximum matching, finding certain clique relaxations (motivated by community
detection), or path problems. Mostly encountering hardness results, sometimes
even for two or three layers, we can also spot some islands of tractability.

 <dc:description>  The rapid growth of population in urban areas is jeopardizing the mobility
and air quality worldwide. One of the most notable problems arising is that of
traffic congestion which in turn affects air pollution. With the advent of
technologies able to sense real-time data about cities, and its public
distribution for analysis, we are in place to forecast scenarios valuable to
ameliorate and control congestion. Here, we propose a local congestion pricing
scheme, hotspot-pricing, that surcharges vehicles traversing congested
junctions. The proposed tax is computed from the estimation of the evolution of
congestion at local level, and the expected response of users to the tax
(elasticity). Results on cities' road networks, considering real-traffic data,
show that the proposed hotspot-pricing scheme would be more effective than
current mechanisms to decongest urban areas, and paves the way towards
sustainable congestion in urban areas.

 <dc:description>  We study automaton groups without singular points, that is, points in the
boundary for which the map that associates to each point its stabilizer, is not
continuous. This is motivated by the problem of finding examples of infinite
bireversible automaton groups with all trivial stabilizers in the boundary,
raised by Grigorchuk and Savchuk. We show that, in general, the set of singular
points has measure zero. Then we focus our attention on several classes of
automata. We characterize those contracting automata generating groups without
singular points, and apply this characterization to the Basilica group. We
prove that potential examples of reversible automata generating infinite groups
without singular points are necessarily bireversible. Then we provide some
necessary conditions for such examples to exist, and study some dynamical
properties of their Schreier graphs in the boundary. Finally we relate some of
those automata with aperiodic tilings of the discrete plane via Wang tilings.
This has a series of consequences from the algorithmic and dynamical points of
view, and is related to a problem of Gromov regarding the searching for
examples of CAT(0) complexes whose fundamental groups are not hyperbolic and
contain no subgroup isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.

 <dc:description>  The possibility of sharing one's point of view makes use of wearable cameras
compelling. These videos are often long, boring and coupled with extreme shake,
as the camera is worn on a moving person. Fast forwarding (i.e. frame sampling)
is a natural choice for quick video browsing. However, this accentuates the
shake caused by natural head motion in an egocentric video, making the fast
forwarded video useless. We propose EgoSampling, an adaptive frame sampling
that gives stable, fast forwarded, hyperlapse videos. Adaptive frame sampling
is formulated as an energy minimization problem, whose optimal solution can be
found in polynomial time. We further turn the camera shake from a drawback into
a feature, enabling the increase in field-of-view of the output video. This is
obtained when each output frame is mosaiced from several input frames. The
proposed technique also enables the generation of a single hyperlapse video
from multiple egocentric videos, allowing even faster video consumption.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an efficient method for the reconstruction of the correlation
between a compressively measured image and a phase-only filter. The proposed
method is based on two properties of phase-only filtering: such filtering is a
unitary circulant transform, and the correlation plane it produces is usually
sparse. Thanks to these properties, phase-only filters are perfectly compatible
with the framework of compressive sensing. Moreover, the lasso-based recovery
algorithm is very fast when phase-only filtering is used as the compression
matrix. The proposed method can be seen as a generalisation of the
correlation-based pattern recognition technique, which is hereby applied
directly to non-adaptively acquired compressed data. At the time of
measurement, any prior knowledge of the target object for which the data will
be scanned is not required. We show that images measured at extremely high
compression rates may still contain sufficient information for target
classification and localization, even if the compression rate is high enough,
that visual recognition of the target in the reconstructed image is no longer
possible. The method has been applied by us to highly undersampled measurements
obtained from a single-pixel camera, with sampling based on randomly chosen
Walsh-Hadamard patterns.

 <dc:title>F-measure Maximization in Multi-Label Classification with Conditionally
  Independent Label Subsets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gasse, Maxime</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Aussem, Alex</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We discuss a method to improve the exact F-measure maximization algorithm
called GFM, proposed in (Dembczynski et al. 2011) for multi-label
classification, assuming the label set can be can partitioned into
conditionally independent subsets given the input features. If the labels were
all independent, the estimation of only $m$ parameters ($m$ denoting the number
of labels) would suffice to derive Bayes-optimal predictions in $O(m^2)$
operations. In the general case, $m^2+1$ parameters are required by GFM, to
solve the problem in $O(m^3)$ operations. In this work, we show that the number
of parameters can be reduced further to $m^2/n$, in the best case, assuming the
label set can be partitioned into $n$ conditionally independent subsets. As
this label partition needs to be estimated from the data beforehand, we use
first the procedure proposed in (Gasse et al. 2015) that finds such partition
and then infer the required parameters locally in each label subset. The latter
are aggregated and serve as input to GFM to form the Bayes-optimal prediction.
We show on a synthetic experiment that the reduction in the number of
parameters brings about significant benefits in terms of performance.

 <dc:description>  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is pertinent to many applications with varied
network parameters. Sensor node placement in the application region whether it
is indoor or outdoor is a major task as well as plays very remarkable role in
the network performance. Node placement is carried out according to the region
where it is applied, either deterministic or non deterministic. Because of the
need for different sensing probability or detection probability, same approach
of sensor placement may not be suited for all the applications. Some of the
applications are well formed and give better performance with the uniform
distribution of sensors but few need intense distribution of nodes in
particular sensitive places especially those applications meant for intrusion
detection. An application which needs high level intrusion detection and a
suitable sensor distribution methodology, known as Half-Normal Distribution
(Half-Gaussian) based deployment, have been set forth in this paper. We have
also discussed the theoretical comparison for detection probability with the
uniform distribution in terms of number of sensor nodes.

 <dc:description>  Non-linear voter models assume that the opinion of an agent depends on the
opinions of its neighbors in a non-linear manner. This allows for voting rules
different from majority voting. While the linear voter model is known to reach
consensus, non-linear voter models can result in the coexistence of opposite
opinions. Our aim is to derive approximations to correctly predict the time
dependent dynamics, or at least the asymptotic outcome, of such local
interactions. Emphasis is on a probabilistic approach to decompose the opinion
distribution in a second-order neighborhood into lower-order probability
distributions. This is compared with an analytic pair approximation for the
expected value of the global fraction of opinions and a mean-field
approximation. Our reference case are averaged stochastic simulations of a
one-dimensional cellular automaton. We find that the probabilistic second-order
approach captures the dynamics of the reference case very well for different
non-linearities, i.e for both majority and minority voting rules, which only
partly holds for the first-order pair approximation and not at all for the
mean-field approximation. We further discuss the interesting phenomenon of a
correlated coexistence, characterized by the formation of large domains of
opinions that dominate for some time, but slowly change.

 <dc:description>  The article presents a study of some characteristics of post and comment
publishing in the Russian segment of Facebook. A number of non-trivial results
has been obtained. For example, a significant anomaly has been detected in the
number of user accounts with the rate of publishing posts of approximately two
posts per three days. The analysis has been carried out at the level of basic
characteristics that are shared by most social media platforms. It makes
possible a direct comparison of obtained results with data from other
platforms. The article presents an approach to formalization and ordering of
structural and informational elements on social media platforms. The approach
is based on the representation of these structural elements in the form of a
coherent hierarchy of container objects and their relations. This method allows
to structure and analyze raw data from different social media platforms in a
unified algorithmic design. The described approach is more formal, universal
and constructive than other known approaches.

 <dc:title>A Framework for Human Pose Estimation in Videos</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Dong</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shah, Mubarak</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a method to estimate a sequence of human poses in
unconstrained videos. We aim to demonstrate that by using temporal information,
the human pose estimation results can be improved over image based pose
estimation methods. In contrast to the commonly employed graph optimization
formulation, which is NP-hard and needs approximate solutions, we formulate
this problem into a unified two stage tree-based optimization problem for which
an efficient and exact solution exists. Although the proposed method finds an
exact solution, it does not sacrifice the ability to model the spatial and
temporal constraints between body parts in the frames; in fact it models the
{\em symmetric} parts better than the existing methods. The proposed method is
based on two main ideas: `Abstraction' and `Association' to enforce the intra-
and inter-frame body part constraints without inducing extra computational
complexity to the polynomial time solution. Using the idea of `Abstraction', a
new concept of `abstract body part' is introduced to conceptually combine the
symmetric body parts and model them in the tree based body part structure.
Using the idea of `Association', the optimal tracklets are generated for each
abstract body part, in order to enforce the spatiotemporal constraints between
body parts in adjacent frames. A sequence of the best poses is inferred from
the abstract body part tracklets through the tree-based optimization. Finally,
the poses are refined by limb alignment and refinement schemes. We evaluated
the proposed method on three publicly available video based human pose
estimation datasets, and obtained dramatically improved performance compared to
the state-of-the-art methods.

improper scaling between layers. Scaling issues introduce exploding / gradient
problems, and have typically been addressed by careful scale-preserving
initialization. We investigate the value of preserving scale, or isometry,
beyond the initial weights. We propose two methods of maintaing isometry, one
exact and one stochastic. Preliminary experiments show that for both
determinant and scale-normalization effectively speeds up learning. Results
suggest that isometry is important in the beginning of learning, and
maintaining it leads to faster learning.

 <dc:title>The Systematic Normal Form of Lattices</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Eldar, Lior</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shor, Peter W.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a new canonical form of lattices called the systematic normal
form (SNF). We show that for every lattice there is an efficiently computable
&quot;nearby&quot; SNF lattice, such that for any lattice one can solve lattice problems
on its &quot;nearby&quot; SNF lattice, and translate the solutions back efficiently to
the original lattice. The SNF provides direct connections between arbitrary
lattices, and various lattice related problems like the
Shortest-Integer-Solution, Approximate Greatest Common Divisor. As our main
application of SNF we derive a new set of worst-to-average case lattice
reductions that deviate significantly from the template of Ajtai and improve
upon previous reductions in terms of simplicity.

 <dc:description>  Quantum-dot fabrication and characterization is a well-established
technology, which is used in photonics, quantum optics and nanoelectronics.
Four quantum-dots placed at the corners of a square form a unit cell, which can
hold a bit of information and serve as a basis for Quantum-dot Cellular
Automata (QCA) nanoelectronic circuits. Although several basic QCA circuits
have been designed, fabricated and tested, proving that quantum-dots can form
functional, fast and low-power nanoelectornic circuits, QCA nanoelectronics
still remain at its infancy. One of the reasons for this is the lack of design
automation tools, which will facilitate the systematic design of large QCA
circuits that contemporary applications demand. Here we present novel,
programmable QCA circuits, which are based on crossbar architecture. These
circuits can be programmed to implement any Boolean function in analogy to CMOS
FPGAs and open the road that will lead to full design automation of QCA
nanoelectronic circuits. Using this architecture we designed and simulated QCA
circuits that proved to be area efficient, stable and reliable.

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on the problem of consistency in distributed data
stores.We define strong consistency model which provides a simple semantics for
application programmers, but impossible to achieve with availability and
partition-tolerance. We also define weaker consistency models including causal
and eventual consistency. We review COPS and GentleRain as two causally
consistent data stores as well as Dynamo as an eventually consistent data
store. We provide insights about scenarios where each of these methods is
suitable, and some future research directions.

 <dc:title>Using Indirect Encoding of Multiple Brains to Produce Multimodal

 <dc:description>  An important challenge in neuroevolution is to evolve complex neural networks
with multiple modes of behavior. Indirect encodings can potentially answer this
challenge. Yet in practice, indirect encodings do not yield effective
multimodal controllers. Thus, this paper introduces novel multimodal extensions
to HyperNEAT, a popular indirect encoding. A previous multimodal HyperNEAT
approach called situational policy geometry assumes that multiple brains
benefit from being embedded within an explicit geometric space. However,
experiments here illustrate that this assumption unnecessarily constrains
evolution, resulting in lower performance. Specifically, this paper introduces
HyperNEAT extensions for evolving many brains without assuming geometric
relationships between them. The resulting Multi-Brain HyperNEAT can exploit
human-specified task divisions to decide when each brain controls the agent, or
can automatically discover when brains should be used, by means of preference
neurons. A further extension called module mutation allows evolution to
discover the number of brains, enabling multimodal behavior with even less
expert knowledge. Experiments in several multimodal domains highlight that
multi-brain approaches are more effective than HyperNEAT without multimodal
extensions, and show that brains without a geometric relation to each other
outperform situational policy geometry. The conclusion is that Multi-Brain
HyperNEAT provides several promising techniques for evolving complex multimodal
behavior.

 <dc:description>  Feature representation and metric learning are two critical components in
person re-identification models. In this paper, we focus on the feature
representation and claim that hand-crafted histogram features can be
complementary to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features. We propose a
novel feature extraction model called Feature Fusion Net (FFN) for pedestrian
image representation. In FFN, back propagation makes CNN features constrained
by the handcrafted features. Utilizing color histogram features (RGB, HSV,
YCbCr, Lab and YIQ) and texture features (multi-scale and multi-orientation
Gabor features), we get a new deep feature representation that is more
discriminative and compact. Experiments on three challenging datasets (VIPeR,
CUHK01, PRID450s) validates the effectiveness of our proposal.

 <dc:title>Entities as topic labels: Improving topic interpretability and

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In order to create a corpus exploration method providing topics that are
easier to interpret than standard LDA topic models, here we propose combining
two techniques called Entity linking and Labeled LDA. Our method identifies in
an ontology a series of descriptive labels for each document in a corpus. Then
it generates a specific topic for each label. Having a direct relation between
topics and labels makes interpretation easier; using an ontology as background
knowledge limits label ambiguity. As our topics are described with a limited
number of clear-cut labels, they promote interpretability, and this may help
quantitative evaluation. We illustrate the potential of the approach by
applying it in order to define the most relevant topics addressed by each party
in the European Parliament's fifth mandate (1999-2004).

 <dc:description>  Recently it has been reported that range-measurement inconsistency, or
equivalently mismatches in prescribed inter-agent distances, may prevent the
popular gradient controllers from guiding rigid formations of mobile agents to
converge to their desired shape, and even worse from standing still at any
location. In this paper, instead of treating mismatches as the source of ill
performance, we take them as design parameters and show that by introducing
such a pair of parameters per distance constraint, distributed controller
achieving simultaneously both formation and motion control can be designed that
not only encompasses the popular gradient control, but more importantly allows
us to achieve constant collective translation, rotation or their combination
while guaranteeing asymptotically no distortion in the formation shape occurs.
Such motion control results are then applied to (a) the alignment of formations
orientations and (b) enclosing and tracking a moving target. Besides rigorous
mathematical proof, experiments using mobile robots are demonstrated to show
the satisfying performances of the proposed formation-motion distributed
controller.

 <dc:description>  Trilateration has recently become one of the well-known threat models to the
user's location privacy in location-based applications (aka: location-based
services or LBS), especially those containing highly sensitive information such
as dating applications. The threat model mainly depends on the distance shown
from the targeted victim to the adversary to pinpoint the victim's position. As
a countermeasure, most of location-based applications have already implemented
the &quot;hide distance&quot; function to protect their user's location privacy. The
effectiveness of such approaches however is still questionable. Therefore, in
this paper, we first investigate how popular location-based dating applications
are currently protecting their user's privacy by testing the two most popular
GLBT-focused applications: Jack'd and Grindr.

perform computational simulations under various model parameters to demonstrate

 <dc:description>  We give constructions of self-dual and formally self-dual codes from group
rings where the ring is a finite commutative Frobenius ring. We improve the
existing construction given in \cite{Hurley1} by showing that one of the
conditions given in the theorem is unnecessary and moreover it restricts the
number of self-dual codes obtained by the construction. We show that several of
the standard constructions of self-dual codes are found within our general
framework. We prove that our constructed codes correspond to ideals in the
group ring $RG$ and as such must have an automorphism group that contains $G$
as a subgroup. We also prove that a common construction technique for producing
self-dual codes cannot produce the putative $[72,36,16]$ Type~II code.
Additionally, we show precisely which groups can be used to construct the
extremal Type II codes over length 24 and 48.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel approach to the task of data association within
the context of pedestrian tracking, by introducing a two-stage learning scheme
to match pairs of detections. First, a Siamese convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained to learn descriptors encoding local spatio-temporal structures
between the two input image patches, aggregating pixel values and optical flow
information. Second, a set of contextual features derived from the position and
size of the compared input patches are combined with the CNN output by means of
a gradient boosting classifier to generate the final matching probability. This
learning approach is validated by using a linear programming based multi-person
tracker showing that even a simple and efficient tracker may outperform much
more complex models when fed with our learned matching probabilities. Results
on publicly available sequences show that our method meets state-of-the-art
standards in multiple people tracking.

 <dc:description>  Are face and object recognition abilities independent? Although it is
commonly believed that they are, Gauthier et al.(2014) recently showed that
these abilities become more correlated as experience with nonface categories
increases. They argued that there is a single underlying visual ability, v,
that is expressed in performance with both face and nonface categories as
experience grows. Using the Cambridge Face Memory Test and the Vanderbilt
Expertise Test, they showed that the shared variance between Cambridge Face
Memory Test and Vanderbilt Expertise Test performance increases monotonically
as experience increases. Here, we address why a shared resource across
different visual domains does not lead to competition and to an inverse
correlation in abilities? We explain this conundrum using our
neurocomputational model of face and object processing (The Model, TM). Our
results show that, as in the behavioral data, the correlation between
subordinate level face and object recognition accuracy increases as experience
grows. We suggest that different domains do not compete for resources because
the relevant features are shared between faces and objects. The essential power
of experience is to generate a &quot;spreading transform&quot; for faces that generalizes
to objects that must be individuated. Interestingly, when the task of the
network is basic level categorization, no increase in the correlation between
domains is observed. Hence, our model predicts that it is the type of
experience that matters and that the source of the correlation is in the
fusiform face area, rather than in cortical areas that subserve basic level
categorization. This result is consistent with our previous modeling
elucidating why the FFA is recruited for novel domains of expertise (Tong et
al., 2008).

 <dc:title>Cutting Algebraic Curves into Pseudo-segments and Applications</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We show that a set of $n$ algebraic plane curves of constant maximum degree
can be cut into $O(n^{3/2}\operatorname{polylog} n)$ Jordan arcs, so that each
pair of arcs intersect at most once, i.e., they form a collection of
pseudo-segments. This extends a similar (and slightly better) bound for
pseudo-circles due to Marcus and Tardos. Our result is based on a technique of
Ellenberg, Solymosi and Zahl that transforms arrangements of plane curves into
arrangements of space curves, so that lenses (pairs of subarcs of the curves
that intersect at least twice) become vertical depth cycles. We then apply a
variant of a technique of Aronov and Sharir to eliminate these depth cycles by
making a small number of cuts, which corresponds to a small number of cuts to
the original planar arrangement of curves. After these cuts have been
performed, the resulting curves form a collection of pseudo-segments.
  Our cutting bound leads to new incidence bounds between points and
constant-degree algebraic curves. The conditions for these incidence bounds are
slightly stricter than those for the current best-known bound of Pach and
Sharir; for our result to hold, the curves must be algebraic and of bounded
maximum degree, while Pach and Sharir's bound only imposes weaker, purely
topological constraints on the curves. However, when our conditions hold, the
new bounds are superior for almost all ranges of parameters. We also obtain new
bounds on the complexity of a single level in an arrangement of constant-degree
algebraic curves, and a new bound on the complexity of many marked faces in an
arrangement of such curves.

 <dc:description>  Finding meaningful communities in social network has attracted the attentions
of many researchers. The community structure of complex networks reveals both
their organization and hidden relations among their constituents. Most of the
researches in the field of community detection mainly focus on the topological
structure of the network without performing any content analysis. Nowadays,
real world social networks are containing a vast range of information including
shared objects, comments, following information, etc. In recent years, a number
of researches have proposed approaches which consider both the contents that
are interchanged in the networks and the topological structures of the networks
in order to find more meaningful communities. In this research, the effect of
topic analysis in finding more meaningful communities in social networking
sites in which the users express their feelings toward different objects (like
movies) by the means of rating is demonstrated by performing extensive
experiments.

 <dc:description>  Software defined radio (SDR) allows unprecedented levels of flexibility by
transitioning the radio communication system from a rigid hardware platform to
a more user-controlled software paradigm. However, it can still be time
consuming to design and implement such SDRs as they typically require thorough
knowledge of the operating environment and a careful tuning of the program. In
this work, our contribution is the design of a bidirectional transceiver that
runs on the commonly used USRP platform and implemented in MATLAB using
standard tools like MATLAB Coder and MEX to speed up the processing steps. We
outline strategies on how to create a state-action based design, wherein the
same node switches between transmitter and receiver functions. Our design
allows optimal selection of the parameters towards meeting the timing
requirements set forth by various processing blocks associated with a DBPSK
physical layer and CSMA/CA/ACK MAC layer so that all operations remain
functionally compliant with the IEEE 802.11b standard for the 1 Mbps
specification. The code base of the system is enabled through the
Communications System Toolbox and incorporates channel sensing and exponential
random back-off for contention resolution. The current work provides an
experimental testbed that enables creation of new MAC protocols starting from
the fundamental IEEE 802.11b standard. Our design approach guarantees
consistent performance of the bi-directional link, and the three node
experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the system in mitigating
packet collisions and enforcing fairness among nodes, making it a feasible
framework in higher layer protocol design.

 <dc:description>  We propose and study a novel continuous space-time model for wireless
networks which takes into account the stochastic interactions in both space
through interference and in time due to randomness in traffic. Our model
consists of an interacting particle birth-death dynamics incorporating
information-theoretic spectrum sharing. Roughly speaking, particles (or more
generally wireless links) arrive according to a Poisson Point Process on
space-time, and stay for a duration governed by the local configuration of
points present and then exit the network after completion of a file transfer.
We analyze this particle dynamics to derive an explicit condition for time
ergodicity (i.e. stability) which is tight. We also prove that when the
dynamics is ergodic, the steady-state point process of links (or particles)
exhibits a form statistical clustering. Based on the clustering, we propose a
conjecture which we leverage to derive approximations, bounds and asymptotics
on performance characteristics such as delay and mean number of links per
unit-space in the stationary regime. The mathematical analysis is combined with
discrete event simulation to study the performance of this type of networks.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is to provide a hierarchical dynamic mission
planning framework for a single autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to
accomplish task-assign process in a limited time interval while operating in an
uncertain undersea environment, where spatio-temporal variability of the
operating field is taken into account. To this end, a high level reactive
mission planner and a low level motion planning system are constructed. The
high level system is responsible for task priority assignment and guiding the
vehicle toward a target of interest considering on-time termination of the
mission. The lower layer is in charge of generating optimal trajectories based
on sequence of tasks and dynamicity of operating terrain. The mission planner
is able to reactively re-arrange the tasks based on mission/terrain updates
while the low level planner is capable of coping unexpected changes of the
terrain by correcting the old path and re-generating a new trajectory. As a
result, the vehicle is able to undertake the maximum number of tasks with
certain degree of maneuverability having situational awareness of the operating
field. The computational engine of the mentioned framework is based on the
biogeography based optimization (BBO) algorithm that is capable of providing
efficient solutions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework,
firstly, a realistic model of undersea environment is provided based on
realistic map data, and then several scenarios, treated as real experiments,
are designed through the simulation study. Additionally, to show the robustness
and reliability of the framework, Monte-Carlo simulation is carried out and
statistical analysis is performed. The results of simulations indicate the
significant potential of the two-level hierarchical mission planning system in
mission success and its applicability for real-time implementation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel approach that uses deep learning techniques
for colorizing grayscale images. By utilizing a pre-trained convolutional
neural network, which is originally designed for image classification, we are
able to separate content and style of different images and recombine them into
a single image. We then propose a method that can add colors to a grayscale
image by combining its content with style of a color image having semantic
similarity with the grayscale one. As an application, to our knowledge the
first of its kind, we use the proposed method to colorize images of ukiyo-e a
genre of Japanese painting?and obtain interesting results, showing the
potential of this method in the growing field of computer assisted art.

 <dc:description>  We study the nonlinear observability of a systems states in view of how well
they are observable and what control inputs would improve the convergence of
their estimates. We use these insights to develop an observability-aware
trajectory-optimization framework for nonlinear systems that produces
trajectories well suited for self-calibration. Common trajectory-planning
algorithms tend to generate motions that lead to an unobservable subspace of
the system state, causing suboptimal state estimation. We address this problem
with a method that reasons about the quality of observability while respecting
system dynamics and motion constraints to yield the optimal trajectory for
rapid convergence of the self-calibration states (or other user-chosen states).
Experiments performed on a simulated quadrotor system with a GPS-IMU sensor
suite demonstrate the benefits of the optimized observability-aware
trajectories when compared to a covariance-based approach and multiple
heuristic approaches. Our method is approx. 80x faster than the
covariance-based approach and achieves better results than any other approach
in the self-calibration task. We applied our method to a waypoint navigation
task and achieved a approx. 2x improvement in the integrated RMSE of the global
position estimates and approx. 4x improvement in the integrated RMSE of the
GPS-IMU transformation estimates compared to a minimal-energy trajectory
planner.

 <dc:description>  With years of tremendous traffic and energy consumption growth, green radio
has been valued not only for theoretical research interests but also for the
operational expenditure reduction and the sustainable development of wireless
communications. Fundamental green tradeoffs, served as an important framework
for analysis, include four basic relationships: spectrum efficiency (SE) versus
energy efficiency (EE), deployment efficiency (DE) versus energy efficiency
(EE), delay (DL) versus power (PW), and bandwidth (BW) versus power (PW). In
this paper, we first provide a comprehensive overview on the extensive on-going
research efforts and categorize them based on the fundamental green tradeoffs.
We will then focus on research progresses of 4G and 5G communications, such as
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and non-orthogonal
aggregation (NOA), multiple input multiple output (MIMO), and heterogeneous
networks (HetNets). We will also discuss potential challenges and impacts of
fundamental green tradeoffs, to shed some light on the energy efficient
research and design for future wireless networks.

 <dc:description>  An algorithmic framework, based on the difference of convex functions
algorithm (DCA), is proposed for minimizing a class of concave sparse metrics
for compressed sensing problems. The resulting algorithm iterates a sequence of
$\ell_1$ minimization problems. An exact sparse recovery theory is established
to show that the proposed framework always improves on the basis pursuit
($\ell_1$ minimization) and inherits robustness from it. Numerical examples on
success rates of sparse solution recovery illustrate further that, unlike most
existing non-convex compressed sensing solvers in the literature, our method
always out-performs basis pursuit, no matter how ill-conditioned the
measurement matrix is. Moreover, the iterative $\ell_1$ (IL$_1$) algorithm lead
by a wide margin the state-of-the-art algorithms on $\ell_{1/2}$ and
logarithimic minimizations in the strongly coherent (highly ill-conditioned)
regime, despite the same objective functions. Last but not least, in the
application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), IL$_1$ algorithm easily
recovers the phantom image with just 7 line projections.

 <dc:description>  Tensor factorization is a powerful tool to analyse multi-way data. Compared
with traditional multi-linear methods, nonlinear tensor factorization models
are capable of capturing more complex relationships in the data. However, they
are computationally expensive and may suffer severe learning bias in case of
extreme data sparsity. To overcome these limitations, in this paper we propose
a distributed, flexible nonlinear tensor factorization model. Our model can
effectively avoid the expensive computations and structural restrictions of the
Kronecker-product in existing TGP formulations, allowing an arbitrary subset of
tensorial entries to be selected to contribute to the training. At the same
time, we derive a tractable and tight variational evidence lower bound (ELBO)
that enables highly decoupled, parallel computations and high-quality
inference. Based on the new bound, we develop a distributed inference algorithm
in the MapReduce framework, which is key-value-free and can fully exploit the
memory cache mechanism in fast MapReduce systems such as SPARK. Experimental
results fully demonstrate the advantages of our method over several
state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of both predictive performance and
computational efficiency. Moreover, our approach shows a promising potential in
the application of Click-Through-Rate (CTR) prediction for online advertising.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of using image queries to retrieve videos from a
database. Our focus is on large-scale applications, where it is infeasible to
index each database video frame independently. Our main contribution is a
framework based on Bloom filters, which can be used to index long video
segments, enabling efficient image-to-video comparisons. Using this framework,
we investigate several retrieval architectures, by considering different types
of aggregation and different functions to encode visual information -- these
play a crucial role in achieving high performance. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed technique improves mean average precision by 24% on a public
dataset, while being 4X faster, compared to the previous state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  Establishing dense correspondences between multiple images is a fundamental
task in many applications. However, finding a reliable correspondence in
multi-modal or multi-spectral images still remains unsolved due to their
challenging photometric and geometric variations. In this paper, we propose a
novel dense descriptor, called dense adaptive self-correlation (DASC), to
estimate multi-modal and multi-spectral dense correspondences. Based on an
observation that self-similarity existing within images is robust to imaging
modality variations, we define the descriptor with a series of an adaptive
self-correlation similarity measure between patches sampled by a randomized
receptive field pooling, in which a sampling pattern is obtained using a
discriminative learning. The computational redundancy of dense descriptors is
dramatically reduced by applying fast edge-aware filtering. Furthermore, in
order to address geometric variations including scale and rotation, we propose
a geometry-invariant DASC (GI-DASC) descriptor that effectively leverages the
DASC through a superpixel-based representation. For a quantitative evaluation
of the GI-DASC, we build a novel multi-modal benchmark as varying photometric
and geometric conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding
performance of the DASC and GI-DASC in many cases of multi-modal and
multi-spectral dense correspondences.

 <dc:title>Graph Laplacian Regularization for Image Denoising: Analysis in the
  Continuous Domain</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pang, Jiahao</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Cheung, Gene</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Inverse imaging problems are inherently under-determined, and hence it is
important to employ appropriate image priors for regularization. One recent
popular prior---the graph Laplacian regularizer---assumes that the target pixel
patch is smooth with respect to an appropriately chosen graph. However, the
mechanisms and implications of imposing the graph Laplacian regularizer on the
original inverse problem are not well understood. To address this problem, in
this paper we interpret neighborhood graphs of pixel patches as discrete
counterparts of Riemannian manifolds and perform analysis in the continuous
domain, providing insights into several fundamental aspects of graph Laplacian
regularization for image denoising. Specifically, we first show the convergence
of the graph Laplacian regularizer to a continuous-domain functional,
integrating a norm measured in a locally adaptive metric space. Focusing on
image denoising, we derive an optimal metric space assuming non-local
self-similarity of pixel patches, leading to an optimal graph Laplacian
regularizer for denoising in the discrete domain. We then interpret graph
Laplacian regularization as an anisotropic diffusion scheme to explain its
behavior during iterations, e.g., its tendency to promote piecewise smooth
signals under certain settings. To verify our analysis, an iterative image
denoising algorithm is developed. Experimental results show that our algorithm
performs competitively with state-of-the-art denoising methods such as BM3D for
natural images, and outperforms them significantly for piecewise smooth images.

 <dc:title>Zero-shot object prediction using semantic scene knowledge</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work focuses on the semantic relations between scenes and objects for
visual object recognition. Semantic knowledge can be a powerful source of
information especially in scenarios with few or no annotated training samples.
These scenarios are referred to as zero-shot or few-shot recognition and often
build on visual attributes. Here, instead of relying on various visual
attributes, a more direct way is pursued: after recognizing the scene that is
depicted in an image, semantic relations between scenes and objects are used
for predicting the presence of objects in an unsupervised manner. Most
importantly, relations between scenes and objects can easily be obtained from
external sources such as large scale text corpora from the web and, therefore,
do not require tremendous manual labeling efforts. It will be shown that in
cluttered scenes, where visual recognition is difficult, scene knowledge is an
important cue for predicting objects.

 <dc:description>  The development of automatic nutrition diaries, which would allow to keep
track objectively of everything we eat, could enable a whole new world of
possibilities for people concerned about their nutrition patterns. With this
purpose, in this paper we propose the first method for simultaneous food
localization and recognition. Our method is based on two main steps, which
consist in, first, produce a food activation map on the input image (i.e. heat
map of probabilities) for generating bounding boxes proposals and, second,
recognize each of the food types or food-related objects present in each
bounding box. We demonstrate that our proposal, compared to the most similar
problem nowadays - object localization, is able to obtain high precision and
reasonable recall levels with only a few bounding boxes. Furthermore, we show
that it is applicable to both conventional and egocentric images.

 <dc:description>  Full-duplex (FD) cellular networks are considered in which a FD base station
(BS) simultaneously supports a set of half-duplex (HD) downlink (DL) users and
a set of HD uplink (UL) users. The transmitter and the receiver of the BS are
equipped with reconfigurable antennas, each of which can choose its transmit or
receive mode from several preset modes. Under the no self-interference
assumption arisen from FD operation at the BS, the sum degrees of freedom (DoF)
of FD cellular networks is investigated for both no channel state information
at the transmit side (CSIT) and partial CSIT. In particular, the sum DoF is
completely characterized for no CSIT model and an achievable sum DoF is
established for the partial CSIT model, which improves the sum DoF of the
conventional HD cellular networks. For both no CSIT and partial CSIT models,
the results show that the FD BS with reconfigurable antennas can double the sum
DoF even in the presence of user-to-user interference as both the numbers of DL
and UL users and preset modes increase. It is further demonstrated that such
DoF improvement indeed yields the sum rate improvement at the finite and
operational signal-to-noise ratio regime.

in which the broken-triangle pattern (BTP) does not occur, a class which
includes all tree-structured instances, are decided by arc consistency (AC), a
ubiquitous reduction operation in constraint solvers. We provide a
characterisation of simple partially-ordered forbidden patterns which have this
AC-solvability property. It turns out that BTP is just one of five such
AC-solvable patterns. The four other patterns allow us to exhibit new tractable
classes.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we discuss software design issues related to the development
of parallel computational intelligence algorithms on multi-core CPUs, using the
new Java 8 functional programming features. In particular, we focus on
probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and present the parallelisation of a
collection of algorithms that deal with inference and learning of PGMs from
data. Namely, maximum likelihood estimation, importance sampling, and greedy
search for solving combinatorial optimisation problems. Through these concrete
examples, we tackle the problem of defining efficient data structures for PGMs
and parallel processing of same-size batches of data sets using Java 8
features. We also provide straightforward techniques to code parallel
algorithms that seamlessly exploit multi-core processors. The experimental
analysis, carried out using our open source AMIDST (Analysis of MassIve Data
STreams) Java toolbox, shows the merits of the proposed solutions.

 <dc:description>  A social tagging system allows users to add arbitrary strings, called &quot;tags&quot;,
on a shared resource to organize and manage information. The Yule--Simon
process, which has shown the ability to capture the population dynamics of
social tagging behavior, does not handle the mechanism of new vocabulary
creation because it assumes that new vocabulary creation is a Poisson-like
random process. In this research, we focus on the mechanism of vocabulary
creation from the microscopic perspective and discuss whether it also follows
the random process assumed in the Yule--Simon process. To capture the
microscopic mechanism of vocabulary creation, we focus on the relationship
between the number of tags used in the same entry and the local vocabulary
creation rate. We find that the relationship is not the result of a simple
random process, and differs between services. Furthermore, these differences
depend on whether the user's tagging attitudes are private or open. These
results provide the potential for a new index to identify the service's
intrinsic nature.

 <dc:title>Context Tree based Image Contour Coding using A Geometric Prior</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  If object contours in images are coded efficiently as side information, then
they can facilitate advanced image / video coding techniques, such as graph
Fourier transform coding or motion prediction of arbitrarily shaped pixel
blocks. In this paper, we study the problem of lossless and lossy compression
of detected contours in images. Specifically, we first convert a detected
object contour composed of contiguous between-pixel edges to a sequence of
directional symbols drawn from a small alphabet. To encode the symbol sequence
using arithmetic coding, we compute an optimal variable-length context tree
(VCT) $\mathcal{T}$ via a maximum a posterior (MAP) formulation to estimate
symbols' conditional probabilities. MAP prevents us from overfitting given a
small training set $\mathcal{X}$ of past symbol sequences by identifying a VCT
$\mathcal{T}$ that achieves a high likelihood $P(\mathcal{X}|\mathcal{T})$ of
observing $\mathcal{X}$ given $\mathcal{T}$, and a large geometric prior
$P(\mathcal{T})$ stating that image contours are more often straight than
curvy. For the lossy case, we design efficient dynamic programming (DP)
algorithms that optimally trade off coding rate of an approximate contour
$\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ given a VCT $\mathcal{T}$ with two notions of distortion of
$\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ with respect to the original contour $\mathbf{x}$. To reduce
the size of the DP tables, a total suffix tree is derived from a given VCT
$\mathcal{T}$ for compact table entry indexing, reducing complexity.
Experimental results show that for lossless contour coding, our proposed
algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art context-based schemes consistently for
both small and large training datasets. For lossy contour coding, our
algorithms outperform comparable schemes in the literature in rate-distortion
performance.

 <dc:description>  We show a methodology for the computation of the probability of deadline miss
for a periodic real-time task scheduled by a resource reservation algorithm. We
propose a modelling technique for the system that reduces the computation of
such a probability to that of the steady state probability of an infinite state
Discrete Time Markov Chain with a periodic structure. This structure is
exploited to develop an efficient numeric solution where different
accuracy/computation time trade-offs can be obtained by operating on the
granularity of the model. More importantly we offer a closed form conservative
bound for the probability of a deadline miss. Our experiments reveal that the
bound remains reasonably close to the experimental probability in one real-time
application of practical interest. When this bound is used for the optimisation
of the overall Quality of Service for a set of tasks sharing the CPU, it
produces a good sub-optimal solution in a small amount of time.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is the detection of salient areas in natural video
by using the new deep learning techniques. Salient patches in video frames are
predicted first. Then the predicted visual fixation maps are built upon them.
We design the deep architecture on the basis of CaffeNet implemented with Caffe
toolkit. We show that changing the way of data selection for optimisation of
network parameters, we can save computation cost up to 12 times. We extend deep
learning approaches for saliency prediction in still images with RGB values to
specificity of video using the sensitivity of the human visual system to
residual motion. Furthermore, we complete primary colour pixel values by
contrast features proposed in classical visual attention prediction models. The
experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets. The first is
IRCCYN video database containing 31 videos with an overall amount of 7300
frames and eye fixations of 37 subjects. The second one is HOLLYWOOD2 provided
2517 movie clips with the eye fixations of 19 subjects. On IRCYYN dataset, the
accuracy obtained is of 89.51%. On HOLLYWOOD2 dataset, results in prediction of
saliency of patches show the improvement up to 2% with regard to RGB use only.
The resulting accuracy of 76, 6% is obtained. The AUC metric in comparison of
predicted saliency maps with visual fixation maps shows the increase up to 16%
on a sample of video clips from this dataset.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work extends the existing MACE-style finite model finding approach to
multi-sorted first order logic. This existing approach iteratively assumes
increasing domain sizes and encodes the related ground problem as a SAT
problem. When moving to the multi-sorted setting each sort may have a different
domain size, leading to an explosion in the search space. This paper focusses
on methods to tame that search space. The key approach adds additional
information to the SAT encoding to suggest which domains should be grown.
Evaluation of an implementation of techniques in the Vampire theorem prover
shows that they dramatically reduce the search space and that this is an
effective approach to find finite models in multi-sorted first order logic.

 <dc:title>Reducing DRAM Latency at Low Cost by Exploiting Heterogeneity</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lee, Donghyuk</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In modern systems, DRAM-based main memory is significantly slower than the
processor. Consequently, processors spend a long time waiting to access data
from main memory, making the long main memory access latency one of the most
critical bottlenecks to achieving high system performance. Unfortunately, the
latency of DRAM has remained almost constant in the past decade. This is mainly
because DRAM has been optimized for cost-per-bit, rather than access latency.
As a result, DRAM latency is not reducing with technology scaling, and
continues to be an important performance bottleneck in modern and future
systems.
  This dissertation seeks to achieve low latency DRAM-based memory systems at
low cost in three major directions. First, based on the observation that long
bitlines in DRAM are one of the dominant sources of DRAM latency, we propose a
new DRAM architecture, Tiered-Latency DRAM (TL-DRAM), which divides the long
bitline into two shorter segments using an isolation transistor, allowing one
segment to be accessed with reduced latency. Second, we propose a fine-grained
DRAM latency reduction mechanism, Adaptive-Latency DRAM, which optimizes DRAM
latency for the common operating conditions for individual DRAM module. Third,
we propose a new technique, Architectural-Variation-Aware DRAM (AVA-DRAM),
which reduces DRAM latency at low cost, by profiling and identifying only the
inherently slower regions in DRAM to dynamically determine the lowest latency
DRAM can operate at without causing failures.
  This dissertation provides a detailed analysis of DRAM latency by using both
circuit-level simulation with a detailed DRAM model and FPGA-based profiling of
real DRAM modules. Our latency analysis shows that our low latency DRAM
mechanisms enable significant latency reductions, leading to large improvement
in both system performance and energy efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Modern saturation-based Automated Theorem Provers typically implement the
superposition calculus for reasoning about first-order logic with or without
equality. Practical implementations of this calculus use a variety of literal
selections and term orderings to tame the growth of the search space and help
steer proof search. This paper introduces the notion of lookahead selection
that estimates (looks ahead) the effect on the search space of selecting a
literal. There is also a case made for the use of incomplete selection
functions that attempt to restrict the search space instead of satisfying some
completeness criteria. Experimental evaluation in the \Vampire\ theorem prover
shows that both lookahead selection and incomplete selection significantly
contribute to solving hard problems unsolvable by other methods.

 <dc:description>  We examine the existing Resolution systems for quantified Boolean formulas
(QBF) and answer the question which of these calculi can be lifted to the more
powerful Dependency QBFs (DQBF). An interesting picture emerges: While for QBF
we have the strict chain of proof systems Q-Resolution &lt; IR-calc &lt; IRM-calc,
the situation is quite different in DQBF. Q-Resolution and likewise universal
Resolution are too weak: they are not complete. IR-calc has the right strength:
it is sound and complete. IRM-calc is too strong: it is not sound any more, and
the same applies to long-distance Resolution. Conceptually, we use the relation
of DQBF to EPR and explain our new DQBF calculus based on IR-calc as a
subsystem of FO-Resolution.

 <dc:description>  Based on a modified version of Abramov-Petkov\v{s}ek reduction, a new
algorithm to compute minimal telescopers for bivariate hypergeometric terms was
developed last year. We investigate further in this paper and present a new
argument for the termination of this algorithm, which provides an independent
proof of the existence of telescopers and even enables us to derive lower as
well as upper bounds for the order of telescopers for hypergeometric terms.
Compared to the known bounds in the literature, our bounds are sometimes
better, and never worse than the known ones.

 <dc:title>On the Vulnerability of Digital Fingerprinting Systems to Finite
  Alphabet Collusion Attacks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a novel, non-linear collusion attack on digital
fingerprinting systems. The attack is proposed for fingerprinting systems with
finite alphabet but can be extended to continuous alphabet. We analyze the
error probability of the attack for some classes of proposed random and
deterministic schemes and obtain a bound on the number of colluders necessary
to correctly estimate the host signal. That is, it requires fewer number of
colluders to defeat the fingerprinting scheme. Our simulation results show that
our attack is more powerful in practice than predicted by the theoretical
bound.

 <dc:description>  Influential users play an important role in online social networks since
users tend to have an impact on one other. Therefore, the proposed work
analyzes users and their behavior in order to identify influential users and
predict user participation. Normally, the success of a social media site is
dependent on the activity level of the participating users. For both online
social networking sites and individual users, it is of interest to find out if
a topic will be interesting or not. In this article, we propose association
learning to detect relationships between users. In order to verify the
findings, several experiments were executed based on social network analysis,
in which the most influential users identified from association rule learning
were compared to the results from Degree Centrality and Page Rank Centrality.
The results clearly indicate that it is possible to identify the most
influential users using association rule learning. In addition, the results
also indicate a lower execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Localizing a radiant source is a widespread problem to many scientific and
technological research areas. E.g. localization based on range measurements
stays at the core of technologies like radar, sonar and wireless sensors
networks. In this manuscript we study in depth the model for source
localization based on range measurements obtained from the source signal, from
the point of view of algebraic geometry. In the case of three receivers, we
find unexpected connections between this problem and the geometry of Kummer's
and Cayley's surfaces. Our work gives new insights also on the localization
based on range differences.

 <dc:description>  This document describes the R package UBL that allows the use of several
methods for handling utility-based learning problems. Classification and
regression problems that assume non-uniform costs and/or benefits pose serious
challenges to predictive analytic tasks. In the context of meteorology,
finance, medicine, ecology, among many other, specific domain information
concerning the preference bias of the users must be taken into account to
enhance the models predictive performance. To deal with this problem, a large
number of techniques was proposed by the research community for both
classification and regression tasks. The main goal of UBL package is to
facilitate the utility-based predictive analytic task by providing a set of
methods to deal with this type of problems in the R environment. It is a
versatile tool that provides mechanisms to handle both regression and
classification (binary and multiclass) tasks. Moreover, UBL package allows the
user to specify his domain preferences, but it also provides some automatic
methods that try to infer those preference bias from the domain, considering
some common known settings.

 <dc:description>  Arguments about correctness of a concurrent data structure are typically
carried out by using the notion of linearizability and specifying the
linearization points of the data structure's procedures. Such arguments are
often cumbersome as the linearization points' position in time can be dynamic
(depend on the interference, run-time values and events from the past, or even
future), non-local (appear in procedures other than the one considered), and
whose position in the execution trace may only be determined after the
considered procedure has already terminated.
  In this paper we propose a new method, based on a separation-style logic, for
reasoning about concurrent objects with such linearization points. We embrace
the dynamic nature of linearization points, and encode it as part of the data
structure's auxiliary state, so that it can be dynamically modified in place by
auxiliary code, as needed when some appropriate run-time event occurs. We name
the idea linking-in-time, because it reduces temporal reasoning to spatial
reasoning. For example, modifying a temporal position of a linearization point
can be modeled similarly to a pointer update in separation logic. Furthermore,
the auxiliary state provides a convenient way to concisely express the
properties essential for reasoning about clients of such concurrent objects. We
illustrate the method by verifying (mechanically in Coq) an intricate optimal
snapshot algorithm due to Jayanti, as well as some clients.

 <dc:description>  We provide an analytical framework for balanced realization model order
reduction of linear control systems which depend on an unknown parameter.
Besides recovering known results for the first order corrections, we obtain
explicit novel expressions for the form of second order corrections for
singular values and singular vectors. The final result of our procedure is an
order reduced model which incorporates the uncertain parameter. We apply our
algorithm to the model order reduction of a linear system of masses and springs
with parameter dependent coefficients.

 <dc:description>  The objective of this paper is to provide consistent, real-time 3D
localization capabilities to mobile devices navigating within previously mapped
areas. To this end, we introduce the Cholesky-Schmidt-Kalman filter (C-SKF),
which explicitly considers the uncertainty of the prior map, by employing the
sparse Cholesky factor of the map's Hessian, instead of its dense
covariance--as is the case for the Schmidt-Kalman filter (SKF). By doing so,
the C-SKF has memory requirements typically linear in the size of the map, as
opposed to quadratic for storing the map's covariance. Moreover, and in order
to bound the processing needs of the C-SKF (between linear and quadratic in the
size of the map), we introduce a relaxation of the C-SKF algorithm, the sC-SKF,
which operates on the Cholesky factors of independent sub-maps resulting from
dividing the trajectory and observations used for constructing the map into
overlapping segments. Lastly, we assess the processing and memory requirements
of the proposed C-SKF and sC-SKF algorithms, and compare their positioning
accuracy against other approximate map-based localization approaches that
employ measurement-noise-covariance inflation to compensate for the map's
uncertainty.

 <dc:description>  This paper attacks the challenging problem of violence detection in videos.
Different from existing works focusing on combining multi-modal features, we go
one step further by adding and exploiting subclasses visually related to
violence. We enrich the MediaEval 2015 violence dataset by \emph{manually}
labeling violence videos with respect to the subclasses. Such fine-grained
annotations not only help understand what have impeded previous efforts on
learning to fuse the multi-modal features, but also enhance the generalization
ability of the learned fusion to novel test data. The new subclass based
solution, with AP of 0.303 and P100 of 0.55 on the MediaEval 2015 test set,
outperforms several state-of-the-art alternatives. Notice that our solution
does not require fine-grained annotations on the test set, so it can be
directly applied on novel and fully unlabeled videos. Interestingly, our study
shows that motion related features, though being essential part in previous
systems, are dispensable.

combines phonetic knowledge such as vowels with acoustic information to build
Guassian Mixture Model (GMM) classifier with Perceptual Linear Predictive (PLP)
features, optimized by Hetroscedastic Linear Discriminant Analysis (HLDA). With
input about 20-second accented speech, this system achieves classification rate
of 51% on a 7-way classification system focusing on the major types of accents
in English, which is competitive to the state-of-the-art results in this field.

 <dc:description>  A major challenge for building statistical models in the big data era is that
the available data volume may exceed the computational capability. A common
approach to solve this problem is to employ a subsampled dataset that can be
handled by the available computational resources. In this paper, we propose a
general subsampling scheme for large-scale multi-class logistic regression, and
examine the variance of the resulting estimator. We show that asymptotically,
the proposed method always achieves a smaller variance than that of the uniform
random sampling. Moreover, when the classes are conditional imbalanced,
significant improvement over uniform sampling can be achieved. Empirical
performance of the proposed method is compared to other methods on both
simulated and real-world datasets, and these results match and confirm our
theoretical analysis.

 <dc:description>  Arikan has shown that systematic polar codes (SPC) outperform nonsystematic
polar codes (NSPC). However, the performance gain comes at the price of
elevated encoding complexity, i.e., compared to NSPC, the available encoding
methods for SPC require higher memory and computation. In this letter, we
propose an efficient encoding algorithm requiring only $N$ bits of memory and
having $\frac{N}{2}\log_2N$ XOR operations. Moreover, the auxiliary variables
in the algorithm can share the memory to reduce extra memory requirement.
Furthermore, a parallel 2-bit encoding algorithm is also presented to improve
the encoding throughput. Remarkably, we show that parallel encoding can be
implemented with the same number of XOR operations and memory bits. Finally,
the proposed encoding algorithm can be directly used for NSPC with the same
complexity.

 <dc:title>Extracting Temporal and Causal Relations between Events</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mirza, Paramita</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Structured information resulting from temporal information processing is
crucial for a variety of natural language processing tasks, for instance to
generate timeline summarization of events from news documents, or to answer
temporal/causal-related questions about some events. In this thesis we present
a framework for an integrated temporal and causal relation extraction system.
We first develop a robust extraction component for each type of relations, i.e.
temporal order and causality. We then combine the two extraction components
into an integrated relation extraction system, CATENA---CAusal and Temporal
relation Extraction from NAtural language texts---, by utilizing the
presumption about event precedence in causality, that causing events must
happened BEFORE resulting events. Several resources and techniques to improve
our relation extraction systems are also discussed, including word embeddings
and training data expansion. Finally, we report our adaptation efforts of
temporal information processing for languages other than English, namely
Italian and Indonesian.

 <dc:description>  We make progress on some questions related to polynomial approximations of
${\rm AC}^0$. It is known, by works of Tarui (Theoret. Comput. Sci. 1993) and
Beigel, Reingold, and Spielman (Proc. $6$th CCC, 1991), that any ${\rm AC}^0$
circuit of size $s$ and depth $d$ has an $\varepsilon$-error probabilistic
polynomial over the reals of degree $(\log (s/\varepsilon))^{O(d)}$. We improve
this upper bound to $(\log s)^{O(d)}\cdot \log(1/\varepsilon)$, which is much
better for small values of $\varepsilon$.
  We give an application of this result by using it to resolve a question posed
by Tal (ECCC 2014): we show that $(\log s)^{O(d)}\cdot
\log(1/\varepsilon)$-wise independence fools ${\rm AC}^0$, improving on Tal's
strengthening of Braverman's theorem (J. ACM, 2010) that $(\log
(s/\varepsilon))^{O(d)}$-wise independence fools ${\rm AC}^0$. Up to the
constant implicit in the $O(d)$, our result is tight. As far as we know, this
is the first PRG construction for ${\rm AC}^0$ that achieves optimal dependence
on the error $\varepsilon$.
  We also prove lower bounds on the best polynomial approximations to ${\rm
AC}^0$. We show that any polynomial approximating the ${\rm OR}$ function on
$n$ bits to a small constant error must have degree at least
$\widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{\log n})$. This result improves exponentially on a
recent lower bound demonstrated by Meka, Nguyen, and Vu (arXiv 2015).

 <dc:description>  In this paper we revisit hybrid analog-digital precoding systems with
emphasis on their modelling and radio-frequency (RF) losses, to realistically
evaluate their benefits in 5G system implementations. For this, we decompose
the analog beamforming networks (ABFN) as a bank of commonly used RF components
and formulate realistic model constraints based on their S-parameters.
Specifically, we concentrate on fully-connected ABFN (FC-ABFN) and Butler
networks for implementing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in the RF
domain. The results presented in this paper reveal that the performance and
energy efficiency of hybrid precoding systems are severely affected, once
practical factors are considered in the overall design. In this context, we
also show that Butler RF networks are capable of providing better performances
than FC-ABFN for systems with a large number of RF chains.

 <dc:description>  We consider a stochastic online problem where $n$ applicants arrive over
time, one per time step. Upon arrival of each applicant their cost per time
step is revealed, and we have to fix the duration of employment, starting
immediately. This decision is irrevocable, i.e., we can neither extend a
contract nor dismiss a candidate once hired. In every time step, at least one
candidate needs to be under contract, and our goal is to minimize the total
hiring cost, which is the sum of the applicants' costs multiplied with their
respective employment durations. We provide a competitive online algorithm for
the case that the applicants' costs are drawn independently from a known
distribution. Specifically, the algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of 2.965
for the case of uniform distributions. For this case, we give an analytical
lower bound of 2 and a computational lower bound of 2.148. We then adapt our
algorithm to stay competitive even in settings with one or more of the
following restrictions: (i) at most two applicants can be hired concurrently;
(ii) the distribution of the applicants' costs is unknown; (iii) the total
number $n$ of time steps is unknown. On the other hand, we show that concurrent
employment is a necessary feature of competitive algorithms by proving that no
algorithm has a competitive ratio better than $\Omega(\sqrt{n} / \log n)$ if
concurrent employment is forbidden.

 <dc:title>A Logarithmic Integrality Gap Bound for Directed Steiner Tree in

 <dc:description>  We demonstrate that the integrality gap of the natural cut-based LP
relaxation for the directed Steiner tree problem is $O(\log k)$ in
quasi-bipartite graphs with $k$ terminals. Such instances can be seen to
generalize set cover, so the integrality gap analysis is tight up to a constant
factor. A novel aspect of our approach is that we use the primal-dual method; a
technique that is rarely used in designing approximation algorithms for network
design problems in directed graphs.

 <dc:title>Collective Stochastic Discrete Choice Problems: A Min-LQG Game

 <dc:description>  We consider a class of dynamic collective choice models with social
interactions, whereby a large number of non-uniform agents have to individually
settle on one of multiple discrete alternative choices, with the relevance of
their would-be choices continuously impacted by noise and the unfolding group
behavior. This class of problems is modeled here as a so-called Min-LQG game,
i.e., a linear quadratic Gaussian dynamic and non-cooperative game, with an
additional combinatorial aspect in that it includes a final choice-related
minimization in its terminal cost. The presence of this minimization term is
key to enforcing some specific discrete choice by each individual agent. The
theory of mean field games is invoked to generate a class of decentralized
agent feedback control strategies which are then shown to converge to an exact
Nash equilibrium of the game as the number of players increases to infinity. A
key building block in our approach is an explicit solution to the problem of
computing the best response of a generic agent to some arbitrarily posited
smooth mean field trajectory. Ultimately, an agent is shown to face a
continuously revised discrete choice problem, where greedy choices dictated by
current conditions must be constantly balanced against the risk of the future
process noise upsetting the wisdom of such decisions.Even though an agent's
ultimately chosen alternative is random and dictated by its entire noise
history and initial state, the limiting infinite population macroscopic
behavior can still be predicted. It is shown that any Nash equilibrium of the
game is defined by an a priori computable probability matrix characterizing the
manner in which the agent population ultimately splits among the available
alternatives.

 <dc:title>On the mediation of program allocation in high-demand environments</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we challenge the widely accepted premise that, in order to
carry out a distributed computation, say on the cloud, users have to inform,
along with all the inputs that the algorithm in use requires, the number of
processors to be used. We discuss the complicated nature of deciding the value
of such parameter, should it be chosen optimally, and propose the alternative
scenario in which this choice is passed on to the server side for automatic
determination. We show that the allocation problem arising from this
alternative is NP-hard only weakly, being therefore solvable in
pseudo-polynomial time. In our proposal, one key component on which the
automatic determination of the number of processors is based is the cost model.
The one we use, which is being increasingly adopted in the wake of the
cloud-computing movement, posits that each single execution of a program is to
be subject to current circumstances on both user and server side, and as such
be priced independently of all others. Running through our proposal is thus a
critique of the established common sense that sizing a set of processors to
handle a submission to some provider is entirely up to the user.

 <dc:description>  Wide-field lensfree on-chip microscopy, which leverages holography principles
to capture interferometric light-field encodings without lenses, is an emerging
imaging modality with widespread interest given the large field-of-view
compared to lens-based techniques. In this study, we introduce the idea of
laser light-field fusion for lensfree on-chip phase contrast nanoscopy, where
interferometric laser light-field encodings acquired using an on-chip setup
with laser pulsations at different wavelengths are fused to produce marker-free
phase contrast images of superior quality with resolving power more than five
times below the pixel pitch of the sensor array and more than 40% beyond the
diffraction limit. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate, for the first time, a
wide-field lensfree on-chip instrument successfully detecting 300 nm particles,
resulting in a numerical aperture of 1.1, across a large field-of-view of
$\sim$ 30 mm$^2$ without any specialized or intricate sample preparation, or
the use of synthetic aperture- or shift-based techniques.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we re-evaluate the basic strategies for label correcting
algorithms for the multiobjective shortest path (MOSP) problem, i.e., node and
label selection. In contrast to common believe, we show that---when carefully
implemented---the node-selection strategy usually beats the label-selection
strategy. Moreover, we present a new pruning method which is easy to implement
and performs very well on real-world road networks. In this study, we test our
hypotheses on artificial MOSP instances from the literature with up to 15
objectives and real-world road networks with up to almost 160,000 nodes.

 <dc:title>Defining Concepts of Emotion: From Philosophy to Science</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Changqing</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper is motivated by a series of (related) questions as to whether a
computer can have pleasure and pain, what pleasure (and intensity of pleasure)
is, and, ultimately, what concepts of emotion are.
  To determine what an emotion is, is a matter of conceptualization, namely,
understanding and explicitly encoding the concept of emotion as people use it
in everyday life. This is a notoriously difficult problem (Frijda, 1986, Fehr
\&amp; Russell, 1984). This paper firstly shows why this is a difficult problem by
aligning it with the conceptualization of a few other so called semantic
primitives such as &quot;EXIST&quot;, &quot;FORCE&quot;, &quot;BIG&quot; (plus &quot;LIMIT&quot;). The definitions of
these thought-to-be-indefinable concepts, given in this paper, show what formal
definitions of concepts look like and how concepts are constructed. As a
by-product, owing to the explicit account of the meaning of &quot;exist&quot;, the famous
dispute between Einstein and Bohr is naturally resolved from linguistic point
of view. Secondly, defending Frijda's view that emotion is action tendency (or
Ryle's behavioral disposition (propensity)), we give a list of emotions defined
in terms of action tendency. In particular, the definitions of pleasure and the
feeling of beauty are presented.
  Further, we give a formal definition of &quot;action tendency&quot;, from which the
concept of &quot;intensity&quot; of emotions (including pleasure) is naturally derived in
a formal fashion. The meanings of &quot;wish&quot;, &quot;wait&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;hot&quot; are analyzed.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we combine one method for hierarchical reinforcement learning -
the options framework - with deep Q-networks (DQNs) through the use of
different &quot;option heads&quot; on the policy network, and a supervisory network for
choosing between the different options. We utilise our setup to investigate the
effects of architectural constraints in subtasks with positive and negative
transfer, across a range of network capacities. We empirically show that our
augmented DQN has lower sample complexity when simultaneously learning subtasks
with negative transfer, without degrading performance when learning subtasks
with positive transfer.

 <dc:description>  English language requirements are often used to specify the behavior of
complex cyber-physical systems. The process of transforming these requirements
to a formal specification language is often challenging, especially if the
specification language does not contain constructs analogous to those used in
the original requirements. For example, requirements often contain real-time
constraints, but many specification languages for model checkers have discrete
time semantics. Work in specification patterns helps to bridge these gaps,
allowing straightforward expression of common requirements patterns in formal
languages. In this work we demonstrate how we support real-time specification
patterns in the Assume Guarantee Reasoning Environment (AGREE) using observers.
We demonstrate that there are subtle challenges, not mentioned in previous
literature, to express real-time patterns accurately using observers. We then
demonstrate that these patterns are sufficient to model real-time requirements
for a real-world avionics system.

 <dc:description>  This article presents a signature-free distributed algorithm which builds an
atomic read/write shared memory on top of an $n$-process asynchronous
message-passing system in which up to $t&lt;n/3$ processes may commit Byzantine
failures. From a conceptual point of view, this algorithm is designed to be as
close as possible to the algorithm proposed by Attiya, Bar-Noy and Dolev (JACM
1995), which builds an atomic register in an $n$-process asynchronous
message-passing system where up to $t&lt;n/2$ processes may crash. The proposed
algorithm is particularly simple. It does not use cryptography to cope with
Byzantine processes, and is optimal from a $t$-resilience point of view
($t&lt;n/3$). A read operation requires $O(n)$ messages, and a write operation
requires $O(n^2)$ messages.

 <dc:title>Understanding Human-Centric Images: From Geometry to Fashion</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Simo-Serra, Edgar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Understanding humans from photographs has always been a fundamental goal of
computer vision. In this thesis we have developed a hierarchy of tools that
cover a wide range of topics with the objective of understanding humans from
monocular RGB image: from low level feature point descriptors to high level
fashion-aware conditional random fields models. In order to build these high
level models it is paramount to have a battery of robust and reliable low and
mid level cues. Along these lines, we have proposed two low-level keypoint
descriptors: one based on the theory of the heat diffusion on images, and the
other that uses a convolutional neural network to learn discriminative image
patch representations. We also introduce distinct low-level generative models
for representing human pose: in particular we present a discrete model based on
a directed acyclic graph and a continuous model that consists of poses
clustered on a Riemannian manifold. As mid level cues we propose two 3D human
pose estimation algorithms: one that estimates the 3D pose given a noisy 2D
estimation, and an approach that simultaneously estimates both the 2D and 3D
pose. Finally, we formulate higher level models built upon low and mid level
cues for understanding humans from single images. Concretely, we focus on two
different tasks in the context of fashion: semantic segmentation of clothing,
and predicting the fashionability from images with metadata to ultimately
provide fashion advice to the user. For all presented approaches we present
extensive results and comparisons against the state-of-the-art and show
significant improvements on the entire variety of tasks we tackle.

 <dc:description>  A multidimensional financial system could provide benefits for individuals,
companies, and states. Instead of top-down control, which is destined to
eventually fail in a hyperconnected world, a bottom-up creation of value can
unleash creative potential and drive innovations. Multiple currency dimensions
can represent different externalities and thus enable the design of incentives
and feedback mechanisms that foster the ability of complex dynamical systems to
self-organize and lead to a more resilient society and sustainable economy.
Modern information and communication technologies play a crucial role in this
process, as Web 2.0 and online social networks promote cooperation and
collaboration on unprecedented scales. Within this contribution, we discuss how
one dimension of a multidimensional currency system could represent
socio-digital capital (Social Bitcoins) that can be generated in a bottom-up
way by individuals who perform search and navigation tasks in a future version
of the digital world. The incentive to mine Social Bitcoins could sustain
digital diversity, which mitigates the risk of totalitarian control by powerful
monopolies of information and can create new business opportunities needed in
times where a large fraction of current jobs is estimated to disappear due to
computerisation.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Influence Maximization in Social Networks: Why Commit when You
  can Adapt?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vaswani, Sharan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Most previous work on influence maximization in social networks is limited to
the non-adaptive setting in which the marketer is supposed to select all of the
seed users, to give free samples or discounts to, up front. A disadvantage of
this setting is that the marketer is forced to select all the seeds based
solely on a diffusion model. If some of the selected seeds do not perform well,
there is no opportunity to course-correct. A more practical setting is the
adaptive setting in which the marketer initially selects a batch of users and
observes how well seeding those users leads to a diffusion of product
adoptions. Based on this market feedback, she formulates a policy for choosing
the remaining seeds. In this paper, we study adaptive offline strategies for
two problems: (a) MAXSPREAD -- given a budget on number of seeds and a time
horizon, maximize the spread of influence and (b) MINTSS -- given a time
horizon and an expected number of target users to be influenced, minimize the
number of seeds that will be required. In particular, we present theoretical
bounds and empirical results for an adaptive strategy and quantify its
practical benefit over the non-adaptive strategy. We evaluate adaptive and
non-adaptive policies on three real data sets. We conclude that while benefit
of going adaptive for the MAXSPREAD problem is modest, adaptive policies lead
to significant savings for the MINTSS problem.

 <dc:title>Centralized Coded Caching for Heterogeneous Lossy Requests</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Centralized coded caching of popular contents is studied for users with
heterogeneous distortion requirements, corresponding to diverse processing and
display capabilities of mobile devices. Users' distortion requirements are
assumed to be fixed and known, while their particular demands are revealed only
after the placement phase. Modeling each file in the database as an independent
and identically distributed Gaussian vector, the minimum delivery rate that can
satisfy any demand combination within the corresponding distortion target is
studied. The optimal delivery rate is characterized for the special case of two
users and two files for any pair of distortion requirements. For the general
setting with multiple users and files, a layered caching and delivery scheme,
which exploits the successive refinability of Gaussian sources, is proposed.
This scheme caches each content in multiple layers, and it is optimized by
solving two subproblems: lossless caching of each layer with heterogeneous
cache capacities, and allocation of available caches among layers. The delivery
rate minimization problem for each layer is solved numerically, while two
schemes, called the proportional cache allocation (PCA) and ordered cache
allocation (OCA), are proposed for cache allocation. These schemes are compared
with each other and the cut-set bound through numerical simulations.

 <dc:description>  We establish a network formation game for the Internet's Autonomous System
(AS) interconnection topology. The game includes different types of players,
accounting for the heterogeneity of ASs in the Internet. In this network
formation game, the utility of a player depends on the network structure, e.g.,
the distances between nodes and the cost of links. We also consider the case
where utility (or monetary) transfers are allowed between the players. We
incorporate reliability considerations in the player's utility function, and
analyze static properties of the game as well as its dynamic evolution. We
provide dynamic analysis of topological quantities, and explain the prevalence
of some &quot;network motifs&quot; in the Internet graph. We assess our predictions with
real-world data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a graph-based nonlocal total variation method (NLTV) is
proposed for unsupervised classification of hyperspectral images (HSI). The
variational problem is solved by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG)
algorithm. By squaring the labeling function and using a stable simplex
clustering routine, an unsupervised clustering method with random
initialization can be implemented. The effectiveness of this proposed algorithm
is illustrated on both synthetic and real-world HSI, and numerical results show
that the proposed algorithm outperforms other standard unsupervised clustering
methods such as spherical K-means, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), and
the graph-based Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme.

 <dc:description>  Single-peakedness is one of the most important and well-known domain
restrictions on preferences. The computational study of single-peaked
electorates has largely been restricted to elections with tie-free votes, and
recent work that studies the computational complexity of manipulative attacks
for single-peaked elections for votes with ties has been restricted to
nonstandard models of single-peaked preferences for top orders. We study the
computational complexity of manipulation for votes with ties for the standard
model of single-peaked preferences and for single-plateaued preferences. We
show that these models avoid the anomalous complexity behavior exhibited by the
other models. We also state a surprising result on the relation between the
societal axis and the complexity of manipulation for single-peaked preferences.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops general space-efficient methods for error reduction for
unitary quantum computation. Consider a polynomial-time quantum computation
with completeness $c$ and soundness $s$, either with or without a witness
(corresponding to QMA and BQP, respectively). To convert this computation into
a new computation with error at most $2^{-p}$, the most space-efficient method
known requires extra workspace of ${O \bigl( p \log \frac{1}{c-s} \bigr)}$
qubits. This space requirement is too large for scenarios like
logarithmic-space quantum computations. This paper presents error-reduction
methods for unitary quantum computations (i.e., computations without
intermediate measurements) that require extra workspace of just ${O \bigl( \log
\frac{p}{c-s} \bigr)}$ qubits. This in particular gives the first methods of
strong amplification for logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations with
two-sided bounded error. This also leads to a number of consequences in
complexity theory, such as the uselessness of quantum witnesses in
bounded-error logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations, the PSPACE upper
bound for QMA with exponentially-small completeness-soundness gap, and strong
amplification for matchgate computations.

 <dc:description>  Background: In cognitive neuroscience the potential of Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) for solving complex classification tasks is yet to be fully exploited.
The most limiting factor is that DNNs as notorious 'black boxes' do not provide
insight into neurophysiological phenomena underlying a decision. Layer-wise
Relevance Propagation (LRP) has been introduced as a novel method to explain
individual network decisions. New Method: We propose the application of DNNs
with LRP for the first time for EEG data analysis. Through LRP the single-trial
DNN decisions are transformed into heatmaps indicating each data point's
relevance for the outcome of the decision. Results: DNN achieves classification
accuracies comparable to those of CSP-LDA. In subjects with low performance
subject-to-subject transfer of trained DNNs can improve the results. The
single-trial LRP heatmaps reveal neurophysiologically plausible patterns,
resembling CSP-derived scalp maps. Critically, while CSP patterns represent
class-wise aggregated information, LRP heatmaps pinpoint neural patterns to
single time points in single trials. Comparison with Existing Method(s): We
compare the classification performance of DNNs to that of linear CSP-LDA on two
data sets related to motor-imaginery BCI. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that
DNN is a powerful non-linear tool for EEG analysis. With LRP a new quality of
high-resolution assessment of neural activity can be reached. LRP is a
potential remedy for the lack of interpretability of DNNs that has limited
their utility in neuroscientific applications. The extreme specificity of the
LRP-derived heatmaps opens up new avenues for investigating neural activity
underlying complex perception or decision-related processes.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of amodal instance segmentation, the objective of
which is to predict the region encompassing both visible and occluded parts of
each object. Thus far, the lack of publicly available amodal segmentation
annotations has stymied the development of amodal segmentation methods. In this
paper, we sidestep this issue by relying solely on standard modal instance
segmentation annotations to train our model. The result is a new method for
amodal instance segmentation, which represents the first such method to the
best of our knowledge. We demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness both
qualitatively and quantitatively.

 <dc:description>  Modern computer vision is all about the possession of powerful image
representations. Deeper and deeper convolutional neural networks have been
built using larger and larger datasets and are made publicly available. A large
swath of computer vision scientists use these pre-trained networks with varying
degrees of successes in various tasks. Even though there is tremendous success
in copying these networks, the representational space is not learnt from the
target dataset in a traditional manner. One of the reasons for opting to use a
pre-trained network over a network learnt from scratch is that small datasets
provide less supervision and require meticulous regularization, smaller and
careful tweaking of learning rates to even achieve stable learning without
weight explosion. It is often the case that large deep networks are not
portable, which necessitates the ability to learn mid-sized networks from
scratch.
  In this article, we dive deeper into training these mid-sized networks on
small datasets from scratch by drawing additional supervision from a large
pre-trained network. Such learning also provides better generalization
accuracies than networks trained with common regularization techniques such as
l2, l1 and dropouts. We show that features learnt thus, are more general than
those learnt independently. We studied various characteristics of such networks
and found some interesting behaviors.

 <dc:description>  The influence of agents heterogeneity on the microscopic characteristics of
pedestrian flow is studied via an evacuation simulation tool based on the
Floor-Field model. The heterogeneity is introduced in agents velocity,
aggressiveness, and sensitivity to occupation. The simulation results are
compared to data gathered during an original experiment. The comparison shows
that the heterogeneity in aggressiveness and sensitivity occupation enables to

 <dc:description>  Logic-based abduction finds important applications in artificial intelligence
and related areas. One application example is in finding explanations for
observed phenomena. Propositional abduction is a restriction of abduction to
the propositional domain, and complexity-wise is in the second level of the
polynomial hierarchy. Recent work has shown that exploiting implicit hitting
sets and propositional satisfiability (SAT) solvers provides an efficient
approach for propositional abduction. This paper investigates this earlier work
and proposes a number of algorithmic improvements. These improvements are shown
to yield exponential reductions in the number of SAT solver calls. More
importantly, the experimental results show significant performance improvements
compared to the the best approaches for propositional abduction.

 <dc:title>When Can Helper Node Selection Improve Regenerating Codes? Part II: An
  Explicit Exact-Repair Code Construction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ahmad, Imad</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Chih-Chun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Part I of this work answered the following fundamental question: Under and
only under what (n,k,d) values does proactively choosing the helper nodes
improve the storage-bandwidth tradeoff of regenerating codes (RCs)? A critical
component of the achievability results in Part I is a low-complexity helper
selection solution, termed the family helper selection (FHS) scheme. In Part I,
FHS was proved to be optimal or weakly optimal (depending on the underlying
scenario) based on the assumption that as long as the minimum min-cut value of
FHS is no less than the file size, we can always find a distributed storage
code that can reconstruct the original file. This work relaxes this assumption
by providing an exact-repair code construction that attains the
minimum-bandwidth-regenerating (MBR) point of FHS, previously
calculated/predicted only by the min-cut analysis in Part I. As an outcome, for
the MBR points, FHS is indeed optimal or weakly optimal under various
scenarios.
  In addition to closing the loop of the graph-based study in Part I, the
proposed construction can also be viewed as a generalization of the existing
fractional repetition (FR) codes. FR codes are exact-repair codes that admit
the highly-desirable repair-by-transfer property. However, the unique
construction of FR codes limits its application to a restricted set of (n,k,d)
system parameters. In contrast, our new construction, termed the generalized FR
(GFR) codes, can be applied to arbitrary (n,k,d) values. Our GFR codes retain
most of the practical benefits of FR codes, i.e., being exact-repair and being
almost repairable-by-transfer.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Regenerating codes (RCs) can significantly reduce the repair-bandwidth of
distributed storage networks. Initially, the analysis of RCs was based on the
assumption that during the repair process, the newcomer does not distinguish
(among all surviving nodes) which nodes to access, i.e., the newcomer is
oblivious to the set of helpers being used. Such a scheme is termed the blind
helper selection (BHS) scheme. Nonetheless, it is intuitive in practice that
the newcomer should choose to access only those &quot;good&quot; helpers. In this
two-part paper, a new characterization of the effect of choosing the helper
nodes in terms of the storage-bandwidth tradeoff is given. Specifically, the
answer to the following fundamental question is provided: Under what condition
does proactively choosing the helper nodes improve the storage-bandwidth
tradeoff?
  Through a graph-based analysis, this Part I paper answers this question by
providing a necessary and sufficient condition under which optimally choosing
good helpers strictly improves the storage-bandwidth tradeoff. A low-complexity
helper selection solution, termed the family helper selection (FHS) scheme, is
proposed and the corresponding storage/repair-bandwidth curve is characterized.
This Part I paper also proves that under some design parameters, the FHS scheme
is indeed optimal among all helper selection schemes. In the Part II paper, an
explicit construction of an exact-repair code is proposed that achieves the
minimum-bandwidth-regenerating (MBR) point of the FHS scheme. The new
exact-repair code can be viewed as a generalization of the existing fractional
repetition code.

 <dc:description>  Energy games belong to a class of turn-based two-player infinite-duration
games}played on a weighted directed graph. It is one of the rare and intriguing
combinatorial problems that lie in ${\sf NP} \cap {\sf co\mbox{-}NP}$, but are
not known to be in ${\sf P}$. The existence of polynomial-time algorithms has
been a major open problem for decades and apart from pseudopolynomial
algorithms there is no algorithm that solves any non-trivial subclass in
polynomial time.
  In this paper, we give several results based on the weight structures of the
graph. First, we identify a notion of penalty and present a polynomial-time
algorithm when the penalty is large. Our algorithm is the first polynomial-time
algorithm on a large class of weighted graphs. It includes several worst-case
instances on which previous algorithms, such as value iteration and random
facet algorithms, require at least sub-exponential time. Our main technique is
developing the first non-trivial approximation algorithm and showing how to
convert it to an exact algorithm. Moreover, we show that in a practical case in
verification where weights are clustered around a constant number of values,
the energy game problem can be solved in polynomial time. We also show that the
problem is still as hard as in general when the clique-width is bounded or the
graph is strongly ergodic, suggesting that restricting the graph structure does
not necessarily help.

 <dc:description>  Trilateration is one of the well-known threat models to the user's location
privacy in location-based apps, especially those contain highly sensitive
information such as dating apps. The threat model mainly bases on the publicly
shown distance from a targeted victim to the adversary to pinpoint the victim's
location. As a countermeasure, most of location-based apps have already
implemented the 'hide distance' function, or added noise to the publicly shown
distance in order to protect their user's location privacy. The effectiveness
of such approaches however is still questionable.

 <dc:description>  The increasing prevalence of Virtual Reality technologies as a platform for
gaming and video playback warrants research into how to best apply the current
state of the art to challenges in data visualization. Many current VR systems
are noncollaborative, while data analysis and visualization is often a
multi-person process. Our goal in this paper is to address the technical and
user experience challenges that arise when creating VR environments for
collaborative data visualization. We focus on the integration of multiple
tracking systems and the new interaction paradigms that this integration can
enable, along with visual design considerations that apply specifically to
collaborative network visualization in virtual reality. We demonstrate a system
for collaborative interaction with large 3D layouts of Twitter friend/follow
networks. The system is built by combining a 'Holojam' architecture (multiple
GearVR Headsets within an OptiTrack motion capture stage) and Perception Neuron
motion suits, to offer an untethered, full-room multi-person visualization
experience.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have witnessed several initiatives on enabling Internet access
to the next three billion people. Access to the Internet necessarily translates
to access to its services. This means that the goal of providing Internet
access requires ac- cess to its critical service infrastructure, which are
currently hosted in the cloud. However, recent works have pointed out that the
current cloud centric nature of the Internet is a fundamental barrier for
Internet access in rural/remote areas as well as in developing regions. It is
important to explore (low cost) solutions such as micro cloud infrastructures
that can provide services at the edge of the network (potentially on demand),
right near the users. In this paper, we present Cloudrone- a preliminary idea
of deploying a lightweight micro cloud infrastructure in the sky using
indigenously built low cost drones, single board computers and lightweight
Operating System virtualization technologies. Our paper lays out the
preliminary ideas on such a system that can be instantaneously deployed on
demand. We describe an initial design of the Cloudrone and provide a
preliminary evaluation of the proposed system mainly focussed on the
scalability issues of supporting multiple services and users.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a real time video based pointing method which allows
sketching and writing of English text over air in front of mobile camera.
Proposed method have two main tasks: first it track the colored finger tip in
the video frames and then apply English OCR over plotted images in order to
recognize the written characters. Moreover, proposed method provides a natural
human-system interaction in such way that it do not require keypad, stylus, pen
or glove etc for character input. For the experiments, we have developed an
application using OpenCv with JAVA language. We tested the proposed method on
Samsung Galaxy3 android mobile. Results show that proposed algorithm gains the
average accuracy of 92.083% when tested for different shaped alphabets. Here,
more than 3000 different Magnetic 3D shaped characters were used [Ref:
http://learnrnd.com/news.php?id=Magnetic_3D_Bio_Printing]. Our proposed system
is the software based approach and relevantly very simple, fast and easy. It
does not require sensors or any hardware rather than camera and red tape.
Moreover, proposed methodology can be applicable for all disconnected languages
but having one issue that it is color sensitive in such a way that existence of
any red color in the background before starting the character writing can lead
to false results.

 <dc:title>Abnormality Detection in Correlated Gaussian Molecular Nano-Networks:
  Design and Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ghavami, Siavash</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lahouti, Farshad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A nano abnormality detection scheme (NADS) in molecular nano-networks is
studied. This is motivated by the fact that early detection of diseases such as
cancer play a crucial role in their successful treatment. The proposed NADS is
in fact a two-tier network of sensor nano-machines (SNMs) in the first tier and
a data-gathering node (DGN) at the sink. The SNMs detect the presence of
competitor cells (abnormality) by variations in input and/or parameters of a
nano-communications channel (NCC). The noise of SNMs as their nature suggest is
considered correlated in time and space and herein assumed additive Gaussian.
In the second step, the SNMs transmit micro-scale messages over a noisy micro
communications channel (MCC) to the DGN, where a decision is made upon fusing
the received signals. We find an optimum design of detectors for each of the
NADS tiers based on the end-to-end NADS performance. The detection performance
of each SNM is analyzed by setting up a generalized likelihood ratio test.
Next, taking into account the effect of the MCC, the overall performance of the
NADS is analyzed in terms of probabilities of misdetection and false alarm. In
addition, computationally efficient expressions to quantify the NADS
performance is derived by providing respectively an approximation and an upper
bound for the probabilities of misdetection and false alarm. This in turn
enables formulating a design problem, where the optimized concentration of SNMs
in a sample is obtained for a high probability of detection and a limited
probability of false alarm. The results indicate that otherwise ignoring the
spatial and temporal correlation of SNM noise in the analysis, leads to an NADS
that noticeably underperforms in operations.

 <dc:title>Infinitary $\lambda$-Calculi from a Linear Perspective (Long Version)</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lago, Ugo Dal</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a linear infinitary $\lambda$-calculus, called
$\ell\Lambda_{\infty}$, in which two exponential modalities are available, the
first one being the usual, finitary one, the other being the only construct
interpreted coinductively. The obtained calculus embeds the infinitary
applicative $\lambda$-calculus and is universal for computations over infinite
strings. What is particularly interesting about $\ell\Lambda_{\infty}$, is that
the refinement induced by linear logic allows to restrict both modalities so as
to get calculi which are terminating inductively and productive coinductively.
We exemplify this idea by analysing a fragment of $\ell\Lambda$ built around
the principles of $\mathsf{SLL}$ and $\mathsf{4LL}$. Interestingly, it enjoys
confluence, contrarily to what happens in ordinary infinitary
$\lambda$-calculi.

 <dc:description>  We present a new self-regulating methodology for coordinating distributed
team work called Algorithmic Autoregulation (AA), based on recent social
networking concepts and individual merit. Team members take on an egalitarian
role, and stay voluntarily logged into so-called AA sessions for part of their
time (e.g. 2 hours per day), during which they create periodical logs - short
text sentences - they wish to share about their activity with the team. These
logs are publicly aggregated in a website and are peer-validated after the end
of a session, as in code review. A short screencast is ideally recorded at the
end of each session to make AA logs more understandable. This methodology has
shown to be well-suited for increasing the efficiency of distributed teams
working on Global Software Development (GSD), as observed in our reported
experience in actual real-world situations. This efficiency boost is mainly
achieved through 1) built-in asynchronous on-demand communication in
conjunction with documentation of work, products, and processes, and 2) reduced
need for central management, meetings or time-consuming reports. Hence, the AA
methodology legitimizes and facilitates the activities of a distributed
software team. It thus enables other entities to have a solid means to fund
these activities, allowing for new and concrete business models to emerge for
very distributed software development. AA has been proposed, at its core, as a
way of sustaining self-replicating hacker initiatives. These claims are
discussed in a real case-study of running a distributed free software hacker
team called Lab Macambira.

 <dc:description>  The field of multiple view geometry has seen tremendous progress in
reconstruction and calibration due to methods for extracting reliable point
features and key developments in projective geometry. Point features, however,
are not available in certain applications and result in unstructured point
cloud reconstructions. General image curves provide a complementary feature
when keypoints are scarce, and result in 3D curve geometry, but face challenges
not addressed by the usual projective geometry of points and algebraic curves.
We address these challenges by laying the theoretical foundations of a
framework based on the differential geometry of general curves, including
stationary curves, occluding contours, and non-rigid curves, aiming at stereo
correspondence, camera estimation (including calibration, pose, and multiview
epipolar geometry), and 3D reconstruction given measured image curves. By
gathering previous results into a cohesive theory, novel results were made
possible, yielding three contributions. First we derive the differential
geometry of an image curve (tangent, curvature, curvature derivative) from that
of the underlying space curve (tangent, curvature, curvature derivative,
torsion). Second, we derive the differential geometry of a space curve from
that of two corresponding image curves. Third, the differential motion of an
image curve is derived from camera motion and the differential geometry and
motion of the space curve. The availability of such a theory enables novel
curve-based multiview reconstruction and camera estimation systems to augment
existing point-based approaches. This theory has been used to reconstruct a &quot;3D
curve sketch&quot;, to determine camera pose from local curve geometry, and
tracking; other developments are underway.

 <dc:description>  An optimal scheduling model for a microgrid participating in the electricity
distribution market in interaction with a Distribution Market Operator (DMO) is
proposed in this paper. The DMO administers the established electricity market
in the distribution level, sets electricity prices, determines the amount of
the power exchange among market participants, and interacts with the
Independent System Operator (ISO). Considering a predetermined main grid power
transfer to the microgrid, the microgrid scheduling problem will aim at
balancing the power supply and demand while taking financial objectives into
account. Numerical simulations exhibit the application and the effectiveness of
the proposed market-based microgrid scheduling model and further investigate
merits over a price-based scheme.

 <dc:description>  The formalism of quantum theory in Hilbert space has been applied with
success to the modeling and explanation of several cognitive phenomena, whereas
traditional cognitive approaches were problematical. However, this 'quantum
cognition paradigm' was recently challenged by its proven impossibility to
simultaneously model 'question order effects' and 'response replicability'. In
Part I of this paper we describe sequential dichotomic measurements within an
operational and realistic framework for human cognition elaborated by
ourselves, and represent them in a quantum-like 'extended Bloch representation'
where the Born rule of quantum probability does not necessarily hold. In Part
II we apply this mathematical framework to successfully model question order
effects, response replicability and unpacking effects, thus opening the way
toward quantum cognition beyond Hilbert space.

 <dc:description>  The accuracy of information retrieval systems is often measured using complex
loss functions such as the average precision (AP) or the normalized discounted
cumulative gain (NDCG). Given a set of positive (relevant) and negative
(non-relevant) samples, the parameters of a retrieval system can be estimated
by minimizing these loss functions. However, the non-differentiability and
non-decomposability of these loss functions does not allow for simple gradient
based optimization algorithms. This issue is generally circumvented by either
optimizing a structured hinge-loss upper bound to the loss function or by using
asymptotic methods like the direct-loss minimization framework. Yet, the high
computational complexity of loss-augmented inference, which is necessary for
both the frameworks, prohibits its use in large training data sets. To
alleviate this deficiency, we present a novel quicksort flavored algorithm for
a large class of non-decomposable loss functions. We provide a complete
characterization of the loss functions that are amenable to our algorithm, and
show that it includes both AP and NDCG based loss functions. Furthermore, we
prove that no comparison based algorithm can improve upon the computational
complexity of our approach asymptotically. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in the context of optimizing the structured hinge loss upper bound
of AP and NDCG loss for learning models for a variety of vision tasks. Using
the CIFAR-10 data set and the PASCAL VOC action recognition and object
detection data sets, we show that our approach provides significantly better
results than simpler decomposable loss functions, while requiring a comparable
training time.

 <dc:description>  The research on human cognition has recently benefited from the use of the
mathematical formalism of quantum theory in Hilbert space. However, cognitive
situations exist which indicate that the Hilbert space structure, and the
associated Born rule, would be insufficient to provide a satisfactory modeling
of the collected data, so that one needs to go beyond Hilbert space. In Part I
of this paper we follow this direction and present a general tension-reduction
(GTR) model, in the ambit of an operational and realistic framework for human
cognition. In this Part II we apply this non-Hilbertian quantum-like model to
faithfully reproduce the probabilities of the 'Clinton/Gore' and 'Rose/Jackson'
experiments on question order effects. We also explain why the GTR-model is
needed if one wants to deal, in a fully consistent way, with response
replicability and unpacking effects.

 <dc:description>  Network virtualization has become a fundamental technology to deliver
services for emerging data-intensive applications in fields such as
bioinformatics and retail analytics hosted at multi-data center scales. To
create and maintain a successful virtual network service, the problem of
generating a constrained path manifests both in the management plane with a
physical path creation (chains of virtual network functions or virtual link
embedding) and in the data plane with on-demand path adaptation (traffic
steering with Service Level Objective (SLO) guarantees). In this paper, we
define the virtual path embedding problem to subsume the virtual link embedding
and the constrained traffic steering problems, and propose a new scheme to
solve it optimally. Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithm viz.,
&quot;Neighborhood Method&quot; (NM) which provides an on-demand path with SLO guarantees
while reducing expensive over provisioning. We show that by solving the Virtual
Path Embedding problem in a set of diverse topology scenarios we gain up to 20%
in network utilization, and up to 150% in energy efficiency, compared to the
existing path embedding solutions.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning models are frequently used to solve complex security
problems, as well as to make decisions in sensitive situations like guiding
autonomous vehicles or predicting financial market behaviors. Previous efforts
have shown that numerous machine learning models were vulnerable to adversarial
manipulations of their inputs taking the form of adversarial samples. Such
inputs are crafted by adding carefully selected perturbations to legitimate
inputs so as to force the machine learning model to misbehave, for instance by
outputting a wrong class if the machine learning task of interest is
classification. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, all previous work on
adversarial samples crafting for neural network considered models used to solve
classification tasks, most frequently in computer vision applications. In this
paper, we contribute to the field of adversarial machine learning by
investigating adversarial input sequences for recurrent neural networks
processing sequential data. We show that the classes of algorithms introduced
previously to craft adversarial samples misclassified by feed-forward neural
networks can be adapted to recurrent neural networks. In a experiment, we show
that adversaries can craft adversarial sequences misleading both categorical
and sequential recurrent neural networks.

 <dc:description>  Existing Real-Time Translation Interfaces (RTTI) do not provide experience as

both time and potential language context. In order to overcome the above

this will create extra free time for users. So we further propose to utilize
the free time for contextual language learning.

 <dc:description>  An underlying assumption in conventional multi-view learning algorithms is
that all views can be simultaneously accessed. However, due to various factors
when collecting and pre-processing data from different views, the streaming
view setting, in which views arrive in a streaming manner, is becoming more
common. By assuming that the subspaces of a multi-view model trained over past
views are stable, here we fine tune their combination weights such that the
well-trained multi-view model is compatible with new views. This largely
overcomes the burden of learning new view functions and updating past view
functions. We theoretically examine convergence issues and the influence of
streaming views in the proposed algorithm. Experimental results on real-world
datasets suggest that studying the streaming views problem in multi-view
learning is significant and that the proposed algorithm can effectively handle
streaming views in different applications.

 <dc:title>Index Modulation Techniques for 5G Wireless Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Basar, Ertugrul</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The increasing demand for higher data rates, better quality of service, fully
mobile and connected wireless networks lead the researchers to seek new
solutions beyond 4G wireless systems. It is anticipated that 5G wireless
networks, which are expected to be introduced around 2020, will achieve ten
times higher spectral and energy efficiency than current 4G wireless networks
and will support data rates up to 10 Gbps for low mobility users. The ambitious
goals set for 5G wireless networks require dramatic changes in the design of
different layers for next generation communications systems. Massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC)
modulation, relaying technologies, and millimeter-wave communications have been
considered as some of the strong candidates for the physical layer design of 5G
networks. In this article, we shed light on the potential and implementation of
index modulation (IM) techniques for MIMO and multi-carrier communications
systems which are expected to be two of the key technologies for 5G systems.
Specifically, we focus on two promising applications of IM: spatial modulation
(SM) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with IM (OFDM-IM), and we
discuss the recent advances and future research directions in IM technologies
towards spectral and energy-efficient 5G wireless networks.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a Iterative Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE)
detection for the uplink Multiuser Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO)
systems with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), in which all the users
interfere with each other both in the time domain and frequency domain. It is
well known that the Iterative LMMSE detection greatly reduces the system
computational complexity by departing the overall processing into many
low-complexity distributed calculations that can be executed in parallel.
However, it is generally considered to be suboptimal and achieves relatively
poor performance due to its sub-optimal detector. In this paper, we firstly
present the matching conditions and area theorems for the iterative detection
of the MIMO-NOMA systems. Based on the matching conditions and area theorems,
the achievable rate region of the Iterative LMMSE detection is analysed.
Interestingly, we prove that by properly design the Iterative LMMSE detection,
it can achieve (i) the optimal capacity of symmetric MIMO-NOMA system, (ii) the
optimal sum capacity of asymmetric MIMO-NOMA system, (iii) all the maximal
extreme points in the capacity region of asymmetric MIMO-NOMA system, (iv) the
whole capacity region of two-user and three-user asymmetric MIMO-NOMA systems,
in a distributed manner for all cases. Finally, a practical Iterative LMMSE
detection design is also proposed for the general asymmetric MIMO-NOMA systems.

 <dc:description>  This paper outlines the development and evaluation of a wearable haptic game
interface. The device differs from many traditional haptic feedback
implementation in that it combines vibrotactile feedback with gesture based
input, thus becoming a two way conduit between the user and the virtual
environment. The device is intended to challenge what is considered an
&quot;interface&quot; and sets out to purposefully blur the boundary between man and
machine. This allows for a more immersive experience, and a user evaluation
shows that the intuitive interface allows the user to become the aircraft that
is controlled by the movements of the user's hand.

 <dc:description>  For a simple (unbiased) random walk on a connected graph with $n$ vertices,
the cover time (the expected number of steps it takes to visit all vertices) is
at most $O(n^3)$. We consider locally biased random walks, in which the
probability of traversing an edge depends on the degrees of its endpoints. We
confirm a conjecture of Abdullah, Cooper and Draief [2015] that the min-degree
local bias rule ensures a cover time of $O(n^2)$. For this we formulate and
prove the following lemma about spanning trees.
  Let $R(e)$ denote for edge $e$ the minimum degree among its two endpoints. We
say that a weight function $W$ for the edges is feasible if it is nonnegative,
dominated by $R$ (for every edge $W(e) \le R(e)$) and the sum over all edges of
the ratios $W(e)/R(e)$ equals $n-1$. For example, in trees $W(e) = R(e)$, and
in regular graphs the sum of edge weights is $d(n-1)$.
  {\bf Lemma:} for every feasible $W$, the minimum weight spanning tree has
total weight $O(n)$.
  For regular graphs, a similar lemma was proved by Kahn, Linial, Nisan and
Saks [1989].

 <dc:description>  Server consolidation based on virtualization technology simplifies system
administration and improves energy efficiency by improving resource
utilizations and reducing the physical machine (PM) number in contemporary
service-oriented data centers. The elasticity of Internet applications changes
the consolidation technologies from addressing virtual machines (VMs) to PMs
mapping schemes which must know the VMs statuses, i.e. the number of VMs and
the profiling data of each VM, into providing the application-to-VM-to-PM
mapping. In this paper, we study on the consolidation of multiple Internet
applications, minimizing the number of PMs with required performance. We first
model the consolidation providing the application-to-VM-to-PM mapping to
minimize the number of PMs as an integer linear programming problem, and then
present a heuristic algorithm to solve the problem in polynomial time.
Extensive experimental results show that our heuristic algorithm consumes less
than 4.3% more resources than the optimal amounts with few overheads. Existing
consolidation technologies using the input of the VM statuses output by our
heuristic algorithm consume 1.06% more PMs.

 <dc:description>  Outsourcing jobs to a public cloud is a cost-effective way to address the
problem of satisfying the peak resource demand when the local cloud has
insufficient resources. In this paper, we study on managing
deadline-constrained bag-of-tasks jobs on hybrid clouds. We present a binary
nonlinear programming (BNP) problem to model the hybrid cloud management where
the utilization of physical machines (PMs) in the local cloud/cluster is
maximized when the local resources are enough to satisfy the deadline
constraints of jobs, while when not, the rent cost from the public cloud is
minimized. To solve this BNP problem in polynomial time, we proposed a
heuristic algorithm. Its main idea is assigning the task closest to its
deadline to current core until the core cannot finish any task within its
deadline. When there is no available core, the algorithm adds an available PM
with most capacity or rents a new VM with highest cost-performance ratio.
Extensive experimental results show that our heuristic algorithm saves
16.2%-76% rent cost and improves 47.3%-182.8% resource utilizations satisfying
deadline constraints, compared with first fit decreasing algorithm.

 <dc:title>An Autonomous Reactive Architecture for Efficient AUV Mission Time
  Management in Realistic Severe Ocean Environment</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Today AUVs operation still remains restricted to very particular tasks with
low real autonomy due to battery restrictions. Efficient motion planning and
mission scheduling are principle requirement toward advance autonomy and
facilitate the vehicle to handle long-range operations. A single vehicle cannot
carry out all tasks in a large scale terrain; hence, it needs a certain degree
of autonomy in performing robust decision making and awareness of the
mission/environment to trade-off between tasks to be completed, managing the
available time, and ensuring safe deployment at all stages of the mission. In
this respect, this research introduces a modular control architecture including
higher/lower level planners, in which the higher level module is responsible
for increasing mission productivity by assigning prioritized tasks while
guiding the vehicle toward its final destination in a terrain covered by
several waypoints; and the lower level is responsible for vehicle's safe
deployment in a smaller scale encountering time-varying ocean current and
different uncertain static/moving obstacles similar to actual ocean
environment. Synchronization between higher and lower level modules is
efficiently configured to manage the mission time and to guarantee on-time
termination of the mission. The performance and accuracy of two higher and
lower level modules are tested and validated using ant colony and firefly
optimization algorithm, respectively. After all, the overall performance of the
architecture is investigated in 10 different mission scenarios. The analyze of
the captured results from different simulated missions confirm the efficiency
and inherent robustness of the introduced architecture in efficient time
management, safe deployment, and providing beneficial operation by proper
prioritizing the tasks in accordance with mission time.

 <dc:description>  Given a graph where vertices are partitioned into $k$ terminals and
non-terminals, the goal is to compress the graph (i.e., reduce the number of
non-terminals) using minor operations while preserving terminal distances
approximately.The distortion of a compressed graph is the maximum
multiplicative blow-up of distances between all pairs of terminals. We study
the trade-off between the number of non-terminals and the distortion. This
problem generalizes the Steiner Point Removal (SPR) problem, in which all
non-terminals must be removed.
  We introduce a novel black-box reduction to convert any lower bound on
distortion for the SPR problem into a super-linear lower bound on the number of
non-terminals, with the same distortion, for our problem. This allows us to
show that there exist graphs such that every minor with distortion less than
$2~/~2.5~/~3$ must have $\Omega(k^2)~/~\Omega(k^{5/4})~/~\Omega(k^{6/5})$
non-terminals, plus more trade-offs in between. The black-box reduction has an
interesting consequence: if the tight lower bound on distortion for the SPR
problem is super-constant, then allowing any $O(k)$ non-terminals will not help
improving the lower bound to a constant.
  We also build on the existing results on spanners, distance oracles and
connected 0-extensions to show a number of upper bounds for general graphs,
planar graphs, graphs that exclude a fixed minor and bounded treewidth graphs.
Among others, we show that any graph admits a minor with $O(\log k)$ distortion
and $O(k^{2})$ non-terminals, and any planar graph admits a minor with
$1+\varepsilon$ distortion and $\widetilde{O}((k/\varepsilon)^{2})$
non-terminals.

 <dc:description>  $\alpha$Check is a light-weight property-based testing tool built on top of
$\alpha$Prolog, a logic programming language based on nominal logic.
$\alpha$Prolog is particularly suited to the validation of the meta-theory of
formal systems, for example correctness of compiler translations involving
name-binding, alpha-equivalence and capture-avoiding substitution. In this
paper we describe an alternative to the negation elimination algorithm
underlying $\alpha$Check that substantially improves its effectiveness. To
substantiate this claim we compare the checker performances w.r.t. two of its
main competitors in the logical framework niche, namely the QuickCheck/Nitpick
combination offered by Isabelle/HOL and the random testing facility in
PLT-Redex.

 <dc:description>  We introduce two new operations (compositional products and implication) on
Weihrauch degrees, and investigate the overall algebraic structure. The
validity of the various distributivity laws is studied and forms the basis for
a comparison with similar structures such as residuated lattices and concurrent
Kleene algebras. Introducing the notion of an ideal with respect to the
compositional product, we can consider suitable quotients of the Weihrauch
degrees. We also prove some specific characterizations using the implication.
In order to introduce and study compositional products and implications, we
introduce and study a function space of multi-valued continuous functions. This
space turns out to be particularly well-behaved for effectively traceable
spaces that are closely related to admissibly represented spaces.

 <dc:description>  Offline handwriting recognition systems require cropped text line images for
both training and recognition. On the one hand, the annotation of position and
transcript at line level is costly to obtain. On the other hand, automatic line
segmentation algorithms are prone to errors, compromising the subsequent
recognition. In this paper, we propose a modification of the popular and
efficient multi-dimensional long short-term memory recurrent neural networks
(MDLSTM-RNNs) to enable end-to-end processing of handwritten paragraphs. More
particularly, we replace the collapse layer transforming the two-dimensional
representation into a sequence of predictions by a recurrent version which can
recognize one line at a time. In the proposed model, a neural network performs
a kind of implicit line segmentation by computing attention weights on the
image representation. The experiments on paragraphs of Rimes and IAM database
yield results that are competitive with those of networks trained at line
level, and constitute a significant step towards end-to-end transcription of
full documents.

critical management issues, such as the discovery of SF instances close to IP

large cloud networks, where SFs may be moved or replicated, and in the emerging

the distributed off-path signaling protocol (OSP). We show the protocol
functions and demonstrate its scalability and effectiveness by experimental
results.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, more and more RDF data is becoming available on the Semantic Web.
While the Semantic Web is generally incomplete by nature, on certain topics, it
already contains complete information and thus, queries may return all answers
that exist in reality. In this paper we develop a technique to check query
completeness based on RDF data annotated with completeness information, taking
into account data-specific inferences that lead to an inference problem which
is $\Pi^P_2$-complete. We then identify a practically relevant fragment of
completeness information, suitable for crowdsourced, entity-centric RDF data
sources such as Wikidata, for which we develop an indexing technique that
allows to scale completeness reasoning to Wikidata-scale data sources. We
verify the applicability of our framework using Wikidata and develop COOL-WD, a
completeness tool for Wikidata, used to annotate Wikidata with completeness
statements and reason about the completeness of query answers over Wikidata.
The tool is available at http://cool-wd.inf.unibz.it/.

 <dc:description>  In the private values single object auction model, we construct a
satisfactory mechanism - a symmetric, dominant strategy incentive compatible,
and budget-balanced mechanism. Our mechanism allocates the object to the
highest valued agent with more than 99% probability provided there are at least
14 agents. It is also ex-post individually rational. We show that our mechanism
is optimal in a restricted class of satisfactory ranking mechanisms. Since
achieving efficiency through a dominant strategy incentive compatible and
budget-balanced mechanism is impossible in this model, our results illustrate
the limits of this impossibility.

 <dc:description>  Consider a distributed network on a finite simple graph $G=(V,E)$ with
diameter $d$ and maximum degree $\Delta$, where each node has a phase
oscillator revolving on $S^{1}=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ with unit speed.
Pulse-coupling is a class of distributed time evolution rule for such networked
phase oscillators inspired by biological oscillators, which depends only upon
event-triggered local pulse communications. In this paper, we propose a novel
inhibitory pulse-coupling and prove that arbitrary phase configuration on $G$
synchronizes by time $51d$ if $G$ is a tree and $\Delta \le 3$. We extend this
pulse-coupling by letting each oscillator throttle the input according to an
auxiliary state variable. We show that the resulting adaptive pulse-coupling
synchronizes arbitrary initial configuration on $G$ by time $83d$ if $G$ is a
tree. As an application, we obtain a universal randomized distributed clock
synchronization algorithm, which uses $O(\log \Delta)$ memory per node and
converges on any $G$ with expected worst case running time of
$O(|V|+(d^{5}+\Delta^{2})\log |V|)$.

 <dc:description>  Direct load control of a heterogeneous cluster of residential demand
flexibility sources is a high-dimensional control problem with partial
observability. This work proposes a novel approach that uses a convolutional
neural network to extract hidden state-time features to mitigate the curse of
partial observability. More specific, a convolutional neural network is used as
a function approximator to estimate the state-action value function or
Q-function in the supervised learning step of fitted Q-iteration. The approach
is evaluated in a qualitative simulation, comprising a cluster of
thermostatically controlled loads that only share their air temperature, whilst
their envelope temperature remains hidden. The simulation results show that the
presented approach is able to capture the underlying hidden features and
successfully reduce the electricity cost the cluster.

 <dc:description>  In the lambda calculus a term is solvable iff it is operationally relevant.
Solvable terms are a superset of the terms that convert to a final result
called normal form. Unsolvable terms are operationally irrelevant and can be
equated without loss of consistency. There is a definition of solvability for
the lambda-value calculus, called v-solvability, but it is not synonymous with
operational relevance, some lambda-value normal forms are unsolvable, and
unsolvables cannot be consistently equated. We provide a definition of
solvability for the lambda-value calculus that does capture operational
relevance and such that a consistent proof-theory can be constructed where
unsolvables are equated attending to the number of arguments they take (their
&quot;order&quot; in the jargon). The intuition is that in lambda-value the different
sequentialisations of a computation can be distinguished operationally. We
prove a version of the Genericity Lemma stating that unsolvable terms are
generic and can be replaced by arbitrary terms of equal or greater order.

 <dc:description>  Socioeconomic inequalities in cities are embedded in space and result in
neighborhood effects, whose harmful consequences have proved very hard to
counterbalance efficiently by planning policies alone. Considering
redistribution of money flows as a first step toward improved spatial equity,
we study a bottom-up approach that would rely on a slight evolution of shopping
mobility practices. Building on a database of anonymized credit card
transactions in Madrid and Barcelona, we quantify the mobility effort required
to reach a reference situation where commercial income is evenly shared among
neighborhoods. The redirections of shopping trips preserve key properties of
human mobility, including travel distances. Surprisingly, for both cities only
a small fraction ($\sim 5 \%$) of trips need to be altered to reach equity
situations, improving even other sustainability indicators. The method could be
implemented in mobile applications that would assist individuals in reshaping
their shopping practices, to promote the spatial redistribution of
opportunities in the city.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a modern method for implementing burst modems in GNU
Radio. Since burst modems are widely used for multi-user channel access and
sharing in non-broadcast radio systems, this capability is critical to the
development of numerous waveforms in GNU Radio. We focus on making such systems
easy to develop and adapt to wide classes of modems and computationally
efficient at runtime. We use the GNU Radio Event Stream scheduler to
demonstrate concise implementations of burst PSK and FSK modems in GNU Radio
and compare this with alternate approaches which have been attempted in GNU
Radio.

 <dc:description>  Considerable effort has been made to increase the scale of Linked Data.
However, an inevitable problem when dealing with data integration from multiple
sources is that multiple different sources often provide conflicting objects
for a certain predicate of the same real-world entity, so-called object
conflicts problem. Currently, the object conflicts problem has not received
sufficient attention in the Linked Data community. In this paper, we first
formalize the object conflicts resolution problem as computing the joint
distribution of variables on a heterogeneous information network called the
Source-Object Network, which successfully captures the all correlations from
objects and Linked Data sources. Then, we introduce a novel approach based on
network effects called ObResolution(Object Resolution), to identify a true
object from multiple conflicting objects. ObResolution adopts a pairwise Markov
Random Field (pMRF) to model all evidences under a unified framework. Extensive
experimental results on six real-world datasets show that our method exhibits
higher accuracy than existing approaches and it is robust and consistent in
various domains. \keywords{Linked Data, Object Conflicts, Linked Data Quality,

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the two-user broadcast channel and we characterize
its stable throughout region. We start the analysis by providing the stability
region for the general case without any specific considerations on transmission
and reception mechanisms. We also provide conditions for the stable throughput
region to be convex. Subsequently, we consider the case where the transmitter
uses superposition coding and we consider two special cases for the receivers.
The first one is when both receivers treat interference as noise. The second is
when the user with a better channel uses successive decoding and the other
receiver treats interference as noise.

 <dc:description>  Decentralized recommender system does not rely on the central service
provider, and the users can keep the ownership of their ratings. This article
brings the theoretically well-studied matrix factorization method into the
decentralized recommender system, where the formerly prevalent algorithms are
heuristic and hence lack of theoretical guarantee. Our preliminary simulation

 <dc:description>  In this study, we propose a novel method to measure bottom-up saliency maps
of natural images. In order to eliminate the influence of top-down signals,
backward masking is used to make stimuli (natural images) subjectively
invisible to subjects, however, the bottom-up saliency can still orient the
subjects attention. To measure this orientation/attention effect, we adopt the
cueing effect paradigm by deploying discrimination tasks at each location of an
image, and measure the discrimination performance variation across the image as
the attentional effect of the bottom-up saliency. Such attentional effects are
combined to construct a final bottomup saliency map. Based on the proposed
method, we introduce a new bottom-up saliency map dataset of natural images to
benchmark computational models. We compare several state-of-the-art saliency
models on the dataset. Moreover, the proposed paradigm is applied to
investigate the neural basis of the bottom-up visual saliency map by analyzing
psychophysical and fMRI experimental results. Our findings suggest that the
bottom-up saliency maps of natural images are constructed in V1. It provides a
strong scientific evidence to resolve the long standing dispute in neuroscience
about where the bottom-up saliency map is constructed in human brain.

 <dc:description>  We study a class of finite state machines, called \defi{$w$-matching
machines}, which yield to simulate the behavior of pattern matching algorithms
while searching for a pattern $w$. They can be used to compute the asymptotic
speed, i.e. the limit of the expected ratio of the number of text accesses to
the length of the text, of algorithms while parsing an iid text to find the
pattern $w$.
  Defining the order of a matching machine or of an algorithm as the maximum
difference between the current and accessed positions during a search (standard
algorithms are generally of order $|w|$), we show that being given a pattern
$w$, an order $k$ and an iid model, there exists an optimal $w$-matching
machine, i.e. with the greatest asymptotic speed under the model among all the
machines of order $k$, of which the set of states belongs to a finite and
enumerable set.
  It shows that it is possible to determine: 1) the greatest asymptotic speed
among a large class of algorithms, with regard to a pattern and an iid model,
and 2) a $w$-matching machine, thus an algorithm, achieving this speed.

 <dc:description>  Timed systems, such as timed automata, are usually analyzed using their
operational semantics on timed words. The classical region abstraction for
timed automata reduces them to (untimed) finite state automata with the same
time-abstract properties, such as state reachability. We propose a new
technique to analyze such timed systems using finite tree automata instead of
finite word automata. The main idea is to consider timed behaviors as graphs
with matching edges capturing timing constraints. When a family of graphs has
bounded tree-width, they can be interpreted in trees and MSO-definable
properties of such graphs can be checked using tree automata. The technique is
quite general and applies to many timed systems. In this paper, as an example,
we develop the technique on timed pushdown systems, which have recently
received considerable attention. Further, we also demonstrate how we can use it
on timed automata and timed multi-stack pushdown systems (with boundedness
restrictions).

 <dc:title>Exploiting variable associations to configure efficient local search

 <dc:description>  We present a data mining approach for reducing the search space of local
search algorithms in a class of binary integer programs including the set
covering and partitioning problems. The quality of locally optimal solutions
typically improves if a larger neighborhood is used, while the computation time
of searching the neighborhood increases exponentially. To overcome this, we
extract variable associations from the instance to be solved in order to
identify promising pairs of flipping variables in the neighborhood search.
Based on this, we develop a 4-flip neighborhood local search algorithm that
incorporates an efficient incremental evaluation of solutions and an adaptive
control of penalty weights. Computational results show that the proposed method
improves the performance of the local search algorithm for large-scale set
covering and partitioning problems.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the performance of the finite volume method in solving
viscoplastic flows. The creeping square lid-driven cavity flow of a Bingham
plastic is chosen as the test case and the constitutive equation is regularised
as proposed by Papanastasiou [J. Rheol. 31 (1987) 385-404]. It is shown that
the convergence rate of the standard SIMPLE pressure-correction algorithm,
which is used to solve the algebraic equation system that is produced by the
finite volume discretisation, severely deteriorates as the Bingham number
increases, with a corresponding increase in the non-linearity of the equations.
It is shown that using the SIMPLE algorithm in a multigrid context dramatically
improves convergence, although the multigrid convergence rates are much worse
than for Newtonian flows. The numerical results obtained for Bingham numbers as
high as 1000 compare favourably with reported results of other methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses a fuel-constrained, autonomous vehicle path planning
problem in the presence of multiple refueling stations. We are given a set of
targets, a set of refueling stations, and a depot where $m$ vehicles are
stationed. The vehicles are allowed to refuel at any refueling station, and the
objective of the problem is to determine a route for each vehicle starting and
terminating at the depot, such that each target is visited by at least one
vehicle, the vehicles never run out of fuel while traversing their routes, and
the total travel cost of all the routes is a minimum. We present four new
mixed-integer linear programming formulations for the problem. These
formulations are compared both analytically and empirically, and a
branch-and-cut algorithm is developed to compute an optimal solution. Extensive
computational results on a large class of test instances that corroborate the
effectiveness of the algorithm are also presented.

 <dc:description>  While cluster computing frameworks are continuously evolving to provide
real-time data analysis capabilities, Apache Spark has managed to be at the
forefront of big data analytics for being a unified framework for both, batch
and stream data processing. However, recent studies on micro-architectural
characterization of in-memory data analytics are limited to only batch
processing workloads. We compare micro-architectural performance of batch
processing and stream processing workloads in Apache Spark using hardware
performance counters on a dual socket server. In our evaluation experiments, we
have found that batch processing are stream processing workloads have similar
micro-architectural characteristics and are bounded by the latency of frequent
data access to DRAM. For data accesses we have found that simultaneous
multi-threading is effective in hiding the data latencies. We have also
observed that (i) data locality on NUMA nodes can improve the performance by
10% on average and(ii) disabling next-line L1-D prefetchers can reduce the
execution time by up-to 14\% and (iii) multiple small executors can provide
up-to 36\% speedup over single large executor.

 <dc:description>  Although TLS is used on a daily basis by many critical applications, the
public-key infrastructure that it relies on still lacks an adequate revocation
mechanism. An ideal revocation mechanism should be inexpensive, efficient,
secure, and privacy-preserving. Moreover, rising trends in pervasive encryption
pose new scalability challenges that a modern revocation system should address.
In this paper, we investigate how network nodes can deliver
certificate-validity information to clients. We present RITM, a framework in
which middleboxes (as opposed to clients, servers, or certification
authorities) store revocation-related data. RITM provides a secure
revocation-checking mechanism that preserves user privacy. We also propose to
take advantage of content-delivery networks (CDNs) and argue that they would
constitute a fast and cost-effective way to disseminate revocations.
Additionally, RITM keeps certification authorities accountable for the
revocations that they have issued, and it minimizes overhead at clients and
servers, as they have to neither store nor download any messages. We also
describe feasible deployment models and present an evaluation of RITM to
demonstrate its feasibility and benefits in a real-world deployment.

 <dc:title>Fully Dynamic Maximal Matching in Constant Update Time</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Solomon, Shay</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Baswana, Gupta and Sen [FOCS'11] showed that fully dynamic maximal matching
can be maintained in general graphs with logarithmic amortized update time.
More specifically, starting from an empty graph on $n$ fixed vertices, they
devised a randomized algorithm for maintaining maximal matching over any
sequence of $t$ edge insertions and deletions with a total runtime of $O(t \log
n)$ in expectation and $O(t \log n + n \log^2 n)$ with high probability.
Whether or not this runtime bound can be improved towards $O(t)$ has remained
an important open problem. Despite significant research efforts, this question
has resisted numerous attempts at resolution even for basic graph families such
as forests.
  In this paper, we resolve the question in the affirmative, by presenting a
randomized algorithm for maintaining maximal matching in general graphs with
\emph{constant} amortized update time. The optimal runtime bound $O(t)$ of our
algorithm holds both in expectation and with high probability.
  As an immediate corollary, we can maintain 2-approximate vertex cover with
constant amortized update time. This result is essentially the best one can
hope for (under the unique games conjecture) in the context of dynamic
approximate vertex cover, culminating a long line of research.
  Our algorithm builds on Baswana et al.'s algorithm, but is inherently
different and arguably simpler. As an implication of our simplified approach,
the space usage of our algorithm is linear in the (dynamic) graph size, while
the space usage of Baswana et al.'s algorithm is always at least $\Omega(n \log
n)$.
  Finally, we present applications to approximate weighted matchings and to
distributed networks.

 <dc:title>Detection of epileptic seizure in EEG signals using linear least squares
  preprocessing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zamir, Z. Roshan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An epileptic seizure is a transient event of abnormal excessive neuronal
discharge in the brain. This unwanted event can be obstructed by detection of
electrical changes in the brain that happen before the seizure takes place. The
automatic detection of seizures is necessary since the visual screening of EEG
recordings is a time consuming task and requires experts to improve the
diagnosis. Four linear least squares-based preprocessing models are proposed to
extract key features of an EEG signal in order to detect seizures. The first
two models are newly developed. The original signal (EEG) is approximated by a
sinusoidal curve. Its amplitude is formed by a polynomial function and compared
with the pre developed spline function.Different statistical measures namely
classification accuracy, true positive and negative rates, false positive and
negative rates and precision are utilized to assess the performance of the
proposed models. These metrics are derived from confusion matrices obtained
from classifiers. Different classifiers are used over the original dataset and
the set of extracted features. The proposed models significantly reduce the
dimension of the classification problem and the computational time while the
classification accuracy is improved in most cases. The first and third models
are promising feature extraction methods. Logistic, LazyIB1, LazyIB5 and J48
are the best classifiers. Their true positive and negative rates are $1$ while
false positive and negative rates are zero and the corresponding precision
values are $1$. Numerical results suggest that these models are robust and
efficient for detecting epileptic seizure.

 <dc:description>  Spammer detection on social network is a challenging problem. The rigid
anti-spam rules have resulted in emergence of &quot;smart&quot; spammers. They resemble
legitimate users who are difficult to identify. In this paper, we present a
novel spammer classification approach based on Latent Dirichlet
Allocation(LDA), a topic model. Our approach extracts both the local and the
global information of topic distribution patterns, which capture the essence of
spamming. Tested on one benchmark dataset and one self-collected dataset, our
proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of averaged
F1-score.

 <dc:description>  Massive networks have shown that the determination of dense subgraphs, where
vertices interact a lot, is necessary in order to visualize groups of common
interest, and therefore be able to decompose a big graph into smaller
structures. Many decompositions have been built over the years as part of
research in the graph mining field, and the topic is becoming a trend in the
last decade because of the increasing size of social networks and databases.
Here, we analyse some of the decompositions methods and also present a novel
one, the Vertex Triangle k-core. We then compare them and test them against
each other. Moreover, we establish different kind of measures for comparing the
accuracy of the decomposition methods. We apply these decompositions to real
world graphs, like the Collaboration network of arXiv graph, and found some
interesting results.

 <dc:title>Robust Joint Alignment of Multiple Versions of a Piece of Music</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Large music content libraries often comprise multiple versions of a piece of
music. To establish a link between different versions, automatic music
alignment methods map each position in one version to a corresponding position
in another version. Due to the leeway in interpreting a piece, any two versions
can differ significantly, for example, in terms of local tempo, articulation,
or playing style. For a given pair of versions, these differences can be
significant such that even state-of-the-art methods fail to identify a correct
alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that increases the
robustness for difficult to align cases. Instead of aligning only pairs of
versions as done in previous methods, our method aligns multiple versions in a
joint manner. This way, the alignment can be computed by comparing each version
not only with one but with several versions, which stabilizes the comparison
and leads to an increase in alignment robustness. Using recordings from the
Mazurka Project, the alignment error for our proposed method was 14% lower on
average compared to a state-of-the-art method, with significantly less outliers
(standard deviation 53% lower).

 <dc:title>A Probabilistic Adaptive Search System for Exploring the Face Space</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Face recall is a basic human cognitive process performed routinely, e.g.,
when meeting someone and determining if we have met that person before.
Assisting a subject during face recall by suggesting candidate faces can be
challenging. One of the reasons is that the search space - the face space - is
quite large and lacks structure. A commercial application of face recall is
facial composite systems - such as Identikit, PhotoFIT, and CD-FIT - where a
witness searches for an image of a face that resembles his memory of a
particular offender. The inherent uncertainty and cost in the evaluation of the
objective function, the large size and lack of structure of the search space,
and the unavailability of the gradient concept makes this problem inappropriate
for traditional optimization methods. In this paper we propose a novel
evolutionary approach for searching the face space that can be used as a facial
composite system. The approach is inspired by methods of Bayesian optimization
and differs from other applications in the use of the skew-normal distribution
as its acquisition function. This choice of acquisition function provides
greater granularity, with regularized, conservative, and realistic results.

an additive code C and its dual to Polarized Riemann-Roch Conditions on their
Zeta-functions. In such a way, the duality of additive codes appears to be a

 <dc:description>  Cellular operators are continuously densifying their networks to cope with
the ever-increasing capacity demand. Furthermore, an extreme densification
phase for cellular networks is foreseen to fulfill the ambitious fifth
generation (5G) performance requirements. Network densification improves
spectrum utilization and network capacity by shrinking base stations' (BSs)
footprints and reusing the same spectrum more frequently over the spatial
domain. However, network densification also increases the handover (HO) rate,
which may diminish the capacity gains for mobile users due to HO delays. In
highly dense 5G cellular networks, HO delays may neutralize or even negate the
gains offered by network densification. In this paper, we present an analytical
paradigm, based on stochastic geometry, to quantify the effect of HO delay on
the average user rate in cellular networks. To this end, we propose a flexible
handover scheme to reduce HO delay in case of highly dense cellular networks.
This scheme allows skipping the HO procedure with some BSs along users'
trajectories. The performance evaluation and testing of this scheme for only
single HO skipping shows considerable gains in many practical scenarios.

 <dc:description>  We present KADABRA, a new algorithm to approximate betweenness centrality in
directed and undirected graphs, which significantly outperforms all previous
approaches on real-world complex networks. The efficiency of the new algorithm
relies on two new theoretical contributions, of independent interest. The first
contribution focuses on sampling shortest paths, a subroutine used by most
algorithms that approximate betweenness centrality. We show that, on realistic
random graph models, we can perform this task in time $|E|^{\frac{1}{2}+o(1)}$
with high probability, obtaining a significant speedup with respect to the
$\Theta(|E|)$ worst-case performance. We experimentally show that this new
technique achieves similar speedups on real-world complex networks, as well.
The second contribution is a new rigorous application of the adaptive sampling
technique. This approach decreases the total number of shortest paths that need
to be sampled to compute all betweenness centralities with a given absolute
error, and it also handles more general problems, such as computing the $k$
most central nodes. Furthermore, our analysis is general, and it might be
extended to other settings.

 <dc:description>  In the framework of computational complexity and in an effort to define a
more natural reduction for problems of equivalence, we investigate the recently
introduced kernel reduction, a reduction that operates on each element of a
pair independently. This paper details the limitations and uses of kernel
reductions. We show that kernel reductions are weaker than many-one reductions
and provide conditions under which complete problems exist. Ultimately, the
number and size of equivalence classes can dictate the existence of a kernel
reduction. We leave unsolved the unconditional existence of a complete problem
under polynomial-time kernel reductions for the standard complexity classes.

 <dc:title>Comparing Fifty Natural Languages and Twelve Genetic Languages Using
  Word Embedding Language Divergence (WELD) as a Quantitative Measure of

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a new measure of distance between languages based on word
embedding, called word embedding language divergence (WELD). WELD is defined as
divergence between unified similarity distribution of words between languages.
Using such a measure, we perform language comparison for fifty natural
languages and twelve genetic languages. Our natural language dataset is a
collection of sentence-aligned parallel corpora from bible translations for
fifty languages spanning a variety of language families. Although we use
parallel corpora, which guarantees having the same content in all languages,
interestingly in many cases languages within the same family cluster together.
In addition to natural languages, we perform language comparison for the coding
regions in the genomes of 12 different organisms (4 plants, 6 animals, and two
human subjects). Our result confirms a significant high-level difference in the
genetic language model of humans/animals versus plants. The proposed method is
a step toward defining a quantitative measure of similarity between languages,
with applications in languages classification, genre identification, dialect
identification, and evaluation of translations.

 <dc:description>  In spite of the extensive literature on graph databases (GDBs), temporal GDBs
have not received too much attention so far. Temporal GBDs can capture, for
example, the evolution of social networks across time, a relevant topic in data
analysis nowadays. In this paper we propose a data model and query language
(denoted TEG-QL) for temporal GDBs, based on the notion of attribute graphs.
This allows a straightforward translation to Neo4J, a well-known GBD. We
present extensive examples of the use of TEG-QL, and comment our
implementation.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new caching scheme where linear combinations of the file
segments are cached at the users, for the cases where the number of files is no
greater than the number of users. When a user requests a certain file in the
delivery phase, the other file segments in the cached linear combinations can
be viewed as interferences. The proposed scheme combines rank metric codes and
maximum distance separable codes to facilitate the decoding and elimination of
these interferences, and also to simultaneously deliver useful contents to the
intended users. The performance of the proposed scheme can be explicitly
evaluated, and we show that the tradeoff points achieved by this scheme can
strictly improve known tradeoff inner bounds in the literature; for certain
special cases, the new tradeoff points can be shown to be optimal.

study the problem of partitioning the edge set of a graph $G$ into graphs taken
from any non-empty $S'\subseteq S$. The problem is known to be NP-complete for
any possible choice of $S'$ in general graphs. In this paper, we assume that
the input graph is cubic, and study the computational complexity of the problem
of partitioning its edge set for any choice of $S'$. We identify all polynomial
and NP-complete problems in that setting, and give graph-theoretic
characterisations of $S'$-decomposable cubic graphs in some cases.

 <dc:description>  Movie ratings play an important role both in determining the likelihood of a
potential viewer to watch the movie and in reflecting the current viewer
satisfaction with the movie. They are available in several sources like the
television guide, best-selling reference books, newspaper columns, and
television programs. Furthermore, movie ratings are crucial for recommendation
engines that track the behavior of all users and utilize the information to
suggest items they might like. Movie ratings in most cases, thus, provide
information that might be more important than movie feature-based data. It is
intuitively appealing that information about the viewing preferences in movie
genres is sufficient for predicting a genre of an unlabeled movie. In order to
predict movie genres, we treat ratings as a feature vector, apply the Bernoulli
event model to estimate the likelihood of a movies given genre, and evaluate
the posterior probability of the genre of a given movie using the Bayes rule.
The goal of the proposed technique is to efficiently use the movie ratings for
the task of predicting movie genres. In our approach we attempted to answer the
question: &quot;Given the set of users who watched a movie, is it possible to
predict the genre of a movie based on its ratings?&quot; Our simulation results with
MovieLens 100k data demonstrated the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed
technique, achieving 59% prediction rate for exact prediction and 69% when
including correlated genres.

 <dc:description>  In the past, manually re-drawing an image in a certain artistic style
required a professional artist and a long time. Doing this for a video sequence
single-handed was beyond imagination. Nowadays computers provide new
possibilities. We present an approach that transfers the style from one image
(for example, a painting) to a whole video sequence. We make use of recent
advances in style transfer in still images and propose new initializations and
loss functions applicable to videos. This allows us to generate consistent and
stable stylized video sequences, even in cases with large motion and strong
occlusion. We show that the proposed method clearly outperforms simpler
baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively.

 <dc:description>  Science is a crowning glory of the human spirit and its applications remain
our best hope for social progress. But there are limitations to current science
and perhaps to any science. The general mind-body problem is known to be
intractable and currently mysterious. This is one of many deep problems that
are universally agreed to be beyond the current purview of Science, including
quantum phenomena, etc. But all of these famous unsolved problems are either
remote from everyday experience (entanglement, dark matter) or are hard to even
define sharply (phenomenology, consciousness, etc.).
  In this note, we will consider some obvious computational problems in vision
that arise every time that we open our eyes and yet are demonstrably
incompatible with current theories of neural computation. The focus will be on
two related phenomena, known as the neural binding problem and the illusion of
a detailed stable visual world.

 <dc:description>  Network Functions Virtualization, or NFV, enables telecommunications
infrastructure providers to replace special-purpose networking equipment with
commodity servers running virtualized network functions (VNFs). A service
provider utilizing NFV technology faces the SFC provisioning problem of
assigning VNF instances to nodes in the physical infrastructure (e.g., a
datacenter), and routing Service Function Chains (sequences of functions
required by customers, a.k.a. SFCs) in the physical network. In doing so, the
provider must balance between various competing goals of performance and
resource usage. We present an approach for SFC provisioning, consisting of
three elements. The first element is a fast, scalable round-robin heuristic.
The second element is a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) based approach. The
third element is a queueing-theoretic model to estimate the average latency
associated with any SFC provisioning solution. Combined, these elements create
an approach that generates a set of SFC provisioning solutions, reflecting
different tradeoffs between resource usage and performance.

 <dc:description>  Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressing neurodegenerative disease
with early manifestation of motor signs. Objective measurements of motor signs
are of vital importance for diagnosing, monitoring and developing disease
modifying therapies, particularly for the early stages of the disease when
putative neuroprotective treatments could stop neurodegeneration. Current
medical practice has limited tools to routinely monitor PD motor signs with
enough frequency and without undue burden for patients and the healthcare
system. In this paper, we present data indicating that the routine interaction
with computer keyboards can be used to detect motor signs in the early stages
of PD. We explore a solution that measures the key hold times (the time
required to press and release a key) during the normal use of a computer
without any change in hardware and converts it to a PD motor index. This is
achieved by the automatic discovery of patterns in the time series of key hold
times using an ensemble regression algorithm. This new approach discriminated
early PD groups from controls with an AUC = 0.81 (n = 42/43; mean age =
59.0/60.1; women = 43%/60%;PD/controls). The performance was comparable or
better than two other quantitative motor performance tests used clinically:
alternating finger tapping (AUC = 0.75) and single key tapping (AUC = 0.61).

 <dc:description>  The increased penetration of uncertain and variable renewable energy presents
various resource and operational electric grid challenges. Micro-level
(household and small commercial) demand-side grid flexibility could be a
cost-effective strategy to integrate high penetrations of wind and solar
energy, but literature and field deployments exploring the necessary
information and communication technologies (ICTs) are scant. This paper
presents an exploratory framework for enabling information driven grid
flexibility through the Internet of Things (IoT), and a proof-of-concept
wireless sensor gateway (FlexBox) to collect the necessary parameters for
adequately monitoring and actuating the micro-level demand-side. In the summer
of 2015, thirty sensor gateways were deployed in the city of Managua
(Nicaragua) to develop a baseline for a near future small-scale demand response
pilot implementation. FlexBox field data has begun shedding light on
relationships between ambient temperature and load energy consumption, load and
building envelope energy efficiency challenges, latency communication network
challenges, and opportunities to engage existing demand-side user behavioral
patterns. Information driven grid flexibility strategies present great
opportunity to develop new technologies, system architectures, and
implementation approaches that can easily scale across regions, incomes, and
levels of development.

 <dc:description>  The most essential part of Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure is the
wireless communication system that acts as a bridge for the delivery of data
and control messages. However, the existing wireless technologies lack the
ability to support a huge amount of data exchange from many battery driven
devices spread over a wide area. In order to support the IoT paradigm, the IEEE
802.11 standard committee is in process of introducing a new standard, called
IEEE 802.11ah. This is one of the most promising and appealing standards, which
aims to bridge the gap between traditional mobile networks and the demands of
the IoT. In this paper, we first discuss the main PHY and MAC layer amendments
proposed for IEEE 802.11ah. Furthermore, we investigate the operability of IEEE
802.11ah as a backhaul link to connect devices over a long range. Additionally,
we compare the aforementioned standard with previous notable IEEE 802.11
amendments (i.e. IEEE 802.11n and IEEE 802.11ac) in terms of throughput (with
and without frame aggregation) by utilizing the most robust modulation schemes.
The results show an improved performance of IEEE 802.11ah (in terms of power
received at long range while experiencing different packet error rates) as
compared to previous IEEE 802.11 standards.

 <dc:description>  Exploiting the unlicensed spectrum is considered by 3GPP as one promising
solution to meet the ever-increasing traffic growth. As a result, one major
enhancement for LTE in Release 13 has been to enable its operation in the
unlicensed spectrum via Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA). In this article, we
provide an overview of the Release 13 LAA technology including motivation, use
cases, LTE enhancements for enabling the unlicensed band operation, and the
coexistence evaluation results contributed by 3GPP participants.

 <dc:description>  Recent work on word ordering has argued that syntactic structure is
important, or even required, for effectively recovering the order of a
sentence. We find that, in fact, an n-gram language model with a simple
heuristic gives strong results on this task. Furthermore, we show that a long
short-term memory (LSTM) language model is even more effective at recovering
order, with our basic model outperforming a state-of-the-art syntactic model by
11.5 BLEU points. Additional data and larger beams yield further gains, at the
expense of training and search time.

 <dc:title>Derivative-free Efficient Global Optimization on High-dimensional
  Simplex</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Methodology</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a novel derivative-free deterministic greedy
algorithm for global optimization of any objective function of parameters
belonging to a unit-simplex. Main principle of the proposed algorithm is making
jumps of varying step-sizes within the simplex parameter space and searching
for the best direction to move in a greedy manner. Unlike most of the other
existing methods of constraint optimization, here the objective function is
evaluated at independent directions within an iteration. Thus incorporation of
parallel computing makes it even faster. Requirement of parallelization grows
only in the order of the dimension of the parameter space, which makes it more
convenient for solving high-dimensional optimization problems in simplex
parameter space using parallel computing. A comparative study of the
performances of this algorithm and other existing algorithms have been shown
for some moderate and high-dimensional optimization problems along with some
transformed benchmark test-functions on simplex. Around 20-300 folds
improvement in computation time has been achieved using the proposed algorithm
over Genetic algorithm with more accurate solution.

 <dc:description>  Most research into similarity search in metric spaces relies upon the
triangle inequality property. This property allows the space to be arranged
according to relative distances to avoid searching some subspaces. We show that
many common metric spaces, notably including those using Euclidean and
Jensen-Shannon distances, also have a stronger property, sometimes called the
four-point property: in essence, these spaces allow an isometric embedding of
any four points in three-dimensional Euclidean space, as well as any three
points in two-dimensional Euclidean space. In fact, we show that any space
which is isometrically embeddable in Hilbert space has the stronger property.
This property gives stronger geometric guarantees, and one in particular, which
we name the Hilbert Exclusion property, allows any indexing mechanism which
uses hyperplane partitioning to perform better. One outcome of this observation
is that a number of state-of-the-art indexing mechanisms over high dimensional
spaces can be easily extended to give a significant increase in performance;
furthermore, the improvement given is greater in higher dimensions. This
therefore leads to a significant improvement in the cost of metric search in
these spaces.

 <dc:description>  The models developed to date for knowledge base embedding are all based on
the assumption that the relations contained in knowledge bases are binary. For
the training and testing of these embedding models, multi-fold (or n-ary)
relational data are converted to triples (e.g., in FB15K dataset) and
interpreted as instances of binary relations. This paper presents a canonical
representation of knowledge bases containing multi-fold relations. We show that
the existing embedding models on the popular FB15K datasets correspond to a
sub-optimal modelling framework, resulting in a loss of structural information.
We advocate a novel modelling framework, which models multi-fold relations
directly using this canonical representation. Using this framework, the
existing TransH model is generalized to a new model, m-TransH. We demonstrate
experimentally that m-TransH outperforms TransH by a large margin, thereby
establishing a new state of the art.

 <dc:description>  Let $ES(n)$ be the smallest integer such that any set of $ES(n)$ points in
the plane in general position contains $n$ points in convex position. In their
seminal 1935 paper, Erdos and Szekeres showed that $ES(n) \leq {2n - 4\choose
n-2} + 1 = 4^{n -o(n)}$. In 1960, they showed that $ES(n) \geq 2^{n-2} + 1$ and
conjectured this to be optimal. In this paper, we nearly settle the
Erdos-Szekeres conjecture by showing that $ES(n) =2^{n +o(n)}$.

 <dc:description>  We study the size and the external path length of random tries and show that
they are asymptotically independent in the asymmetric case but strongly
dependent with small periodic fluctuations in the symmetric case. Such an
unexpected behavior is in sharp contrast to the previously known results that
the internal path length is totally positively correlated to the size and that
both tend to the same normal limit law. These two examples provide concrete
instances of bivariate normal distributions (as limit laws) whose correlation
is $0$, $1$ and periodically oscillating.

 <dc:description>  Crowd counting is an important task in computer vision, which has many
applications in video surveillance. Although the regression-based framework has
achieved great improvements for crowd counting, how to improve the
discriminative power of image representation is still an open problem.
Conventional holistic features used in crowd counting often fail to capture
semantic attributes and spatial cues of the image. In this paper, we propose
integrating semantic information into learning locality-aware feature sets for
accurate crowd counting. First, with the help of convolutional neural network
(CNN), the original pixel space is mapped onto a dense attribute feature map,
where each dimension of the pixel-wise feature indicates the probabilistic
strength of a certain semantic class. Then, locality-aware features (LAF) built
on the idea of spatial pyramids on neighboring patches are proposed to explore
more spatial context and local information. Finally, the traditional VLAD
encoding method is extended to a more generalized form in which diverse
coefficient weights are taken into consideration. Experimental results validate
the effectiveness of our presented method.

 <dc:description>  Most traditional robotic mechanisms feature inelastic joints that are unable
to robustly handle large deformations and off-axis moments. As a result, the
applied loads are transferred rigidly throughout the entire structure. The
disadvantage of this approach is that the exerted leverage is magnified at each
subsequent joint possibly damaging the mechanism. In this paper, we present two
lightweight, elastic, bio-inspired tensegrity robotics arms which mitigate this
danger while improving their mechanism's functionality. Our solutions feature
modular tensegrity structures that function similarly to the human elbow and
the human shoulder when connected. Like their biological counterparts, the
proposed robotic joints are flexible and comply with unanticipated forces. Both
proposed structures have multiple passive degrees of freedom and four active
degrees of freedom (two from the shoulder and two from the elbow). The
structural advantages demonstrated by the joints in these manipulators
illustrate a solution to the fundamental issue of elegantly handling off-axis
compliance.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we consider the image super-resolution (SR) problem. The main
challenge of image SR is to recover high-frequency details of a low-resolution
(LR) image that are important for human perception. To address this essentially
ill-posed problem, we introduce a Deep Edge Guided REcurrent rEsidual~(DEGREE)
network to progressively recover the high-frequency details. Different from
most of existing methods that aim at predicting high-resolution (HR) images
directly, DEGREE investigates an alternative route to recover the difference
between a pair of LR and HR images by recurrent residual learning. DEGREE
further augments the SR process with edge-preserving capability, namely the LR
image and its edge map can jointly infer the sharp edge details of the HR image
during the recurrent recovery process. To speed up its training convergence
rate, by-pass connections across multiple layers of DEGREE are constructed. In
addition, we offer an understanding on DEGREE from the view-point of sub-band
frequency decomposition on image signal and experimentally demonstrate how
DEGREE can recover different frequency bands separately. Extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of DEGREE over
well-established baselines and DEGREE also provides new state-of-the-arts on
these datasets.

 <dc:description>  Aspect phrase grouping is an important task in aspect-level sentiment
analysis. It is a challenging problem due to polysemy and context dependency.
We propose an Attention-based Deep Distance Metric Learning (ADDML) method, by
considering aspect phrase representation as well as context representation.
First, leveraging the characteristics of the review text, we automatically
generate aspect phrase sample pairs for distant supervision. Second, we feed
word embeddings of aspect phrases and their contexts into an attention-based
neural network to learn feature representation of contexts. Both aspect phrase
embedding and context embedding are used to learn a deep feature subspace for
measure the distances between aspect phrases for K-means clustering.
Experiments on four review datasets show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art strong baseline methods.

 <dc:title>On Approximating Functions of the Singular Values in a Stream</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For any real number $p &gt; 0$, we nearly completely characterize the space
complexity of estimating $\|A\|_p^p = \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i^p$ for $n \times n$
matrices $A$ in which each row and each column has $O(1)$ non-zero entries and
whose entries are presented one at a time in a data stream model. Here the
$\sigma_i$ are the singular values of $A$, and when $p \geq 1$, $\|A\|_p^p$ is
the $p$-th power of the Schatten $p$-norm. We show that when $p$ is not an even
integer, to obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to $\|A\|_p^p$ with constant
probability, any $1$-pass algorithm requires $n^{1-g(\epsilon)}$ bits of space,
where $g(\epsilon) \rightarrow 0$ as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ and $\epsilon &gt;
0$ is a constant independent of $n$. However, when $p$ is an even integer, we
give an upper bound of $n^{1-2/p} \textrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)$ bits of
space, which holds even in the turnstile data stream model. The latter is
optimal up to $\textrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1} \log n)$ factors.
  Our results considerably strengthen lower bounds in previous work for
arbitrary (not necessarily sparse) matrices $A$: the previous best lower bound
was $\Omega(\log n)$ for $p\in (0,1)$, $\Omega(n^{1/p-1/2}/\log n)$ for $p\in
[1,2)$ and $\Omega(n^{1-2/p})$ for $p\in (2,\infty)$. We note for $p \in (2,
\infty)$, while our lower bound for even integers is the same, for other $p$ in
this range our lower bound is $n^{1-g(\epsilon)}$, which is considerably
stronger than the previous $n^{1-2/p}$ for small enough constant $\epsilon &gt;
0$. We obtain similar near-linear lower bounds for Ky-Fan norms, SVD entropy,
eigenvalue shrinkers, and M-estimators, many of which could have been solvable
in logarithmic space prior to our work.

 <dc:description>  Jointly optimal transmission power control and remote estimation over an
infinite horizon is studied. A sensor observes a dynamic process and sends its
observations to a remote estimator over a wireless fading channel characterized
by a time-homogeneous Markov chain. The successful transmission probability
depends on both the channel gains and the transmission power used by the
sensor. The transmission power control rule and the remote estimator should be
jointly designed, aiming to minimize an infinite-horizon cost consisting of the
power usage and the remote estimation error. A first question one may ask is:
Does this joint optimization problem have a solution? We formulate the joint
optimization problem as an average cost belief-state Markov decision process
and answer the question by proving that there exists an optimal deterministic
and stationary policy. We then show that when the monitored dynamic process is
scalar, the optimal remote estimates depend only on the most recently received
sensor observation, and the optimal transmission power is symmetric and
monotonically increasing with respect to the innovation error.

 <dc:description>  Most existing person re-identification (re-id) models focus on matching still
person images across disjoint camera views. Since only limited information can
be exploited from still images, it is hard (if not impossible) to overcome the
occlusion, pose and camera-view change, and lighting variation problems. In
comparison, video-based re-id methods can utilize extra space-time information,
which contains much more rich cues for matching to overcome the mentioned
problems. However, we find that when using video-based representation, some
inter-class difference can be much more obscure than the one when using
still-image based representation, because different people could not only have
similar appearance but also have similar motions and actions which are hard to
align. To solve this problem, we propose a top-push distance learning model
(TDL), in which we integrate a top-push constrain for matching video features
of persons. The top-push constraint enforces the optimization on top-rank
matching in re-id, so as to make the matching model more effective towards
selecting more discriminative features to distinguish different persons. Our
experiments show that the proposed video-based re-id framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art video-based re-id methods.

 <dc:description>  Understanding 3D object structure from a single image is an important but
difficult task in computer vision, mostly due to the lack of 3D object
annotations in real images. Previous work tackles this problem by either
solving an optimization task given 2D keypoint positions, or training on
synthetic data with ground truth 3D information. In this work, we propose 3D
INterpreter Network (3D-INN), an end-to-end framework which sequentially
estimates 2D keypoint heatmaps and 3D object structure, trained on both real
2D-annotated images and synthetic 3D data. This is made possible mainly by two
technical innovations. First, we propose a Projection Layer, which projects
estimated 3D structure to 2D space, so that 3D-INN can be trained to predict 3D
structural parameters supervised by 2D annotations on real images. Second,
heatmaps of keypoints serve as an intermediate representation connecting real
and synthetic data, enabling 3D-INN to benefit from the variation and abundance
of synthetic 3D objects, without suffering from the difference between the
statistics of real and synthesized images due to imperfect rendering. The
network achieves state-of-the-art performance on both 2D keypoint estimation
and 3D structure recovery. We also show that the recovered 3D information can
be used in other vision applications, such as 3D rendering and image retrieval.

 <dc:description>  Exploring small connected and induced subgraph patterns (CIS patterns, or
graphlets) has recently attracted considerable attention. Despite recent
efforts on computing the number of instances a specific graphlet appears in a
large graph (i.e., the total number of CISes isomorphic to the graphlet),
little attention has been paid to characterizing a node's graphlet degree,
i.e., the number of CISes isomorphic to the graphlet that include the node,
which is an important metric for analyzing complex networks such as social and
biological networks. Similar to global graphlet counting, it is challenging to
compute node graphlet degrees for a large graph due to the combinatorial nature
of the problem. Unfortunately, previous methods of computing global graphlet
counts are not suited to solve this problem. In this paper we propose sampling
methods to estimate node graphlet degrees for undirected and directed graphs,
and analyze the error of our estimates. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to study this problem and give a fast scalable solution. We conduct
experiments on a variety of real-word datasets that demonstrate that our
methods accurately and efficiently estimate node graphlet degrees for graphs
with millions of edges.

 <dc:title>Optimal data recovery and forecasting with dummy long-horizon forecasts</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dokuchaev, Nikolai</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Statistics Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The paper suggests a method of recovering missing values for sequences,
including sequences with a multidimensional index, based on optimal
approximation by processes featuring spectrum degeneracy. The problem is
considered in the pathwise setting, without using probabilistic assumptions on
the ensemble. The method requires to solve a closed linear equation connecting
the available observations of the underlying process with the values of the
approximating process with degenerate spectrum outside the observation
range.Some robustness with respect to noise contamination is established for
the suggested recovering algorithm. It is suggested to apply this data recovery
algorithm to forecasting with a preselected dummy long-horizon forecast that
helps to regularize the solution.

 <dc:description>  The development of international cooperation requires cooperation in the
sphere of education. An enhanced sharing of experience in the sphere of
practical teaching activities implies the increase of the quality of teaching
process and of scientific cooperation. Sharing of experience in educational
activities implies understanding among representatives of different nations
anywhere in the world. It means that through LSM teaching the principle of
social constructivism is realized, when participants together create a narrow
culture of common objects and senses. The article presents an example of
practical application of electronic media to the process of a real lesson. The
article describes the process of teaching students from different countries
using the system of LMS MOODLE, beginning with preparing study materials,
giving lectures by foreign lecturers, practical tasks and ending with passing
an examination. Training has included some full-time students from the Slovak
Republic, the Republic of Dagestan and the Republic of Kazakhstan, and has been
realized by applying the method of distance learning (LMS).

 <dc:title>Relative Convex Hull Determination from Convex Hulls in the Plane</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Reyes, H.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A new algorithm for the determination of the relative convex hull in the
plane of a simple polygon A with respect to another simple polygon B which
contains A, is proposed. The relative convex hull is also known as geodesic
convex hull, and the problem of its determination in the plane is equivalent to
find the shortest curve among all Jordan curves lying in the difference set of
B and A and encircling A. Algorithms solving this problem known from
Computational Geometry are based on the triangulation or similar decomposition
of that difference set. The algorithm presented here does not use such
decomposition, but it supposes that A and B are given as ordered sequences of
vertices. The algorithm is based on convex hull calculations of A and B and of
smaller polygons and polylines, it produces the output list of vertices of the
relative convex hull from the sequence of vertices of the convex hull of A.

 <dc:title>Mobile Robot Navigation on Partially Known Maps using a Fast A Star
  Algorithm Version</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Muntean, Paul</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Mobile robot navigation in total or partially unknown environments is still
an open problem. The path planning algorithms lack completeness and/or
performance. Thus, there is the need for complete (i.e., the algorithm
determines in finite time either a solution or correctly reports that there is
none) and performance (i.e., with low computational complexity) oriented
algorithms which need to perform efficiently in real scenarios. In this paper
we evaluate the efficiency of two versions of the A star algorithm for mobile
robot navigation inside indoor environments with the help of two software
applications and the Pioneer 2DX robot. We demonstrate that an improved version
of the A star algorithm (we call this the fast A star algorithm) which (a
different version of this algorithm is widely used in video games) can be
successfully used for indoor mobile robot navigation. We evaluated the two
versions of the A star algorithm first, by implementing the algorithms in
source code and by testing them on a simulator and second, by comparing two
operation modes of the fast A star algorithm w.r.t. path planning efficiency
(i.e., completness) and performance (i.e., time need to complete the path
traversing) for indoor navigation with the Pioneer 2DX robot. The results
obtained with the fast A star algorithm are promising and we think that this
results can be further improved by tweaking the algorithm and by using an
advanced sensor fusion approach (i.e., combine the inputs of multiple robot
sensors) for better dealing with partially known environments.

 <dc:title>&quot;Knowing value&quot; logic as a normal modal logic</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  Recent years witness a growing interest in nonstandard epistemic logics of
&quot;knowing whether&quot;, &quot;knowing what&quot;, &quot;knowing how&quot;, and so on. These logics are
usually not normal, i.e., the standard axioms and reasoning rules for modal
logic may be invalid. In this paper, we show that the conditional &quot;knowing
value&quot; logic proposed by Wang and Fan \cite{WF13} can be viewed as a disguised
normal modal logic by treating the negation of the Kv operator as a special
diamond. Under this perspective, it turns out that the original first-order
Kripke semantics can be greatly simplified by introducing a ternary relation
$R_i^c$ in standard Kripke models, which associates one world with two
$i$-accessible worlds that do not agree on the value of constant $c$. Under
intuitive constraints, the modal logic based on such Kripke models is exactly
the one studied by Wang and Fan (2013,2014}. Moreover, there is a very natural
binary generalization of the &quot;knowing value&quot; diamond, which, surprisingly, does
not increase the expressive power of the logic. The resulting logic with the
binary diamond has a transparent normal modal system, which sharpens our
understanding of the &quot;knowing value&quot; logic and simplifies some previously hard
problems.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new learned descriptor for audio signals which is efficient
for event representation. The entries of the descriptor are produced by
evaluating a set of regressors on the input signal. The regressors are
class-specific and trained using the random regression forests framework. Given
an input signal, each regressor estimates the onset and offset positions of the
target event. The estimation confidence scores output by a regressor are then
used to quantify how the target event aligns with the temporal structure of the
corresponding category. Our proposed descriptor has two advantages. First, it
is compact, i.e. the dimensionality of the descriptor is equal to the number of
event classes. Second, we show that even simple linear classification models,
trained on our descriptor, yield better accuracies on audio event
classification task than not only the nonlinear baselines but also the
state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:description>  We apply deep learning methods, specifically long short-term memory (LSTM)
networks, to music transcription modelling and composition. We build and train
LSTM networks using approximately 23,000 music transcriptions expressed with a
high-level vocabulary (ABC notation), and use them to generate new
transcriptions. Our practical aim is to create music transcription models
useful in particular contexts of music composition. We present results from
three perspectives: 1) at the population level, comparing descriptive
statistics of the set of training transcriptions and generated transcriptions;
2) at the individual level, examining how a generated transcription reflects
the conventions of a music practice in the training transcriptions (Celtic
folk); 3) at the application level, using the system for idea generation in
music composition. We make our datasets, software and sound examples open and

 <dc:title>Exploring Social Networks for Optimized User Association in Wireless

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel social network aware approach for user
association in wireless small cell networks. The proposed approach exploits
social relationships between user equipments (UEs) and their physical proximity
to optimize the network throughput. We formulate the problem as a matching game
between UEs and their serving nodes (SNs). In our proposed game, the serving
node can be a small cell base station (SCBS) or an important node with
device-to-device capabilities. In this game, the SCBSs and UEs maximize their
respective utility functions capturing both the spatial and social structures
of the network. We show that the proposed game belongs to the class of matching
games with externalities. Subsequently, we propose a distributed algorithm
using which the SCBSs and UEs interact and reach a stable matching. We show the
convergence of the proposed algorithm and study the properties of the resulting
matching. Simulation results show that the proposed socially-aware user
association approach can efficiently offload traffic while yielding a
significant gain reaching up to 63% in terms of data rates as compared to the
classical (social-unaware) approach.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel low-complexity hybrid
linear/Tomlinson-Harashima precoder (H-L-THP) for downlink large-scale
multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. The proposed
precoder comprises an inner linear precoder which utilizes only the second
order statistics of the channel state information (CSI) and outer THPs which
use the instantaneous overall CSI of the cascade of the actual channel and the
inner precoder. The user terminals are divided into groups, where for each
group a THP successively mitigates the intra-group interference, whereas the
inter-group interference is canceled by the inner linear precoder. Our
simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed H-L-THP
precoder is close to that of the conventional THP precoder, and is
substantially lower than the BER of the commonly used regularized zero-forcing
(RZF) precoder. Moreover, we derive exact expressions for the computational
complexity of the proposed H-L-THP precoder in terms of the required numbers of
floating-point operations. These results reveal that the proposed H-L-THP
precoder has a much lower computational complexity than the conventional THP
and RZF precoders, and is thus an excellent candidate for practical
implementations.

 <dc:description>  Vehicles are among the fastest growing type of connected devices. Therefore,
there is a need for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication i.e. passing of
information from a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)
and vice versa. In this paper, the main focus is on the communication between
vehicles and road side units (RSUs) commonly referred to as V2I communication
in a multi-lane freeway scenario. Moreover, we analyze network related
bottlenecks such as the maximum number of vehicles that can be supported when
coverage is provided by the Long Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) network. The
performance evaluation is assessed through extensive system-level simulations.
Results show that new resource allocation and interference mitigation
techniques are needed in order to achieve the required high reliability
requirements, especially when network load is high.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present the formal, computer-supported verification of a
functional implementation of Buchberger's critical-pair/completion algorithm
for computing Gr\&quot;obner bases in reduction rings. We describe how the algorithm
can be implemented and verified within one single software system, which in our
case is the Theorema system.
  In contrast to existing formal correctness proofs of Buchberger's algorithm
in other systems, e. g. Coq and ACL2, our work is not confined to the classical
setting of polynomial rings over fields, but considers the much more general
setting of reduction rings; this, naturally, makes the algorithm more
complicated and the verification more difficult.
  The correctness proof is essentially based on some non-trivial results from
the theory of reduction rings, which we formalized and formally proved as well.
This formalization already consists of more than 800 interactively proved
lemmas and theorems, making the elaboration an extensive example of
higher-order theory exploration in Theorema.

 <dc:description>  LFR is a popular benchmark graph generator used to evaluate community
detection algorithms. We present EM-LFR, the first external memory algorithm
able to generate massive complex networks following the LFR benchmark. Its most
expensive component is the generation of random graphs with prescribed degree
sequences which can be divided into two steps: the graphs are first
materialized deterministically using the Havel-Hakimi algorithm, and then
randomized. Our main contributions are EM-HH and EM-ES, two I/O-efficient
external memory algorithms for these two steps. We also propose EM-CM/ES, an
alternative sampling scheme using the Configuration Model and rewiring steps to
obtain a random simple graph. In an experimental evaluation we demonstrate
their performance; our implementation is able to handle graphs with more than
37 billion edges on a single machine, is competitive with a massive parallel
distributed algorithm, and is faster than a state-of-the-art internal memory
implementation even on instances fitting in main memory. EM-LFR's
implementation is capable of generating large graph instances orders of
magnitude faster than the original implementation. We give evidence that both
implementations yield graphs with matching properties by applying clustering
algorithms to generated instances. Similarly, we analyse the evolution of graph
properties as EM-ES is executed on networks obtained with EM-CM/ES and find
that the alternative approach can accelerate the sampling process.

 <dc:description>  We derive Bose-Einstein statistics and Fermi-Dirac statistics by Principle of
Maximum Entropy applied to two families of entropy functions different from the
Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy. These entropy functions are identified with
special cases of modified Naudts' $\phi$-entropy.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In online convex optimization it is well known that certain subclasses of
objective functions are much easier than arbitrary convex functions. We are
interested in designing adaptive methods that can automatically get fast rates
in as many such subclasses as possible, without any manual tuning. Previous
adaptive methods are able to interpolate between strongly convex and general
convex functions. We present a new method, MetaGrad, that adapts to a much
broader class of functions, including exp-concave and strongly convex
functions, but also various types of stochastic and non-stochastic functions
without any curvature. For instance, MetaGrad can achieve logarithmic regret on
the unregularized hinge loss, even though it has no curvature, if the data come
from a favourable probability distribution. MetaGrad's main feature is that it
simultaneously considers multiple learning rates. Unlike previous methods with
provable regret guarantees, however, its learning rates are not monotonically
decreasing over time and are not tuned based on a theoretically derived bound
on the regret. Instead, they are weighted directly proportional to their
empirical performance on the data using a tilted exponential weights master
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates a situation pointed out in a recent paper, in which a
non-singular change of assembly mode of a planar 2-RPR-PR parallel manipulator
was realized by encircling a point of multiplicity 4. It is shown that this
situation is, in fact, a non-generic one and gives rise to cusps under a small
perturbation. Furthermore , we show that, for a large class of singularities of
multiplicity 4, there are only two types of stable singularities occurring in a
small perturbation: these two types are given by the complex square mapping and
the quarto mapping. Incidentally , this paper confirms the fact that,
generically, a local non-singular change of solution must be accomplished by
encircling a cusp point.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop novel two-tier interference management strategies
that enable macrocell users (MUEs) to improve their performance, with the help
of open-access femtocells. To this end, we propose a rate-splitting technique
using which the MUEs optimize their uplink transmissions by dividing their
signals into two types: a coarse message that is intended for direct
transmission to the macrocell base station and a fine message that is decoded
by a neighboring femtocell and subsequently relayed over a heterogeneous
(wireless/wired) backhaul. For deploying the proposed technique, we formulate a
non-cooperative game between the MUEs in which each MUE can decide on its
relaying femtocell while maximizing a utility function that captures both the
achieved throughput and the expected backhaul delay. Simulation results show
that the proposed approach yields up to 125% rate improvement and up to 2 times
delay reduction with wired backhaul and, 150% rate improvement and up to 10
times delay reduction with wireless backhaul, relative to classical
interference management approaches, with no cross-tier cooperation.

 <dc:description>  The design of energy-efficient mechanisms is one of the key challenges in
emerging wireless small cell networks. In this paper, a novel approach for
opportunistically switching ON/OFF base stations to improve the energy
efficiency in wireless small cell networks is proposed. The proposed approach
enables the small cell base stations to optimize their downlink performance
while balancing the load among each another, while satisfying their users'
quality-of-service requirements. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative
game among the base stations that seek to minimize a cost function which
captures the tradeoff between energy expenditure and load. To solve this game,
a distributed learning algorithm is proposed using which the base stations
autonomously choose their optimal transmission strategies. Simulation results
show that the proposed approach yields significant performance gains in terms
of reduced energy expenditures up to 23% and reduced load up to 40% compared to
conventional approaches.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel cluster-based approach for optimizing the energy
efficiency of wireless small cell networks is proposed. A dynamic mechanism
based on the spectral clustering technique is proposed to dynamically form
clusters of small cell base stations. Such clustering enables intra-cluster
coordination among the base stations for optimizing the downlink performance
through load balancing, while satisfying users' quality-of-service
requirements. In the proposed approach, the clusters use an opportunistic base
station sleep-wake switching mechanism to strike a balance between delay and
energy consumption. The inter-cluster interference affects the performance of
the clusters and their choices of active or sleep state. Due to the lack of
inter-cluster communications, the clusters have to compete with each other to
make decisions on improving the energy efficiency. This competition is
formulated as a noncooperative game among the clusters that seek to minimize a
cost function which captures the tradeoff between energy expenditure and load.
To solve this game, a distributed learning algorithm is proposed using which
the clusters autonomously choose their optimal transmission strategies.
Simulation results show that the proposed approach yields significant
performance gains in terms of reduced energy expenditures up to 40% and reduced
load up to 23% compared to conventional approaches.

 <dc:description>  The deviation of the observed frequency of a word $w$ from its expected
frequency in a given sequence $x$ is used to determine whether or not the word
is avoided. This concept is particularly useful in DNA linguistic analysis. The
value of the standard deviation of $w$, denoted by $std(w)$, effectively
characterises the extent of a word by its edge contrast in the context in which
it occurs. A word $w$ of length $k&gt;2$ is a $\rho$-avoided word in $x$ if
$std(w) \leq \rho$, for a given threshold $\rho &lt; 0$. Notice that such a word
may be completely absent from $x$. Hence computing all such words na\&quot;{\i}vely
can be a very time-consuming procedure, in particular for large $k$. In this
article, we propose an $O(n)$-time and $O(n)$-space algorithm to compute all
$\rho$-avoided words of length $k$ in a given sequence $x$ of length $n$ over a
fixed-sized alphabet. We also present a time-optimal $O(\sigma n)$-time and
$O(\sigma n)$-space algorithm to compute all $\rho$-avoided words (of any
length) in a sequence of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\sigma$.
Furthermore, we provide a tight asymptotic upper bound for the number of
$\rho$-avoided words and the expected length of the longest one. We make
available an open-source implementation of our algorithm. Experimental results,
using both real and synthetic data, show the efficiency of our implementation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel approach for joint power control and user scheduling
is proposed for optimizing energy efficiency (EE), in terms of bits per unit
power, in ultra dense small cell networks (UDNs). To address this problem, a
dynamic stochastic game (DSG) is formulated between small cell base stations
(SBSs). This game enables to capture the dynamics of both queues and channel
states of the system. To solve this game, assuming a large homogeneous UDN
deployment, the problem is cast as a mean field game (MFG) in which the MFG
equilibrium is analyzed with the aid of two low-complexity tractable partial
differential equations. User scheduling is formulated as a stochastic
optimization problem and solved using the drift plus penalty (DPP) approach in
the framework of Lyapunov optimization. Remarkably, it is shown that by weaving
notions from Lyapunov optimization and mean field theory, the proposed solution
yields an equilibrium control policy per SBS which maximizes the network
utility while ensuring users' quality-of-service. Simulation results show that
the proposed approach achieves up to 18:1% gains in EE and 98.2% reductions in
the network's outage probability compared to a baseline model.

 <dc:description>  The optimization version of the Unique Label Cover problem is at the heart of
the Unique Games Conjecture which has played an important role in the proof of
several tight inapproximability results. In recent years, this problem has been
also studied extensively from the point of view of parameterized complexity.
Cygan et al. [FOCS 2012] proved that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable
(FPT) and Wahlstr\&quot;om [SODA 2014] gave an FPT algorithm with an improved
parameter dependence. Subsequently, Iwata, Wahlstr\&quot;om and Yoshida [2014]
proved that the edge version of Unique Label Cover can be solved in linear
FPT-time. That is, there is an FPT algorithm whose dependence on the input-size
is linear. However, such an algorithm for the node version of the problem was
left as an open problem. In this paper, we resolve this question by presenting
the first linear-time FPT algorithm for Node Unique Label Cover.

 <dc:description>  We relate behavior composition, a synthesis task studied in AI, to
supervisory control theory from the discrete event systems field. In
particular, we show that realizing (i.e., implementing) a target behavior
module (e.g., a house surveillance system) by suitably coordinating a
collection of available behaviors (e.g., automatic blinds, doors, lights,
cameras, etc.) amounts to imposing a supervisor onto a special discrete event
system. Such a link allows us to leverage on the solid foundations and
extensive work on discrete event systems, including borrowing tools and ideas
from that field. As evidence of that we show how simple it is to introduce
preferences in the mapped framework.

restricting ourselves to storing only global information about an image allows
us to achieve high quality 'conceptual compression'.

 <dc:description>  The edge intersection graph of a family of paths in host tree is called an
$EPT$ graph. When the host tree has maximum degree $h$, we say that $G$ belongs
to the class $[h,2,2]$. If, in addition, the family of paths satisfies the
Helly property, then $G \in$ Helly $[h,2,2]$.
  The time complexity of the recognition of the classes
  $[h,2,2]$ inside the class $EPT$ is open for every $h&gt; 4$. Golumbic et al.
wonder if the only obstructions for an $EPT$ graph belonging to $[h,2,2]$ are
the chordless cycles $C_n$ for $n&gt; h$. In the present paper, we give a negative
answer to that question, we present a family of $EPT$ graphs which are
forbidden induced subgraphs for the classes $[h,2,2]$.
  Using them we obtain a total characterization by induced forbidden subgraphs
of the classes Helly $[h,2,2]$ for $h\geq 4$ inside the class $EPT$. As a
byproduct, we prove that Helly $EPT$$\cap [h,2,2]=$ Helly $[h,2,2]$. We
characterize Helly $[h,2,2]$ graphs by their atoms in the decomposition by
clique separators. We give an efficient algorithm to recognize Helly $[h,2,2]$
graphs.

 <dc:description>  Robot game is a two-player vector addition game played on the integer lattice
$\mathbb{Z}^n$. Both players have sets of vectors and in each turn the vector
chosen by a player is added to the current configuration vector of the game.
One of the players, called Eve, tries to play the game from the initial
configuration to the origin while the other player, Adam, tries to avoid the
origin. The problem is to decide whether or not Eve has a winning strategy. In
this paper we prove undecidability of the robot game in dimension two answering
the question formulated by Doyen and Rabinovich in 2011 and closing the gap
between undecidable and decidable cases.

 <dc:description>  &quot;Natural Language,&quot; whether spoken and attended to by humans, or processed
and generated by computers, requires networked structures that reflect creative
processes in semantic, syntactic, phonetic, linguistic, social, emotional, and
cultural modules. Being able to produce novel and useful behavior following
repeated practice gets to the root of both artificial intelligence and human
language. This paper investigates the modalities involved in language-like
applications that computers -- and programmers -- engage with, and aims to fine
tune the questions we ask to better account for context, self-awareness, and
embodiment.

 <dc:description>  Approximate computing (AC) is an emerging paradigm for energy-efficient
computation. The basic idea of AC is to sacrifice high precision for low energy
by allowing for hardware which only carries out &quot;approximately correct&quot;
calculations. For software verification, this challenges the validity of
verification results for programs run on approximate hardware.
  In this paper, we present a novel approach to examine program correctness in
the context of approximate computing. In contrast to all existing approaches,
we start with a standard program verification and compute the allowed
tolerances for AC hardware from that verification run. More precisely, we
derive a set of constraints which - when met by the AC hardware - guarantees
the verification result to carry over to AC. Our approach is based on the
framework of abstract interpretation. On the practical side, we furthermore (1)
show how to extract tolerance constraints from verification runs employing
predicate abstraction as an instance of abstract interpretation, and (2) show
how to check such constraints on hardware designs. We exemplify our technique
on example C programs and a number of recently proposed approximate adders.

 <dc:title>Effective Backscatter Approximation for Photometry in Murky Water</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Shading-based approaches like Photometric Stereo assume that the image
formation model can be effectively optimized for the scene normals. However, in
murky water this is a very challenging problem. The light from artificial
sources is not only reflected by the scene but it is also scattered by the
medium particles, yielding the backscatter component. Backscatter corresponds
to a complex term with several unknown variables, and makes the problem of
normal estimation hard. In this work, we show that instead of trying to
optimize the complex backscatter model or use previous unrealistic
simplifications, we can approximate the per-pixel backscatter signal directly
from the captured images. Our method is based on the observation that
backscatter is saturated beyond a certain distance, i.e. it becomes scene-depth
independent, and finally corresponds to a smoothly varying signal which depends
strongly on the light position with respect to each pixel. Our backscatter
approximation method facilitates imaging and scene reconstruction in murky
water when the illumination is artificial as in Photometric Stereo.
Specifically, we show that it allows accurate scene normal estimation and
offers potentials like single image restoration. We evaluate our approach using
numerical simulations and real experiments within both the controlled
environment of a big water-tank and real murky port-waters.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the problem of identification of photovoltaic arrays'
maximum power extraction point---information that is encrypted in the
current-voltage characteristic equation. We propose a new parameterisation of
the classical five parameter model of this function that, combined with the
recently introduced identification technique of dynamic regressor extension and
mixing, ensures a fast and accurate estimation of all unknown parameters. A
concavity property of the current-voltage characteristic equation is then
exploited to directly identify the desired voltage operating point. Realistic
numerical examples via computer simulations are presented to assess the
performance of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  An ortho-polygon visibility representation of an $n$-vertex embedded graph
$G$ (OPVR of $G$) is an embedding-preserving drawing of $G$ that maps every
vertex to a distinct orthogonal polygon and each edge to a vertical or
horizontal visibility between its end-vertices. The vertex complexity of an
OPVR of $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that every polygon has at most $k$ reflex
corners. We present polynomial time algorithms that test whether $G$ has an
OPVR and, if so, compute one of minimum vertex complexity. We argue that the
existence and the vertex complexity of an OPVR of $G$ are related to its number
of crossings per edge and to its connectivity. More precisely, we prove that if
$G$ has at most one crossing per edge (i.e., $G$ is a 1-plane graph), an OPVR
of $G$ always exists while this may not be the case if two crossings per edge
are allowed. Also, if $G$ is a 3-connected 1-plane graph, we can compute an
OPVR of $G$ whose vertex complexity is bounded by a constant in $O(n)$ time.
However, if $G$ is a 2-connected 1-plane graph, the vertex complexity of any
OPVR of $G$ may be $\Omega(n)$. In contrast, we describe a family of
2-connected 1-plane graphs for which an embedding that guarantees constant
vertex complexity can be computed in $O(n)$ time. Finally, we present the
results of an experimental study on the vertex complexity of ortho-polygon
visibility representations of 1-plane graphs.

 <dc:description>  Fault tolerance is increasingly important for unmanned autonomous vehicles.
For example, in a multi robot system the agents need the ability to effectively
detect and tolerate internal failures in order to continue performing their
tasks without the need for immediate human intervention. The system must react
to unplanned events in order to optimize the task allocation between the
robots. In a broad sense, the resilience of a system can be defined as the
ability to maintain or recover a stable state when subject to disturbance and
it is related to the concept of robustness in industrial systems. In this
paper, we study the resilience in a synchronized multi-robot system stated as
follows:Consider a team of $n$ (ground or aerial) robots each moving along
predetermined periodic closed trajectories. Each of the agents needs to
communicate informationabout its operation to other agents, but the
communication links have a limited range. Hence, when two agents are within
communication range, a communication link is established, and information is
exchanged. Thus, two neighbors are synchronized if they visit the communication
link at the same time and a multi-robot system is called synchronized if each
pair of neighbors is synchronized. If a set of robots left the system, then
some trajectories has no robots. In these cases, when an alive robot detects no
neighboring robot then it pass to this neighboring trajectory to assume the
unattended task. In this framework, a fault-tolerance measure is introduced:
the resilience of the system is the largest number of robots that can fail
while executing the global task. Interesting combinatorial properties of the
resilience are showed that allow to know its value for some usual scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Three dimensional (3D) interest point detection plays a fundamental role in
computer vision. In this paper, we introduce a new method for detecting 3D
interest points of 3D mesh models based on geometric measures and sparse
refinement (GMSR). The key point of our approach is to calculate the 3D
saliency measure using two novel geometric measures, which are defined in
multi-scale space to effectively distinguish 3D interest points from edges and
flat areas. Those points with local maxima of 3D saliency measure are selected
as the candidates of 3D interest points. Finally, we utilize an $l_0$ norm
based optimization method to refine the candidates of 3D interest points by
constraining the number of 3D interest points. Numerical experiments show that
the proposed GMSR based 3D interest point detector outperforms current six
state-of-the-art methods for different kinds of 3D mesh models.

 <dc:description>  The increasing power of computer technology does not dispense with the need
to extract meaningful in- formation out of data sets of ever growing size, and
indeed typically exacerbates the complexity of this task. To tackle this
general problem, two methods have emerged, at chronologically different times,
that are now commonly used in the scientific community: data mining and complex
network theory. Not only do complex network analysis and data mining share the
same general goal, that of extracting information from complex systems to
ultimately create a new compact quantifiable representation, but they also
often address similar problems too. In the face of that, a surprisingly low
number of researchers turn out to resort to both methodologies. One may then be
tempted to conclude that these two fields are either largely redundant or
totally antithetic. The starting point of this review is that this state of
affairs should be put down to contingent rather than conceptual differences,
and that these two fields can in fact advantageously be used in a synergistic
manner. An overview of both fields is first provided, some fundamental concepts
of which are illustrated. A variety of contexts in which complex network theory
and data mining have been used in a synergistic manner are then presented.
Contexts in which the appropriate integration of complex network metrics can
lead to improved classification rates with respect to classical data mining
algorithms and, conversely, contexts in which data mining can be used to tackle
important issues in complex network theory applications are illustrated.
Finally, ways to achieve a tighter integration between complex networks and
data mining, and open lines of research are discussed.

 <dc:title>Opening the Frey/Osborne Black Box: Which Tasks of a Job are Susceptible
  to Computerization?</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In their seminal paper, Frey and Osborne quantified the automation of jobs,
by assigning each job in the O*NET database a probability to be automated. In
this paper, we refine their results in the following way: Every O*NET job
consists of a set of tasks, and these tasks can be related. We use a linear
program to assign probabilities to tasks, such that related tasks have a
similar probability and the tasks can explain the computerization probability
of a job. Analyzing jobs on the level of tasks helps comprehending the results,
as experts as well as laymen can more easily criticize and refine what parts of
a job are susceptible to computerization.

 <dc:title>Improved Dense Trajectory with Cross Streams</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Improved dense trajectories (iDT) have shown great performance in action
recognition, and their combination with the two-stream approach has achieved
state-of-the-art performance. It is, however, difficult for iDT to completely
remove background trajectories from video with camera shaking. Trajectories in
less discriminative regions should be given modest weights in order to create
more discriminative local descriptors for action recognition. In addition, the
two-stream approach, which learns appearance and motion information separately,
cannot focus on motion in important regions when extracting features from
spatial convolutional layers of the appearance network, and vice versa. In
order to address the above mentioned problems, we propose a new local
descriptor that pools a new convolutional layer obtained from crossing two
networks along iDT. This new descriptor is calculated by applying
discriminative weights learned from one network to a convolutional layer of the
other network. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on ordinal
action recognition datasets, 92.3% on UCF101, and 66.2% on HMDB51.

 <dc:title>Closed-form, robust and accurate multi-frequency phase unwrapping:
  frequency design and algorithm</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wei, Li</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Qi, Wangdong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A closed-form algorithm, named &quot;concerto&quot;, is proposed for phase-based
distance estimation in multi-frequency phase unwrapping (MFPU) system. The
concerto method consists of three coherent estimation stages,i.e., initial
modified BW estimation, residual error estimation and LS estimation , each of
which has a closed-form expression and cooperates closely with each other like
a concerto. Due to a specially designed frequency pattern, concerto is
reliable, accurate, and computationally simple. Meanwhile, measurement
frequency selection is an easier task. Performance comparisons with beat
wavelength (BW), excess fractions (EF) and Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)
method confirm that our method outperforms these methods both in accuracy and
reliability and can asymptotically achieve the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB).

 <dc:description>  This paper covers the whole process of developing an Augmented Reality
Stereoscopig Render Engine for the Oculus Rift. To capture the real world in
form of a camera stream, two cameras with fish-eye lenses had to be installed
on the Oculus Rift DK1 hardware. The idea was inspired by Steptoe
\cite{steptoe2014presence}. After the introduction, a theoretical part covers
all the most neccessary elements to achieve an AR System for the Oculus Rift,
following the implementation part where the code from the AR Stereo Engine is
explained in more detail. A short conclusion section shows some results,
reflects some experiences and in the final chapter some future works will be
discussed. The project can be accessed via the git repository

 <dc:description>  Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has already been applied to learn
speaker characterizations from single or non-simultaneous speech for speaker
recognition applications. It is also known for its good performance in (blind)
source separation for simultaneous speech. This paper explains how NMF can be
used to jointly solve the two problems in a multichannel speaker recognizer for
simultaneous speech. It is shown how state-of-the-art multichannel NMF for
blind source separation can be easily extended to incorporate speaker
recognition. Experiments on the CHiME corpus show that this method outperforms
the sequential approach of first applying source separation, followed by
speaker recognition that uses state-of-the-art i-vector techniques.

 <dc:title>The Z-loss: a shift and scale invariant classification loss belonging to
  the Spherical Family</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Despite being the standard loss function to train multi-class neural
networks, the log-softmax has two potential limitations. First, it involves
computations that scale linearly with the number of output classes, which can
restrict the size of problems we are able to tackle with current hardware.
Second, it remains unclear how close it matches the task loss such as the top-k
error rate or other non-differentiable evaluation metrics which we aim to
optimize ultimately. In this paper, we introduce an alternative classification
loss function, the Z-loss, which is designed to address these two issues.
Unlike the log-softmax, it has the desirable property of belonging to the
spherical loss family (Vincent et al., 2015), a class of loss functions for
which training can be performed very efficiently with a complexity independent
of the number of output classes. We show experimentally that it significantly
outperforms the other spherical loss functions previously investigated.
Furthermore, we show on a word language modeling task that it also outperforms
the log-softmax with respect to certain ranking scores, such as top-k scores,
suggesting that the Z-loss has the flexibility to better match the task loss.
These qualities thus makes the Z-loss an appealing candidate to train very
efficiently large output networks such as word-language models or other extreme
classification problems. On the One Billion Word (Chelba et al., 2014) dataset,
we are able to train a model with the Z-loss 40 times faster than the
log-softmax and more than 4 times faster than the hierarchical softmax.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a pattern $w$ and a text $t$, the speed of a pattern matching algorithm
over $t$ with regard to $w$, is the ratio of the length of $t$ to the number of
text accesses performed to search $w$ into $t$. We first propose a general
method for computing the limit of the expected speed of pattern matching
algorithms, with regard to $w$, over iid texts. Next, we show how to determine
the greatest speed which can be achieved among a large class of algorithms,
altogether with an algorithm running this speed. Since the complexity of this
determination make it impossible to deal with patterns of length greater than
4, we propose a polynomial heuristic. Finally, our approaches are compared with
9 pre-existing pattern matching algorithms from both a theoretical and a
practical point of view, i.e. both in terms of limit expected speed on iid
texts, and in terms of observed average speed on real data. In all cases, the
pre-existing algorithms are outperformed.

 <dc:description>  We present a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architecture for the
task of continuous authentication on mobile devices. To deal with the limited
resources of these devices, we reduce the complexity of the networks by
learning intermediate features such as gender and hair color instead of
identities. We present a multi-task, part-based DCNN architecture for attribute
detection that performs better than the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
accuracy. As a byproduct of the proposed architecture, we are able to explore
the embedding space of the attributes extracted from different facial parts,
such as mouth and eyes, to discover new attributes. Furthermore, through
extensive experimentation, we show that the attribute features extracted by our
method outperform the previously presented attribute-based method and a
baseline LBP method for the task of active authentication. Lastly, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in terms of speed
and power consumption by deploying it on an actual mobile device.

 <dc:description>  Grasping an object is a matter of first moving a prehensile organ at some
position in the world, and then managing the contact relationship between the
prehensile organ and the object. Once the contact relationship has been
established and made stable, the object is part of the body and it can move in
the world. As any action, the action of grasping is ontologically anchored in
the physical space while the correlative movement originates in the space of
the body. Evolution has found amazing solutions that allow organisms to rapidly
and efficiently manage the relationship between their body and the world. It is
then natural that roboticists consider taking inspiration of these natural
solutions, while contributing to better understand their origin.

 <dc:description>  Brouwer's constructivist foundations of mathematics is based on an
intuitively meaningful notion of computation shared by all mathematicians.
Martin-L\&quot;of's meaning explanations for constructive type theory define the
concept of a type in terms of computation. Briefly, a type is a complete
(closed) program that evaluates to a canonical type whose members are complete
programs that evaluate to canonical elements of that type. The explanation is
extended to incomplete (open) programs by functionality: types and elements
must respect equality in their free variables. Equality is evidence-free---two
types or elements are at most equal---and equal things are implicitly
interchangeable in all contexts.
  Higher-dimensional type theory extends type theory to account for
identifications of types and elements. An identification witnesses that two
types or elements are explicitly interchangeable in all contexts by an explicit
transport, or coercion, operation. There must be sufficiently many
identifications, which is ensured by imposing a generalized form of the Kan
condition from homotopy theory. Here we provide a Martin-L\&quot;of-style meaning
explanation of simple higher-dimensional type theory based on a programming
language that includes Kan-like constructs witnessing the computational meaning
of the higher structure of types. The treatment includes an example of a higher
inductive type (namely, the 1-dimensional sphere) and an example of Voevodsky's
univalence principle, which identifies equivalent types.
  The main result is a computational canonicity theorem that validates the
computational interpretation: a closed boolean expression must always evaluate
to a boolean value, even in the presence of higher-dimensional structure. This
provides the first fully computational formulation of higher-dimensional type
theory.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the question of computational resources (such as stacks and
counters) necessary to perform radix conversions. To this end it is shown that
no PDA can compute the significand of the best $n$-digit floating point
approximation of a power of an incommensurable radix. This extends the results
of W.~Clinger. We also prove that a two counter machine with input is capable
of such conversions. On the other hand we note a curious asymmetry with respect
to the order in which the digits are input by showing that a two counter
machine can decode its input online if the digits are presented in the
most-to-least significant order while no such machine can decode its input in
this manner if the digits are presented in the least-to-most significant order.
Some structural results about two counter machines (with input) are also
established.

 <dc:description>  Human activity recognition (HAR) in ubiquitous computing is beginning to
adopt deep learning to substitute for well-established analysis techniques that
rely on hand-crafted feature extraction and classification techniques. From
these isolated applications of custom deep architectures it is, however,
difficult to gain an overview of their suitability for problems ranging from
the recognition of manipulative gestures to the segmentation and identification
of physical activities like running or ascending stairs. In this paper we
rigorously explore deep, convolutional, and recurrent approaches across three
representative datasets that contain movement data captured with wearable
sensors. We describe how to train recurrent approaches in this setting,
introduce a novel regularisation approach, and illustrate how they outperform
the state-of-the-art on a large benchmark dataset. Across thousands of
recognition experiments with randomly sampled model configurations we
investigate the suitability of each model for different tasks in HAR, explore
the impact of hyperparameters using the fANOVA framework, and provide
guidelines for the practitioner who wants to apply deep learning in their
problem setting.

 <dc:description>  In a range of scientific coauthorship networks, transitions emerge in degree
distributions, correlations between degrees and local clustering coefficients,
etc. The existence of those transitions could be regarded as a result of the
diversity in collaboration behaviours of scientific fields. A growing geometric
hypergraph built on a cluster of concentric circles is proposed to model two
specific collaboration behaviours, namely the behaviour of leaders and that of
other members in research teams. The model successfully predicts the
transitions, as well as many common features of coauthorship networks.
Particulary, it realizes a process of deriving the complex &quot;scale-free&quot;
property from the simple &quot;yes/no&quot; experiments. Moreover, it gives a reasonable
explanation for the emergence of transitions with the difference of
collaboration behaviours between leaders and other members. The difference
emerges in the evolution of research teams, which synthetically addresses
several specific factors of generating collaborations, namely the
communications between research teams, the academic impacts and homophily of
authors.

 <dc:description>  Image representations derived from pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) have become the new state of the art in computer vision tasks such as
instance retrieval. This work explores the suitability for instance retrieval
of image- and region-wise representations pooled from an object detection CNN
such as Faster R-CNN. We take advantage of the object proposals learned by a
Region Proposal Network (RPN) and their associated CNN features to build an
instance search pipeline composed of a first filtering stage followed by a
spatial reranking. We further investigate the suitability of Faster R-CNN
features when the network is fine-tuned for the same objects one wants to
retrieve. We assess the performance of our proposed system with the Oxford
Buildings 5k, Paris Buildings 6k and a subset of TRECVid Instance Search 2013,
achieving competitive results.

 <dc:description>  Indexing highly repetitive collections has become a relevant problem with the
emergence of large repositories of versioned documents, among other
applications. These collections may reach huge sizes, but are formed mostly of
documents that are near-copies of others. Traditional techniques for indexing
these collections fail to properly exploit their regularities in order to
reduce space.
  We introduce new techniques for compressing inverted indexes that exploit
this near-copy regularity. They are based on run-length, Lempel-Ziv, or grammar
compression of the differential inverted lists, instead of the usual practice
of gap-encoding them. We show that, in this highly repetitive setting, our
compression methods significantly reduce the space obtained with classical
techniques, at the price of moderate slowdowns. Moreover, our best methods are
universal, that is, they do not need to know the versioning structure of the
collection, nor that a clear versioning structure even exists.
  We also introduce compressed self-indexes in the comparison. These are
designed for general strings (not only natural language texts) and represent
the text collection plus the index structure (not an inverted index) in
integrated form. We show that these techniques can compress much further, using
a small fraction of the space required by our new inverted indexes. Yet, they
are orders of magnitude slower.

 <dc:description>  The number of linked data sources and the size of the linked open data graph
keep growing every day. As a consequence, semantic RDF services are more and
more confronted to various &quot;big data&quot; problems. Query processing is one of them
and needs to be efficiently addressed with executions over scalable, highly
available and fault tolerant frameworks. Data management systems requiring
these properties are rarely built from scratch but are rather designed on top
of an existing cluster computing engine. In this work, we consider the
processing of SPARQL queries with Apache Spark. We propose and compare five
different query processing approaches based on different join execution models
and Spark components. A detailed experimentation, on real-world and synthetic
data sets, emphasizes that two approaches tailored for the RDF data model
outperform the other ones on all major query shapes, i.e., star, snowflake,
chain and hybrid.

 <dc:description>  We consider the provision of public goods on networks of strategic agents. We
study different effort outcomes of these network games, namely, the Nash
equilibria, Pareto efficient effort profiles, and semi-cooperative equilibria
(effort profiles resulting from interactions among coalitions of agents). We
identify necessary and sufficient conditions on the structure of the network
for the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. We show that our finding unifies
(and strengthens) existing results in the literature. We also identify
conditions for the existence of Nash equilibria for the subclasses of games at
the two extremes of our model, namely games of strategic complements and games
of strategic substitutes. We provide a graph-theoretical interpretation of
agents' efforts at the Nash equilibrium, as well as the Pareto efficient
outcomes and semi-cooperative equilibria, by linking an agent's decision to her
centrality in the interaction network. Using this connection, we separate the
effects of incoming and outgoing edges on agents' efforts and uncover an
alternating effect over walks of different length in the network.

 <dc:description>  Parallel and monolithic 3D integration directions offer pathways to realize
3D integrated circuits (ICs) but still lead to layer-by-layer implementations,
each functional layer being composed in 2D first. This mindset causes
challenging connectivity, routing and layer alignment between layers when
connected in 3D, with a routing access that can be even worse than 2D CMOS,
which fundamentally limits their potential. To fully exploit the opportunities
in the third dimension, we propose Skybridge-3D-CMOS (S3DC), a fine-grained 3D
integration approach that is directly composed in 3D, utilizing the vertical
dimension vs. using a layer-by-layer assembly mindset. S3DC uses a novel wafer
fabric creation with direct 3D design and connectivity in the vertical
dimension. It builds on a uniform vertical nanowire template that is processed
as a single wafer; it incorporates specifically architected structures for
realizing devices, circuits, and heat management directly in 3D. Novel 3D
interconnect concepts, including within the silicon layers, enable
significantly improved routing flexibility in all three dimensions and a
high-density 3D design paradigm overall. Intrinsic components for fabric-level
3D heat management are introduced. Extensive bottom-up simulations and
experiments have been presented to validate the key fabric-enabling concepts.
Evaluation results indicate up to 40x density and 10x performance-per-watt
benefits against conventional 16-nm CMOS for the circuits studied; benefits are
also at least an order of magnitude beyond what was shown to be possible with
other 3D directions.

 <dc:title>A Predictor-based Attitude and Position Estimation for Rigid Bodies
  Moving in Planar Space by using Delayed Landmark Measurements</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Senejohnny, Danial</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Namvar, Mehrzad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a globally and exponentially convergent predictive
observer for attitude and position estimation based on landmark measurements
and velocity (angular and linear) readings. It is assumed that landmark
measurements are available with time-delay. The maximum value of the sensor
delay under which the estimation error converges to zero is calculated.
Synthesis of the observer is based on a representation of rigid-body kinematics
and sensor delay, formulated via ordinary and partial differential equations
(ODE-PDE). Observability condition specifies necessary and sufficient landmark
configuration for convergence of attitude and position estimation error to
zero. Finally, for implementation purposes, a PDE-free realization of the
predictive observer is proposed. Simulation results are presented to
demonstrate performance and convergence properties of the predictive observer
in case of a wheeled mobile robot.

 <dc:title>An expressive dissimilarity measure for relational clustering using

 <dc:description>  Clustering is an underspecified task: there are no universal criteria for
what makes a good clustering. This is especially true for relational data,
where similarity can be based on the features of individuals, the relationships
between them, or a mix of both. Existing methods for relational clustering have
strong and often implicit biases in this respect. In this paper, we introduce a
novel similarity measure for relational data. It is the first measure to
incorporate a wide variety of types of similarity, including similarity of
attributes, similarity of relational context, and proximity in a hypergraph. We
experimentally evaluate how using this similarity affects the quality of
clustering on very different types of datasets. The experiments demonstrate
that (a) using this similarity in standard clustering methods consistently
gives good results, whereas other measures work well only on datasets that
match their bias; and (b) on most datasets, the novel similarity outperforms
even the best among the existing ones.

 <dc:description>  Constructor rewriting systems are said to be cons-free if, roughly,
constructor terms in the right-hand sides of rules are subterms of constructor
terms in the left-hand side; the computational intuition is that rules cannot
build new data structures. It is well-known that cons-free programming
languages can be used to characterize computational complexity classes, and
that cons-free first-order term rewriting can be used to characterize the set
of polynomial-time decidable sets.
  We investigate cons-free higher-order term rewriting systems, the complexity
classes they characterize, and how these depend on the order of the types used
in the systems. We prove that, for every k $\geq$ 1, left-linear cons-free
systems with type order k characterize E$^k$TIME if arbitrary evaluation is
used (i.e., the system does not have a fixed reduction strategy).
  The main difference with prior work in implicit complexity is that (i) our
results hold for non-orthogonal term rewriting systems with possible rule
overlaps with no assumptions about reduction strategy, (ii) results for such
term rewriting systems have previously only been obtained for k = 1, and with
additional syntactic restrictions on top of cons-freeness and left-linearity.
  Our results are apparently among the first implicit characterizations of the
hierarchy E = E$^1$TIME $\subseteq$ E$^2$TIME $\subseteq$ .... Our work
confirms prior results that having full non-determinism (via overlaps of rules)
does not directly allow characterization of non-deterministic complexity
classes like NE. We also show that non-determinism makes the classes
characterized highly sensitive to minor syntactic changes such as admitting
product types or non-left-linear rules.

 <dc:description>  Full duplex (FD) communications has the potential to double the capacity of a
half duplex (HD) system at the link level. However, in a cellular network, FD
operation is not a straightforward extension of half duplex operations. The
increased interference due to a large number of simultaneous transmissions in
FD operation and realtime traffic conditions limits the capacity improvement.
Realizing the potential of FD requires careful coordination of resource
allocation among the cells as well as within the cell. In this paper, we
propose a distributed resource allocation, i.e., joint user selection and power
allocation for a FD multi-cell system, assuming FD base stations (BSs) and HD
user equipment (UEs). Due to the complexity of finding the globally optimum
solution, a sub-optimal solution for UE selection, and a novel geometric
programming based solution for power allocation, are proposed. The proposed
distributed approach converges quickly and performs almost as well as a
centralized solution, but with much lower signaling overhead. It provides a
hybrid scheduling policy which allows FD operations whenever it is
advantageous, but otherwise defaults to HD operation. We focus on small cell
systems because they are more suitable for FD operation, given practical
self-interference cancellation limits.With practical self-interference
cancellation, it is shown that the proposed hybrid FD system achieves nearly
two times throughput improvement for an indoor multi-cell scenario, and about
65% improvement for an outdoor multi-cell scenario compared to the HD system.

 <dc:title>On the Complexity of Solving Zero-Dimensional Polynomial Systems via

 <dc:description>  Given a zero-dimensional polynomial system consisting of n integer
polynomials in n variables, we propose a certified and complete method to
compute all complex solutions of the system as well as a corresponding
separating linear form l with coefficients of small bit size. For computing l,
we need to project the solutions into one dimension along O(n) distinct
directions but no further algebraic manipulations. The solutions are then
directly reconstructed from the considered projections. The first step is
deterministic, whereas the second step uses randomization, thus being
Las-Vegas.
  The theoretical analysis of our approach shows that the overall cost for the
two problems considered above is dominated by the cost of carrying out the
projections. We also give bounds on the bit complexity of our algorithms that
are exclusively stated in terms of the number of variables, the total degree
and the bitsize of the input polynomials.

 <dc:description>  Predicting trends in stock market prices has been an area of interest for
researchers for many years due to its complex and dynamic nature. Intrinsic
volatility in stock market across the globe makes the task of prediction
challenging. Forecasting and diffusion modeling, although effective can't be
the panacea to the diverse range of problems encountered in prediction,
short-term or otherwise. Market risk, strongly correlated with forecasting
errors, needs to be minimized to ensure minimal risk in investment. The authors
propose to minimize forecasting error by treating the forecasting problem as a
classification problem, a popular suite of algorithms in Machine learning. In
this paper, we propose a novel way to minimize the risk of investment in stock
market by predicting the returns of a stock using a class of powerful machine
learning algorithms known as ensemble learning. Some of the technical
indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), stochastic oscillator etc are
used as inputs to train our model. The learning model used is an ensemble of
multiple decision trees. The algorithm is shown to outperform existing algo-
rithms found in the literature. Out of Bag (OOB) error estimates have been
found to be encouraging. Key Words: Random Forest Classifier, stock price
forecasting, Exponential smoothing, feature extraction, OOB error and
convergence.

 <dc:description>  Since microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene
regulation, miRNA identification is one of the most essential problems in
computational biology. miRNAs are usually short in length ranging between 20
and 23 base pairs. It is thus often difficult to distinguish miRNA-encoding
sequences from other non-coding RNAs and pseudo miRNAs that have a similar
length, and most previous studies have recommended using precursor miRNAs
instead of mature miRNAs for robust detection. A great number of conventional
machine-learning-based classification methods have been proposed, but they
often have the serious disadvantage of requiring manual feature engineering,
and their performance is limited as well. In this paper, we propose a novel
miRNA precursor prediction algorithm, deepMiRGene, based on recurrent neural
networks, specifically long short-term memory networks. deepMiRGene
automatically learns suitable features from the data themselves without manual
feature engineering and constructs a model that can successfully reflect
structural characteristics of precursor miRNAs. For the performance evaluation
of our approach, we have employed several widely used evaluation metrics on
three recent benchmark datasets and verified that deepMiRGene delivered
comparable performance among the current state-of-the-art tools.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many axiomatic definitions of entropy, such as the R\'enyi entropy, of a
random variable are closely related to the $\ell_{\alpha}$-norm of its
probability distribution. This study considers probability distributions on
finite sets, and examines the sharp bounds of the $\ell_{\beta}$-norm with a
fixed $\ell_{\alpha}$-norm, $\alpha \neq \beta$, for $n$-dimensional
probability vectors with an integer $n \ge 2$. From the results, we derive the
sharp bounds of the R\'enyi entropy of positive order $\beta$ with a fixed
R\'enyi entropy of another positive order $\alpha$. As applications, we
investigate sharp bounds of Ariomoto's mutual information of order $\alpha$ and
Gallager's random coding exponents for uniformly focusing channels under the
uniform input distribution.

 <dc:description>  This work presents a novel framework for the formation control of multiple
autonomous ground vehicles in an on-road environment. Unique challenges of this
problem lie in 1) the design of collision avoidance strategies with obstacles
and with other vehicles in a highly structured environment, 2) dynamic
reconfiguration of the formation to handle different task specifications. In
this paper, we design a local MPC-based tracking controller for each individual
vehicle to follow a reference trajectory while satisfying various constraints
(kinematics and dynamics, collision avoidance, \textit{etc.}). The reference
trajectory of a vehicle is computed from its leader's trajectory, based on a
pre-defined formation tree. We use logic rules to organize the collision
avoidance behaviors of member vehicles. Moreover, we propose a methodology to
safely reconfigure the formation on-the-fly. The proposed framework has been
validated using high-fidelity simulations.

 <dc:description>  Multi-atlas segmentation is a widely used tool in medical image analysis,
providing robust and accurate results by learning from annotated atlas
datasets. However, the availability of fully annotated atlas images for
training is limited due to the time required for the labelling task.
Segmentation methods requiring only a proportion of each atlas image to be
labelled could therefore reduce the workload on expert raters tasked with
annotating atlas images. To address this issue, we first re-examine the
labelling problem common in many existing approaches and formulate its solution
in terms of a Markov Random Field energy minimisation problem on a graph
connecting atlases and the target image. This provides a unifying framework for
multi-atlas segmentation. We then show how modifications in the graph
configuration of the proposed framework enable the use of partially annotated
atlas images and investigate different partial annotation strategies. The
proposed method was evaluated on two Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets
for hippocampal and cardiac segmentation. Experiments were performed aimed at
(1) recreating existing segmentation techniques with the proposed framework and
(2) demonstrating the potential of employing sparsely annotated atlas data for
multi-atlas segmentation.

 <dc:description>  Wiatowski and B\&quot;olcskei, 2015, proved that deformation stability and
vertical translation invariance of deep convolutional neural network-based
feature extractors are guaranteed by the network structure per se rather than
the specific convolution kernels and non-linearities. While the translation
invariance result applies to square-integrable functions, the deformation
stability bound holds for band-limited functions only. Many signals of
practical relevance (such as natural images) exhibit, however, sharp and curved
discontinuities and are hence not band-limited. The main contribution of this
paper is a deformation stability result that takes these structural properties
into account. Specifically, we establish deformation stability bounds for the
class of cartoon functions introduced by Donoho, 2001.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present the development of a modulated web based statistical
system, hereafter MWStat, which shifts the statistical paradigm of analyzing
data into a real time structure. The MWStat system is useful for both online
storage data and questionnaires analysis, as well as to provide real time
disposal of results from analysis related to several statistical methodologies
in a customizable fashion. Overall, it can be seem as a useful technical
solution that can be applied to a large range of statistical applications,
which needs of a scheme of devolution of real time results, accessible to
anyone with internet access. We display here the step-by-step instructions for
implementing the system. The structure is accessible, built with an easily
interpretable language and it can be strategically applied to online
statistical applications. We rely on the relationship of several free
languages, namely, PHP, R, MySQL database and an Apache HTTP server, and on the
use of software tools such as phpMyAdmin. We expose three didactical examples
of the MWStat system on institutional evaluation, statistical quality control
and multivariate analysis. The methodology is also illustrated in a real
example on institutional evaluation.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of estimating a sparse low-rank matrix from its noisy
observation. We propose an objective function consisting of a data-fidelity
term and two parameterized non-convex penalty functions. Further, we show how
to set the parameters of the non-convex penalty functions, in order to ensure
that the objective function is strictly convex. The proposed objective function
better estimates sparse low-rank matrices than a convex method which utilizes
the sum of the nuclear norm and the $\ell_1$ norm. We derive an algorithm (as
an instance of ADMM) to solve the proposed problem, and guarantee its
convergence provided the scalar augmented Lagrangian parameter is set
appropriately. We demonstrate the proposed method for denoising an audio signal
and an adjacency matrix representing protein interactions in the `Escherichia
coli' bacteria.

 <dc:description>  Conventional 2D CMOS technology is reaching fundamental scaling limits, and
interconnect bottleneck is dominating integrated circuit (IC) power and
performance. While 3D IC technologies using Through Silicon Via or Monolithic
Inter-layer Via alleviate some of these challenges, they follow a similar
layout and routing mindset as 2D CMOS. This is insufficient to address routing
requirements in high-density 3D ICs and even causes severe routing congestion
at large-scale designs, limiting their benefits and scalability. Skybridge is a
recently proposed fine-grained 3D IC fabric relying on vertical nanowires that
presents a paradigm shift for scaling, while addressing associated 3D
connectivity and manufacturability challenges. Skybridge's core fabric
components enable a new 3D IC design approach with vertically-composed logic
gates, and provide a greater degree of routing flexibility compared to
conventional 2D and 3D ICs leading to much larger benefits and future
scalability. In this paper, we present a methodology using relevant metrics to
evaluate and quantify the benefits of Skybridge vs. state-of-the-art
transistor-level monolithic 3D IC (T-MI) and 2D in terms of routability and its
impact on large-scale circuits. This is enabled by a new device-to-system
design flow with commercial CAD tools that we developed for large-scale
Skybridge IC designs in 16nm node. Evaluation for standard benchmark circuits
shows that Skybridge yields up to 1.6x lower routing demand against T-MI with
no routing congestion (routing demand to resource ratio &lt; 1) at all metal
layers. This 3D routability in conjunction with compact vertical gate design in
Skybridge translate into benefits of up to 3x lower power and 11x higher
density over 2D CMOS, while TLM-3DIC approach only has up to 22% power saving
and 2x density improvement over 2D CMOS.

simultaneously and constructs a feedforward signal based on a known regressor.
An improved version of the proposed algorithm to avoid matrix inversion and

 <dc:description>  An increasing number of computer vision tasks can be tackled with deep
features, which are the intermediate outputs of a pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Network. Despite the astonishing performance, deep features extracted
from low-level neurons are still below satisfaction, arguably because they
cannot access the spatial context contained in the higher layers. In this
paper, we present InterActive, a novel algorithm which computes the activeness
of neurons and network connections. Activeness is propagated through a neural
network in a top-down manner, carrying high-level context and improving the
descriptive power of low-level and mid-level neurons. Visualization indicates
that neuron activeness can be interpreted as spatial-weighted neuron responses.
We achieve state-of-the-art classification performance on a wide range of image
datasets.

 <dc:description>  During a long period of time we are combating over-fitting in the CNN
training process with model regularization, including weight decay, model
averaging, data augmentation, etc. In this paper, we present DisturbLabel, an
extremely simple algorithm which randomly replaces a part of labels as
incorrect values in each iteration. Although it seems weird to intentionally
generate incorrect training labels, we show that DisturbLabel prevents the
network training from over-fitting by implicitly averaging over exponentially
many networks which are trained with different label sets. To the best of our
knowledge, DisturbLabel serves as the first work which adds noises on the loss
layer. Meanwhile, DisturbLabel cooperates well with Dropout to provide
complementary regularization functions. Experiments demonstrate competitive
recognition results on several popular image recognition datasets.

 <dc:description>  The emerging Internet of Things (IoT)-driven ultra-dense small cell networks
(UD-SCNs) will need to combat a variety of challenges. On one hand, massive
number of devices sharing the limited wireless resources will render
centralized control mechanisms infeasible due to the excessive cost of
information acquisition and computations. On the other hand, to reduce energy
consumption from fixed power grid and/or battery, many IoT devices may need to
depend on the energy harvested from the ambient environment (e.g., from RF
transmissions, environmental sources). However, due to the opportunistic nature
of energy harvesting, this will introduce uncertainty in the network operation.
In this article, we study the distributed cell association problem for energy
harvesting IoT devices in UD-SCNs. After reviewing the state-of-the-art
research on the cell association problem in small cell networks, we outline the
major challenges for distributed cell association in IoT-driven UD-SCNs where
the IoT devices will need to perform cell association in a distributed manner
in presence of uncertainty (e.g., limited knowledge on channel/network) and
limited computational capabilities. To this end, we propose an approach based
on mean-field multi-armed bandit games to solve the uplink cell association
problem for energy harvesting IoT devices in a UD-SCN. This approach is
particularly suitable to analyze large multi-agent systems under uncertainty
and lack of information. We provide some theoretical results as well as
preliminary performance evaluation results for the proposed approach.

 <dc:title>Strongly Refuting Random CSPs Below the Spectral Threshold</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Random constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are known to exhibit threshold
phenomena: given a uniformly random instance of a CSP with $n$ variables and
$m$ clauses, there is a value of $m = \Omega(n)$ beyond which the CSP will be
unsatisfiable with high probability. Strong refutation is the problem of
certifying that no variable assignment satisfies more than a constant fraction
of clauses; this is the natural algorithmic problem in the unsatisfiable regime
(when $m/n = \omega(1)$).
  Intuitively, strong refutation should become easier as the clause density
$m/n$ grows, because the contradictions introduced by the random clauses become
more locally apparent. For CSPs such as $k$-SAT and $k$-XOR, there is a
long-standing gap between the clause density at which efficient strong
refutation algorithms are known, $m/n \ge \widetilde O(n^{k/2-1})$, and the
clause density at which instances become unsatisfiable with high probability,
$m/n = \omega (1)$.
  In this paper, we give spectral and sum-of-squares algorithms for strongly
refuting random $k$-XOR instances with clause density $m/n \ge \widetilde
O(n^{(k/2-1)(1-\delta)})$ in time $\exp(\widetilde O(n^{\delta}))$ or in
$\widetilde O(n^{\delta})$ rounds of the sum-of-squares hierarchy, for any
$\delta \in [0,1)$ and any integer $k \ge 3$. Our algorithms provide a smooth
transition between the clause density at which polynomial-time algorithms are
known at $\delta = 0$, and brute-force refutation at the satisfiability
threshold when $\delta = 1$. We also leverage our $k$-XOR results to obtain
strong refutation algorithms for SAT (or any other Boolean CSP) at similar
clause densities. Our algorithms match the known sum-of-squares lower bounds
due to Grigoriev and Schonebeck, up to logarithmic factors.
  Additionally, we extend our techniques to give new results for certifying
upper bounds on the injective tensor norm of random tensors.

 <dc:description>  Large-scale graph-structured data arising from social networks, databases,
knowledge bases, web graphs, etc. is now available for analysis and mining.
Graph-mining often involves 'relationship queries', which seek a ranked list of
interesting interconnections among a given set of entities, corresponding to
nodes in the graph. While relationship queries have been studied for many
years, using various terminologies, e.g., keyword-search, Steiner-tree in a
graph etc., the solutions proposed in the literature so far have not focused on
scaling relationship queries to large graphs having billions of nodes and
edges, such are now publicly available in the form of 'linked-open-data'. In
this paper, we present an algorithm for distributed keyword search (DKS) on
large graphs, based on the graph-parallel computing paradigm Pregel. We also
present an analytical proof that our algorithm produces an optimally ranked
list of answers if run to completion. Even if terminated early, our algorithm
produces approximate answers along with bounds. We describe an optimized
implementation of our DKS algorithm along with time-complexity analysis.
Finally, we report and analyze experiments using an implementation of DKS on
Giraph the graph-parallel computing framework based on Pregel, and demonstrate
that we can efficiently process relationship queries on large-scale subsets of
linked-open-data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study novel neural network structures to better model long
term dependency in sequential data. We propose to use more memory units to keep
track of more preceding states in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are
all recurrently fed to the hidden layers as feedback through different weighted
paths. By extending the popular recurrent structure in RNNs, we provide the
models with better short-term memory mechanism to learn long term dependency in
sequences. Analogous to digital filters in signal processing, we call these
structures as higher order RNNs (HORNNs). Similar to RNNs, HORNNs can also be
learned using the back-propagation through time method. HORNNs are generally
applicable to a variety of sequence modelling tasks. In this work, we have
examined HORNNs for the language modeling task using two popular data sets,
namely the Penn Treebank (PTB) and English text8 data sets. Experimental
results have shown that the proposed HORNNs yield the state-of-the-art
performance on both data sets, significantly outperforming the regular RNNs as
well as the popular LSTMs.

 <dc:description>  Emergency evacuation is the process of movement of people away from the
threat or actual occurrence of hazards such as natural disasters, terrorist
attacks, fires and bombs. In this paper, we focus on evacuation from a
building, but the ideas can be applied to city and region evacuation. We define
the problem and show how it can be modeled using graphs. The resulting
optimization problem can be formulated as an integer linear program. Though
this can be solved exactly, this approach does not scale well for graphs with
thousands of nodes and several hundred thousands of edges. This is impractical
for large graphs.
  We study a special case of this problem, where there is only a single source
and a single sink. For this case, we give an improved algorithm \emph{Single
Source Single Sink Evacuation Route Planner (SSEP)}, whose evacuation time is
always at most that of a famous algorithm \emph{Capacity Constrained Route
Planner (CCRP)}, and whose running time is strictly less than that of CCRP. We
prove this mathematically and give supporting results by extensive experiments.
We also study randomized behavior model of people and give some interesting
results.

 <dc:description>  The continuous interest in the social network area contributes to the fast
development of this field. The new possibilities of obtaining and storing data
facilitate deeper analysis of the entire social network, extracted social
groups and single individuals as well. One of the most interesting research
topic is the network dynamics and dynamics of social groups in particular, it
means analysis of group evolution over time. It is the natural step forward
after social community extraction. Having communities extracted, appropriate
knowledge and methods for dynamic analysis may be applied in order to identify
changes as well as to predict the future of all or some selected groups.
Furthermore, knowing the most probably change of a given group some additional
steps may be performed in order to change this predicted future according to
specific needs. Such ability would be a powerful tool in the hands of human
resource managers, personnel recruitment, marketing, telecommunication
companies, etc.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates into the colorization problem which converts a
grayscale image to a colorful version. This is a very difficult problem and
normally requires manual adjustment to achieve artifact-free quality. For
instance, it normally requires human-labelled color scribbles on the grayscale
target image or a careful selection of colorful reference images (e.g.,
capturing the same scene in the grayscale target image). Unlike the previous
methods, this paper aims at a high-quality fully-automatic colorization method.
With the assumption of a perfect patch matching technique, the use of an
extremely large-scale reference database (that contains sufficient color
images) is the most reliable solution to the colorization problem. However,
patch matching noise will increase with respect to the size of the reference
database in practice. Inspired by the recent success in deep learning
techniques which provide amazing modeling of large-scale data, this paper
re-formulates the colorization problem so that deep learning techniques can be
directly employed. To ensure artifact-free quality, a joint bilateral filtering
based post-processing step is proposed. We further develop an adaptive image
clustering technique to incorporate the global image information. Numerous
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-art algorithms
both in terms of quality and speed.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the distributed optimization of a sum of locally
observable, non-convex functions. The optimization is performed over a
multi-agent networked system, and each local function depends only on a subset
of the variables. An asynchronous and distributed alternating directions method
of multipliers (ADMM) method that allows the nodes to defer or skip the
computation and transmission of updates is proposed in the paper. The proposed
algorithm utilizes different approximations in the update step, resulting in
proximal and majorized ADMM variants. Both variants are shown to converge to a
local minimum, under certain regularity conditions. The proposed asynchronous
algorithms are also applied to the problem of cooperative localization in
wireless ad hoc networks, where it is shown to outperform the other
state-of-the-art localization algorithms.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we aim at developing scalable neural network-type learning
systems. Motivated by the idea of &quot;constructive neural networks&quot; in
approximation theory, we focus on &quot;constructing&quot; rather than &quot;training&quot;
feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) for learning, and propose a novel FNNs
learning system called the constructive feed-forward neural network (CFN).
Theoretically, we prove that the proposed method not only overcomes the
classical saturation problem for FNN approximation, but also reaches the
optimal learning rate when the regression function is smooth, while the
state-of-the-art learning rates established for traditional FNNs are only near
optimal (up to a logarithmic factor). A series of numerical simulations are
provided to show the efficiency and feasibility of CFN via comparing with the
well-known regularized least squares (RLS) with Gaussian kernel and extreme
learning machine (ELM).

 <dc:description>  Massive MIMO brings both motivations and challenges to develop the 5th
generation Mobile wireless technology. The promising number of users and the
high bitrate offered per unit area are challenged by uplink pilot contamination
due to pilot reuse and a limited number of orthogonal pilot sequences. This
paper proposes a solution to mitigate uplink pilot contamination in an indoor
scenario where multi-cell share the same pool of pilot sequences, that are
supposed to be less than the number of users. This can be done by reducing
uplink pilots using Channel State Information (CSI) prediction. The proposed
method is based on machine learning approach, where a quantized version of
Channel State Information (QCSI) is learned during estimation session and
stored at the Base Station (BS) to be exploited for future CSI prediction. The
learned QCSI are represented by a weighted directed graph, which is responsible
to monitor and predict the CSI of User Terminals (UTs) in the local cell. We
introduce an online learning algorithm to create and update this graph which we
call CSI map. Simulation results show an increase in the downlink sum-rate and
a significant feedback reduction.

 <dc:description>  Cloud Computing is an Internet based computing, whereby shared resources,
software and information, are provided to computers and devices on demand, like
the electricity grid. Currently, IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS
(Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) are used as a business
model for Cloud Computing. Nowadays, the adoption and deployment of Cloud
Computing is increasing in various domains, forcing researchers to conduct
research in the area of Cloud Computing globally. Setting up the research
environment is critical for the researchers in the developing countries to
evaluate the research outputs. Currently, modeling, simulation technology and
access of resources from various university data centers has become a useful
and powerful tool in cloud computing research. Several cloud simulators have
been specifically developed by various universities to carry out Cloud
Computing research, including CloudSim, SPECI, Green Cloud and Future Systems
(the Indiana University machines India, Bravo, Delta, Echo and Foxtrot)
supports leading edge data science research and a broad range of
computing-enabled education as well as integration of ideas from cloud and HPC
systems. In this paper, the features, suitability, adaptability and the
learning curve of the existing Cloud Computing simulators and Future Systems
are reviewed and analyzed.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study graph problems in dynamic streaming model, where the
input is defined by a sequence of edge insertions and deletions. As many
natural problems require $\Omega(n)$ space, where $n$ is the number of
vertices, existing works mainly focused on designing $\tilde{O}(n)$ space
algorithms. Although sublinear in the number of edges for dense graphs, it
could still be too large for many applications (e.g. $n$ is huge or the graph
is sparse). In this work, we give single-pass algorithms beating this space
barrier for two classes of problems.
  We present $o(n)$ space algorithms for estimating the number of connected
components with additive error $\varepsilon n$ and
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximating the weight of minimum spanning tree, for any
small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$. The latter improves previous $\tilde{O}(n)$
space algorithm given by Ahn et al. (SODA 2012) for connected graphs with
bounded edge weights.
  We initiate the study of approximate graph property testing in the dynamic
streaming model, where we want to distinguish graphs satisfying the property
from graphs that are $\varepsilon$-far from having the property. We consider
the problem of testing $k$-edge connectivity, $k$-vertex connectivity,
cycle-freeness and bipartiteness (of planar graphs), for which, we provide
algorithms using roughly $\tilde{O}(n^{1-\varepsilon})$ space, which is $o(n)$
for any constant $\varepsilon$.
  To complement our algorithms, we present $\Omega(n^{1-O(\varepsilon)})$ space
lower bounds for these problems, which show that such a dependence on
$\varepsilon$ is necessary.

 <dc:description>  We consider incorporating topic information into message-response matching to
boost responses with rich content in retrieval-based chatbots. To this end, we
propose a topic-aware convolutional neural tensor network (TACNTN). In TACNTN,
matching between a message and a response is not only conducted between a
message vector and a response vector generated by convolutional neural
networks, but also leverages extra topic information encoded in two topic
vectors. The two topic vectors are linear combinations of topic words of the
message and the response respectively, where the topic words are obtained from
a pre-trained LDA model and their weights are determined by themselves as well
as the message vector and the response vector. The message vector, the response
vector, and the two topic vectors are fed to neural tensors to calculate a
matching score. Empirical study on a public data set and a human annotated data
set shows that TACNTN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods for
message-response matching.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a social group utility maximization (SGUM)
framework for cooperative wireless networking that takes into account both
social relationships and physical coupling among users. We show that this
framework provides rich modeling flexibility and spans the continuum between
non-cooperative game and network utility maximization (NUM) -- two
traditionally disjoint paradigms for network optimization. Based on this
framework, we study three important applications of SGUM, in database assisted
spectrum access, power control, and random access control, respectively. For
the case of database assisted spectrum access, we show that the SGUM game is a
potential game and always admits a socially-aware Nash equilibrium (SNE). We
develop a randomized distributed spectrum access algorithm that can
asymptotically converge to the optimal SNE, derive upper bounds on the
convergence time, and also quantify the trade-off between the performance and
convergence time of the algorithm. We further show that the performance gap of
SNE by the algorithm from the NUM solution decreases as the strength of social
ties among users increases and the performance gap is zero when the strengths
of social ties among users reach the maximum values. For the cases of power
control and random access control, we show that there exists a unique SNE.
Furthermore, as the strength of social ties increases from the minimum to the
maximum, a player's SNE strategy migrates from the Nash equilibrium strategy in
a standard non-cooperative game to the socially-optimal strategy in network
utility maximization. Furthermore, we show that the SGUM framework can be
generalized to take into account both positive and negative social ties among
users and can be a useful tool for studying network security problems.

 <dc:description>  The discriminator of an integer sequence s = (s(i))_{i &gt;=0}, introduced by
Arnold, Benkoski, and McCabe in 1985, is the map D_s(n) that sends n &gt;= 1 to
the least positive integer m such that the n numbers s(0), s(1), ..., s(n-1)
are pairwise incongruent modulo m. In this note we consider the discriminators
of a certain class of sequences, the k-regular sequences. We compute the
discriminators of two such sequences, the so-called &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;odious&quot;
numbers, and show they are 2-regular. We also give an example of a k-regular
sequence whose discriminator is not k-regular.
  Finally, we examine sequences that are their own discriminators, and count
the number of length-$n$ finite sequences with this property.

 <dc:description>  This work presents the application of the artificial neural networks, trained
and structurally optimized by genetic algorithms, for modeling of crude
distillation process at PKN ORLEN S.A. refinery. Models for the main
fractionator distillation column products were developed using historical data.
Quality of the fractions were predicted based on several chosen process
variables. The performance of the model was validated using test data. Neural
networks used in companion with genetic algorithms proved that they can
accurately predict fractions quality shifts, reproducing the results of the
standard laboratory analysis. Simple knowledge extraction method from neural
network model built was also performed. Genetic algorithms can be successfully
utilized in efficient training of large neural networks and finding their
optimal structures.

 <dc:description>  The millimeter wave frequencies (roughly above 10 GHz) offer the availability
of massive bandwidth to greatly increase the capacity of fifth generation (5G)
cellular wireless systems. However, to overcome the high isotropic pathloss at
these frequencies, highly directional transmissions will be required at both
the base station (BS) and the mobile user equipment (UE) to establish
sufficient link budget in wide area networks. This reliance on directionality
has important implications for control layer procedures. Initial access in
particular can be significantly delayed due to the need for the BS and the UE
to find the initial directions of transmission. This paper provides a survey of
several recently proposed techniques. Detection probability and delay analysis
is performed to compare various techniques including exhaustive and iterative
search. We show that the optimal strategy depends on the target SNR regime.

 <dc:description>  The millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies offer the potential of orders of
magnitude increases in capacity for next-generation cellular wireless systems.
However, links in mmWave networks are highly susceptible to blocking and may
suffer from rapid variations in quality. Connectivity to multiple cells - both
in the mmWave and in the traditional lower frequencies - is thus considered
essential for robust connectivity. However, one of the challenges in supporting
multi-connectivity in the mmWave space is the requirement for the network to
track the direction of each link in addition to its power and timing. With
highly directional beams and fast varying channels, this directional tracking
may be the main bottleneck in realizing robust mmWave networks. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes a novel measurement system based on (i) the UE
transmitting sounding signals in directions that sweep the angular space, (ii)
the mmWave cells measuring the instantaneous received signal strength along
with its variance to better capture the dynamics and, consequently, the
reliability of a channel/direction and, finally, (iii) a centralized controller
making handover and scheduling decisions based on the mmWave cell reports and
transmitting the decisions either via a mmWave cell or conventional microwave
cell (when control signaling paths are not available). We argue that the
proposed scheme enables efficient and highly adaptive cell selection in the
presence of the channel variability expected at mmWave frequencies.

 <dc:description>  Art Museums traditionally employ observations and surveys to enhance their
knowledge of visitors' behavior and experience. However, these approaches often
produce spatially and temporally limited empirical evidence and measurements.
Only recently has the ubiquity of digital technologies revolutionized the
ability to collect data on human behavior. Consequently, the greater
availability of large-scale datasets based on quantifying visitors' behavior
provides new opportunities to apply computational and comparative analytical
techniques. In this paper, we attempt to analyze visitors' behavior in the
Louvre Museum from anonymized longitudinal datasets collected from noninvasive
Bluetooth sensors. We examine visitors' length of stay in the museum and
consider this relationship with occupation density around artwork. This data
analysis increases the knowledge and understanding of museum professionals
related to the experience of visitors.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a MIMO networked control system with an energy
harvesting sensor, where an unstable MIMO dynamic system is connected to a
controller via a MIMO fading channel. We focus on the energy harvesting and
MIMO precoding design at the sensor so as to stabilize the unstable MIMO
dynamic plant subject to the energy availability constraint at the sensor.
Using the Lyapunov optimization approach, we propose a closed-form dynamic
energy harvesting and dynamic MIMO precoding solution, which has an
event-driven control structure. Furthermore, the MIMO precoding solution is
shown to have an eigenvalue water-filling structure, where the water level
depends on the state estimation covariance, energy queue and the channel state,
and the sea bed level depends on the state estimation covariance. The proposed
scheme is also compared with various baselines and we show that significant
performance gains can be achieved.

 <dc:description>  We present a high performance low-power digital base-band architecture,
specially designed for an energy optimized duty-cycled wake-up receiver scheme.
Based on a careful wake-up beacon design, a structured wake-up beacon detection
technique leads to an architecture that compensates for the implementation loss
of a low-power wake-up receiver front-end at low energy and area costs. Design
parameters are selected by energy optimization and the architecture is easily
scalable to support various network sizes. Fabricated in 65nm CMOS, the digital
base-band consumes 0.9uW (V_DD=0.37V) in sub-threshold operation at 250kbps,
with appropriate 97% wake-up beacon detection and 0.04% false alarm
probabilities. The circuit is fully functional at a minimum V_DD of 0.23V at
f_max=5kHz and 0.018uW power consumption. Based on these results we show that
our digital base-band can be used as a companion to compensate for front-end
implementation losses resulting from the limited wake-up receiver power budget
at a negligible cost. This implies an improvement of the practical sensitivity
of the wake-up receiver, compared to what is traditionally reported.

 <dc:description>  We have recently developed a general schedulability test framework, called
k2U, which can be applied to deal with a large variety of task models that have
been widely studied in real-time embedded systems. The k2U framework provides
several means for the users to convert arbitrary schedulability tests
(regardless of platforms and task models) into polynomial-time tests with
closed mathematical expressions. However, the applicability (as well as the
performance) of the k2U framework relies on the users to index the tasks
properly and define certain constant parameters.
  This report describes how to automatically index the tasks properly and
derive those parameters. We will cover several typical schedulability tests in
real-time systems to explain how to systematically and automatically derive
those parameters required by the k2U framework. This automation significantly
empowers the k2U framework to handle a wide range of classes of real-time
execution platforms and task models, including uniprocessor scheduling,
multiprocessor scheduling, self-suspending task systems, real-time tasks with
arrival jitter, services and virtualizations with bounded delays, etc.

 <dc:description>  Novelty detection in news events has long been a difficult problem. A number
of models performed well on specific data streams but certain issues are far
from being solved, particularly in large data streams from the WWW where
unpredictability of new terms requires adaptation in the vector space model. We
present a novel event detection system based on the Incremental Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting incorporated with
Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Our system could efficiently and effectively
adapt to the changes within the data streams of any new terms with continual
updates to the vector space model. Regarding miss probability, our proposed
novelty detection framework outperforms a recognised baseline system by
approximately 16% when evaluating a benchmark dataset from Google News.

 <dc:title>A Note on the Exact Schedulability Analysis for Segmented
  Self-Suspending Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Jian-Jia</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This report considers a sporadic real-time task system with $n$ sporadic
tasks on a uniprocessor platform, in which the lowest-priority task is a
segmented self-suspension task and the other higher-priority tasks are ordinary
sporadic real-time tasks. This report proves that the schedulability analysis
for fixed-priority preemptive scheduling even with only one segmented
self-suspending task as the lowest-priority task is $co{\cal NP}$-hard in the
strong sense. Under fixed-priority preemptive scheduling, Nelissen et al. in
ECRTS 2015 provided a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation to
calculate an upper bound on the worst-case response time of the lowest-priority
self-suspending task. This report provides a comprehensive support to explain
several hidden properties that were not provided in their paper. We also
provide an input task set to explain why the resulting solution of their MILP
formulation can be quite far from the exact worst-case response time.

 <dc:description>  Researchers have proposed various methods to extract 3D keypoints from the
surface of 3D mesh models over the last decades, but most of them are based on
geometric methods, which lack enough flexibility to meet the requirements for
various applications. In this paper, we propose a new method on the basis of
deep learning by formulating the 3D keypoint detection as a regression problem
using deep neural network (DNN) with sparse autoencoder (SAE) as our regression
model. Both local information and global information of a 3D mesh model in
multi-scale space are fully utilized to detect whether a vertex is a keypoint
or not. SAE can effectively extract the internal structure of these two kinds
of information and formulate high-level features for them, which is beneficial
to the regression model. Three SAEs are used to formulate the hidden layers of
the DNN and then a logistic regression layer is trained to process the
high-level features produced in the third SAE. Numerical experiments show that
the proposed DNN based 3D keypoint detection algorithm outperforms current five
state-of-the-art methods for various 3D mesh models.

 <dc:description>  We consider a network of sellers, each selling a single product, where the
graph structure represents pair-wise complementarities between products. We
study how the network structure affects revenue and social welfare of
equilibria of the pricing game between the sellers. We prove positive and
negative results, both of &quot;Price of Anarchy&quot; and of &quot;Price of Stability&quot; type,
for special families of graphs (paths, cycles) as well as more general ones
(trees, graphs). We describe best-reply dynamics that converge to non-trivial
equilibrium in several families of graphs, and we use these dynamics to prove
the existence of approximately-efficient equilibria.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the number of survivors in the Leader Green Election (LGE)
algorithm introduced by P. Jacquet, D. Milioris and P. Muhlethaler in 2013. Our
method is based on the Rice method and gives quite precise formulas. We derive

proper use of LGE.
  Finally, we discuss one property of a general urns and balls problem and show
a lower bound for a required number of rounds for a large class of distributed
leader election protocols.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Channel idle time distribution based secondary transmission strategies have
been studied intensively in the literature. Under various performance metrics,
the ultimate performance of secondary devices are eventually dictated by the
presumed channel idle time distribution. Such distributions can take any
arbitrary form in practice. In this work, we study idle time distributions in
wireless local area networks (WLAN) using large amount of the channel idle time
data collected in real-world WLAN networks. We demonstrate with experimental
data that the channel idle time distribution can be closely modeled by
hyper-exponential distribution. Furthermore, one can treat the primary packet
arrival process as a semi-Markov modulated Poisson process. Several secondary
transmission strategies are discussed under this model. It is shown that using
only one hyper-exponential distribution, the secondary user can achieve a
desirable performance when the primary packet arrival process is stationary.
However, experimental data suggests that in practice, this process is not
stationary and the secondary user can experience a large performance loss with
stationary transmission strategy. We propose a novel transmission strategy that
achieves suboptimal secondary user performance when the idle time distribution
is not stationary. The performances of secondary transmission strategies are
demonstrated using experimental data.

 <dc:description>  Visual recognition systems mounted on autonomous moving agents face the
challenge of unconstrained data, but simultaneously have the opportunity to
improve their performance by moving to acquire new views of test data. In this
work, we first show how a recurrent neural network-based system may be trained
to perform end-to-end learning of motion policies suited for this &quot;active
recognition&quot; setting. Further, we hypothesize that active vision requires an
agent to have the capacity to reason about the effects of its motions on its
view of the world. To verify this hypothesis, we attempt to induce this
capacity in our active recognition pipeline, by simultaneously learning to
forecast the effects of the agent's motions on its internal representation of
the environment conditional on all past views. Results across two challenging
datasets confirm both that our end-to-end system successfully learns meaningful
policies for active category recognition, and that &quot;learning to look ahead&quot;
further boosts recognition performance.

 <dc:description>  On the one hand we state {\it Nash equilibrium} (NE) as a formal theorem on
multilinear forms and give a pedagogically simple proof, free of game theory
terminology. On the other hand, inspired by this formalism, we prove a {\it
multilinear minimax theorem}, a generalization of von Neumann's bilinear
minimax theorem. Next, we relate the two theorems by proving that the solution
of a multilinear minimax problem, computable via linear programming, serves as
an approximation to Nash equilibrium point, where its multilinear value
provides an upper bound on a convex combination of {\it expected payoffs}.
Furthermore, each positive probability vector once assigned to the set of
players induces a {\it diagonally-scaled} multilinear minimax optimization with
a corresponding approximation to NE. In summary, in this note we exhibit an
infinity of multilinear minimax optimization problems each of which provides a
polynomial-time computable approximation to Nash equilibrium point, known to be
difficult to compute. The theoretical and practical qualities of these
approximations are the subject of further investigations.

 <dc:description>  This work addresses the challenge of a robot using real-time feedback from
contact sensors to reliably manipulate a movable object on a cluttered
tabletop. We formulate contact manipulation as a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) in the joint space of robot configurations and object
poses. The POMDP formulation enables the robot to actively gather information
and reduce the uncertainty on the object pose. Further, it incorporates all
major constraints for robot manipulation: kinematic reachability,
self-collision, and collision with obstacles. To solve the POMDP, we apply
DESPOT, a state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithm. Our approach leverages two
key ideas for computational efficiency. First, it performs lazy construction of
a configuration-space lattice by interleaving construction of the lattice and
online POMDP planning. Second, it combines online and offline POMDP planning by
solving relaxed POMDP offline and using the solution to guide the online search
algorithm. We evaluated the proposed approach on a seven degree-of-freedom
robot arm in simulation environments. It significantly outperforms several
existing algorithms, including some commonly used heuristics for contact
manipulation under uncertainty.

 <dc:description>  Sparse representation has been widely studied in visual tracking, which has
shown promising tracking performance. Despite a lot of progress, the visual
tracking problem is still a challenging task due to appearance variations over
time. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse tracking algorithm that well
addresses temporal appearance changes, by enforcing template representability
and temporal consistency (TRAC). By modeling temporal consistency, our
algorithm addresses the issue of drifting away from a tracking target. By
exploring the templates' long-term-short-term representability, the proposed
method adaptively updates the dictionary using the most descriptive templates,
which significantly improves the robustness to target appearance changes. We
compare our TRAC algorithm against the state-of-the-art approaches on 12
challenging benchmark image sequences. Both qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art trackers.

 <dc:title>Stochastic Contextual Bandits with Known Reward Functions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sakulkar, Pranav</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many sequential decision-making problems in communication networks can be
modeled as contextual bandit problems, which are natural extensions of the
well-known multi-armed bandit problem. In contextual bandit problems, at each
time, an agent observes some side information or context, pulls one arm and
receives the reward for that arm. We consider a stochastic formulation where
the context-reward tuples are independently drawn from an unknown distribution
in each trial. Motivated by networking applications, we analyze a setting where
the reward is a known non-linear function of the context and the chosen arm's
current state. We first consider the case of discrete and finite context-spaces
and propose DCB($\epsilon$), an algorithm that we prove, through a careful
analysis, yields regret (cumulative reward gap compared to a distribution-aware
genie) scaling logarithmically in time and linearly in the number of arms that
are not optimal for any context, improving over existing algorithms where the
regret scales linearly in the total number of arms. We then study continuous
context-spaces with Lipschitz reward functions and propose CCB($\epsilon,
\delta$), an algorithm that uses DCB($\epsilon$) as a subroutine.
CCB($\epsilon, \delta$) reveals a novel regret-storage trade-off that is
parametrized by $\delta$. Tuning $\delta$ to the time horizon allows us to
obtain sub-linear regret bounds, while requiring sub-linear storage. By
exploiting joint learning for all contexts we get regret bounds for
CCB($\epsilon, \delta$) that are unachievable by any existing contextual bandit
algorithm for continuous context-spaces. We also show similar performance
bounds for the unknown horizon case.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  General purpose Search Engines (SEs) crawl all domains (e.g., Sports, News,
Entertainment) of the Web, but sometimes the informational need of a query is
restricted to a particular domain (e.g., Medical). We leverage the work of SEs
as part of our effort to route domain specific queries to local Digital
Libraries (DLs). SEs are often used even if they are not the &quot;best&quot; source for
certain types of queries. Rather than tell users to &quot;use this DL for this kind
of query&quot;, we intend to automatically detect when a query could be better
served by a local DL (such as a private, access-controlled DL that is not
crawlable via SEs). This is not an easy task because Web queries are short,
ambiguous, and there is lack of quality labeled training data (or it is
expensive to create). To detect queries that should be routed to local,
specialized DLs, we first send the queries to Google and then examine the
features in the resulting Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs), and then classify
the query as belonging to either the scholar or non-scholar domain. Using
400,000 AOL queries for the non-scholar domain and 400,000 queries from the
NASA Technical Report Server (NTRS) for the scholar domain, our classifier
achieved a precision of 0.809 and F-measure of 0.805.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a general class of distances (metrics) between Markov chains,
which are based on linear behaviour. This class encompasses distances given
topologically (such as the total variation distance or trace distance) as well
as by temporal logics or automata. We investigate which of the distances can be
approximated by observing the systems, i.e. by black-box testing or simulation,
and we provide both negative and positive results.

 <dc:description>  A new technique for approximating the entire solution set for a nonlinear
system of relations (nonlinear equations, inequalities, etc. involving
algebraic, smooth, or even continuous functions) is presented. The technique is
to first plot each function as a pixel matrix, and to then perform a sequence
of basic matrix operations, as dictated by how variables are shared by the
relations in the system. The result is a pixel matrix graphing the approximated
simultaneous solution set for the system.

 <dc:description>  Distributed detection fusion with high-dimension conditionally dependent
observations is known to be a challenging problem. When a fusion rule is fixed,
this paper attempts to make progress on this problem for the large sensor
networks by proposing a new Monte Carlo framework. Through the Monte Carlo
importance sampling, we derive a necessary condition for optimal sensor
decision rules in the sense of minimizing the approximated Bayesian cost
function. Then, a Gauss-Seidel/person-by-person optimization algorithm can be
obtained to search the optimal sensor decision rules. It is proved that the
discretized algorithm is finitely convergent. The complexity of the new
algorithm is $O(LN)$ compared with $O(LN^L)$ of the previous algorithm where
$L$ is the number of sensors and $N$ is a constant. Thus, the proposed methods
allows us to design the large sensor networks with general high-dimension
dependent observations. Furthermore, an interesting result is that, for the
fixed AND or OR fusion rules, we can analytically derive the optimal solution
in the sense of minimizing the approximated Bayesian cost function. In general,
the solution of the Gauss-Seidel algorithm is only local optimal. However, in
the new framework, we can prove that the solution of Gauss-Seidel algorithm is
same as the analytically optimal solution in the case of the AND or OR fusion
rule. The typical examples with dependent observations and large number of
sensors are examined under this new framework. The results of numerical
examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithm.

 <dc:description>  The susceptible--infected--susceptible (SIS) epidemic process on complex
networks can show metastability, resembling an endemic equilibrium. In a
general setting, the metastable state may involve a large portion of the
network, or it can be localized on small subgraphs of the contact network.
Localized infections are not interesting because a true outbreak concerns
network--wide invasion of the contact graph rather than localized infection of
certain sites within the contact network. Existing approaches to localization
phenomenon suffer from a major drawback: they fully rely on the steady--state
solution of mean--field approximate models in the neighborhood of their phase
transition point, where their approximation accuracy is worst; as statistical
physics tells us. We propose a dispersion entropy measure that quantifies the
localization of infections in a generic contact graph. Formulating a maximum
entropy problem, we find an upper bound for the dispersion entropy of the
possible metastable state in the exact SIS process. As a result, we find
sufficient conditions such that any initial infection over the network either
dies out or reaches a localized metastable state. Unlike existing studies
relying on the solution of mean--field approximate models, our investigation of
epidemic localization is based on characteristics of exact SIS equations. Our
proposed method offers a new paradigm in studying spreading processes over
complex networks.

 <dc:title>Fundamental Tradeoff between Storage and Latency in Cache-Aided Wireless
  Interference Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies the fundamental tradeoff between storage and latency in a
general wireless interference network with caches equipped at all transmitters
and receivers. The tradeoff is characterized by an information-theoretic
metric, \emph{normalized delivery time} (NDT), which is the worst-case delivery
time of the actual traffic load at a transmission rate specified by degrees of
freedom (DoF) of a given channel. We obtain both an achievable upper bound and
a theoretical lower bound of the minimum NDT for any number of transmitters,
any number of receivers, and any feasible cache size tuple. We show that the
achievable NDT is exactly optimal in certain cache size regions, and is within
a bounded multiplicative gap to the theoretical lower bound in other regions.
In the achievability analysis, we first propose a novel cooperative
transmitter/receiver coded caching strategy. It offers the freedom to adjust
file splitting ratios for NDT minimization. We then propose a delivery strategy
which transforms the considered interference network into a new class of
cooperative X-multicast channels. It leverages local caching gain, coded
multicasting gain, and transmitter cooperation gain (via interference alignment
and interference neutralization) opportunistically. Finally, the achievable NDT
is obtained by solving a linear programming problem. This study reveals that
with caching at both transmitter and receiver sides, the network can benefit
simultaneously from traffic load reduction and transmission rate enhancement,
thereby effectively reducing the content delivery latency.

 <dc:description>  This work focuses on the minimum transmission energy required for
communicating a pair of correlated Gaussian sources over a two-user Gaussian
broadcast channel with noiseless and causal channel output feedback (GBCF). We
study the fundamental limit on the required transmission energy for
broadcasting a pair of source samples, such that each source can be
reconstructed at its respective receiver to within a target distortion, when
the source-channel bandwidth ratio is not restricted. We derive a lower bound
and three distinct upper bounds on the minimum required energy. For the upper
bounds we analyze three transmission schemes: Two schemes are based on separate
source-channel coding, and apply coding over multiple samples of source pairs.
The third scheme is based on joint source-channel coding obtained by extending
the Ozarow-Leung (OL) transmission scheme, which applies uncoded linear
transmission. Numerical simulations show that despite its simplicity, the
energy-distortion tradeoff of the OL-based scheme is close to that of the
better separation-based scheme, which indicates that the OL scheme is
attractive for energy-efficient source transmission over GBCFs.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sharing the spectrum among multiple operators seems promising in millimeter
wave (mmWave) systems. One explanation is the highly directional transmission
in mmWave, which reduces the interference caused by one network on the other
networks sharing the same resources. In this paper, we model a mmWave cellular
system where an operator that primarily owns an exclusive-use license of a
certain band can sell a restricted secondary license of the same band to
another operator. This secondary network has a restriction on the maximum
interference it can cause to the original network. Using stochastic geometry,
we derive expressions for the coverage and rate of both networks, and establish
the feasibility of secondary licensing in licensed mmWave bands. To explain
economic trade-offs, we consider a revenue-pricing model for both operators in
the presence of a central licensing authority. Our results show that the
original operator and central network authority can benefit from secondary
licensing when the maximum interference threshold is properly adjusted. This
means that the original operator and central licensing authority have an
incentive to permit a secondary network to restrictively share the spectrum.
Our results also illustrate that the spectrum sharing gains increase with
narrow beams and when the network densifies.

 <dc:title>On Optimal Offline Time Sharing Policy for Energy Harvesting Underlay
  Cognitive Radio</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  RF energy harvesting can be used to power communication devices so that
perpetual operation of such devices can be ensured. We consider a RF energy
harvesting underlay cognitive radio system operating in slotted fashion. The
primary user (PU) is equipped with a reliable power source and transmits with a
constant power in all the slots. However, the secondary user (SU) harvests
energy from primary's transmission and simultaneously transmits it's own data
such that interference at the primary receiver (PR) remains below an acceptable
threshold. At the secondary transmitter (ST), each time slot is divided into
two phases: energy harvesting (EH) phase and information transfer (IT) phase.
We formulated the problem of maximizing the achievable secondary sum rate under
primary receiver's protection criteria as a convex optimization problem and
obtained the optimal time sharing between EH and IT phase, and optimal
secondary transmit power under offline setting. The optimal offline scheme is
then compared with an online myopic policy, where the optimal time sharing
between EH and IT phase, and optimal secondary transmit power are obtained
based on instantaneous channel gains only.

 <dc:description>  Large-scale automated meta-analysis of neuroimaging data has recently
established itself as an important tool in advancing our understanding of human
brain function. This research has been pioneered by NeuroSynth, a database
collecting both brain activation coordinates and associated text across a large
cohort of neuroimaging research papers. One of the fundamental aspects of such
meta-analysis is text-mining. To date, word counts and more sophisticated
methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation have been proposed. In this work we
present an unsupervised study of the NeuroSynth text corpus using Deep
Boltzmann Machines (DBMs). The use of DBMs yields several advantages over the
aforementioned methods, principal among which is the fact that it yields both
word and document embeddings in a high-dimensional vector space. Such
embeddings serve to facilitate the use of traditional machine learning
techniques on the text corpus. The proposed DBM model is shown to learn
embeddings with a clear semantic structure.

 <dc:title>Common-Description Learning: A Framework for Learning Algorithms and

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Current learning algorithms face many difficulties in learning simple
patterns and using them to learn more complex ones. They also require more
examples than humans do to learn the same pattern, assuming no prior knowledge.
In this paper, a new learning framework is introduced that is called
common-description learning (CDL). This framework has been tested on 32 small
multi-task datasets, and the results show that it was able to learn complex
algorithms from a few number of examples. The final model is perfectly
interpretable and its depth depends on the question. What is meant by depth
here is that whenever needed, the model learns to break down the problem into
simpler subproblems and solves them using previously learned models. Finally,
we explain the capabilities of our framework in discovering complex relations
in data and how it can help in improving language understanding in machines.

 <dc:title>Fast Rates for General Unbounded Loss Functions: from ERM to Generalized

 <dc:description>  We present new excess risk bounds for general unbounded loss functions
including log loss and squared loss, where the distribution of the losses may
be heavy-tailed. The bounds hold for general estimators, but they are optimized
when applied to $\eta$-generalized Bayesian, MDL, and ERM estimators. When
applied with log loss, the bounds imply convergence rates for generalized
Bayesian inference under misspecification in terms of a generalization of the
Hellinger metric as long as the learning rate $\eta$ is set correctly. For
general loss functions, our bounds rely on two separate conditions: the
$v$-GRIP (generalized reversed information projection) conditions, which
control the lower tail of the excess loss; and the newly introduced witness
condition, which controls the upper tail. The parameter $v$ in the $v$-GRIP
conditions determines the achievable rate and is akin to the exponent in the
well-known Tsybakov margin condition and the Bernstein condition for bounded
losses, which the $v$-GRIP conditions generalize; favorable $v$ in combination
with small model complexity leads to $\tilde{O}(1/n)$ rates. The witness
condition allows us to connect the excess risk to an 'annealed' version
thereof, by which we generalize several previous results connecting Hellinger

 <dc:description>  Uncertain wiretap channels are introduced. Their zero-error secrecy capacity
is defined. If the sensor-estimator channel is perfect, it is also calculated.
Further properties are discussed. The problem of estimating a dynamical system
with nonstochastic disturbances is studied where the sensor is connected to the
estimator and an eavesdropper via an uncertain wiretap channel. The estimator
should obtain a uniformly bounded estimation error whereas the eavesdropper's
error should tend to infinity. It is proved that the system can be estimated
securely if the zero-error capacity of the sensor-estimator channel is strictly
larger than the logarithm of the system's unstable pole and the zero-error
secrecy capacity of the uncertain wiretap channel is positive.

 <dc:description>  Particle smoothing methods are used for inference of stochastic processes
based on noisy observations. Typically, the estimation of the marginal
posterior distribution given all observations is cumbersome and computational
intensive. In this paper, we propose a simple algorithm based on path integral
control theory to estimate the smoothing distribution of continuous-time
diffusion processes with partial observations. In particular, we use an
adaptive importance sampling method to improve the effective sampling size of
the posterior over processes given the observations and the reliability of the
estimation of the marginals. This is achieved by estimating a feedback
controller to sample efficiently from the joint smoothing distributions. We
compare the results with estimations obtained from the standard Forward
Filter/Backward Simulator for two diffusion processes of different complexity.
We show that the proposed method gives more reliable estimations than the
standard FFBSi when the smoothing distribution is poorly represented by the
filter distribution.

 <dc:description>  We present PrivInfer, an expressive framework for writing and verifying
differentially private Bayesian machine learning algorithms. Programs in
PrivInfer are written in a rich functional probabilistic programming language
with constructs for performing Bayesian inference. Then, differential privacy
of programs is established using a relational refinement type system, in which
refinements on probability types are indexed by a metric on distributions. Our
framework leverages recent developments in Bayesian inference, probabilistic
programming languages, and in relational refinement types. We demonstrate the
expressiveness of PrivInfer by verifying privacy for several examples of
private Bayesian inference.

 <dc:description>  One of the main methods for interacting with mobile devices today is the
error-prone and inflexible touch-screen keyboard. This paper proposes MagBoard:
a homomorphic ubiquitous keyboard for mobile devices. MagBoard allows
application developers and users to design and print different custom keyboards
for the same applications to fit different user's needs. The core idea is to
leverage the triaxial magnetometer embedded in standard mobile phones to
accurately localize the location of a magnet on a virtual grid superimposed on
the printed keyboard. This is achieved through a once in a lifetime
fingerprint. MagBoard also provides a number of modules that allow it to cope
with background magnetic noise, heterogeneous devices, different magnet shapes,
sizes, and strengths, as well as changes in magnet polarity. Our implementation
of MagBoard on Android phones with extensive evaluation in different scenarios
demonstrates that it can achieve a key detection accuracy of more than 91% for
keys as small as 2cm*2cm, reaching 100% for 4cm*4cm keys. This accuracy is
robust with different phones and magnets, highlighting MagBoard promise as a
homomorphic ubiquitous keyboard for mobile devices.

 <dc:description>  Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is a classic technique that seeks vectorial
representations for data points, given the pairwise distances between them.
However, in recent years, data are usually collected from diverse sources or
have multiple heterogeneous representations. How to do multidimensional scaling
on multiple input distance matrices is still unsolved to our best knowledge. In
this paper, we first define this new task formally. Then, we propose a new
algorithm called Multi-View Multidimensional Scaling (MVMDS) by considering
each input distance matrix as one view. Our algorithm is able to learn the
weights of views (i.e., distance matrices) automatically by exploring the
consensus information and complementary nature of views. Experimental results
on synthetic as well as real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MVMDS.
We hope that our work encourages a wider consideration in many domains where
MDS is needed.

 <dc:description>  Secure multi-party computation (SMC) techniques are increasingly becoming
more efficient and practical thanks to many recent novel improvements. The
recent work have shown that different protocols that are implemented using
different sharing mechanisms (e.g., boolean, arithmetic sharings, etc.) may
have different computational and communication costs. Although there are some
works that automatically mix protocols of different sharing schemes to fasten
execution, none of them provide a generic optimization framework to find the
cheapest mixed-protocol SMC execution for cloud deployment.
  In this work, we propose a generic SMC optimization framework CheapSMC that
can use any mixed-protocol SMC circuit evaluation tool as a black-box to find
the cheapest SMC cloud deployment option. To find the cheapest SMC protocol,
CheapSMC runs one time benchmarks for the target cloud service and gathers
performance statistics for basic circuit components. Using these performance
statistics, optimization layer of CheapSMC runs multiple heuristics to find the
cheapest mix-protocol circuit evaluation. Later on, the optimized circuit is
passed to a mix-protocol SMC tool for actual executable generation. Our
empirical results gathered by running different cases studies show that
significant cost savings could be achieved using our optimization framework.

 <dc:description>  Personalization is the process of fitting a model to patient data, a critical
step towards application of multi-physics computational models in clinical
practice. Designing robust personalization algorithms is often a tedious,
time-consuming, model- and data-specific process. We propose to use artificial
intelligence concepts to learn this task, inspired by how human experts
manually perform it. The problem is reformulated in terms of reinforcement
learning. In an off-line phase, Vito, our self-taught artificial agent, learns
a representative decision process model through exploration of the
computational model: it learns how the model behaves under change of
parameters. The agent then automatically learns an optimal strategy for on-line
personalization. The algorithm is model-independent; applying it to a new model
requires only adjusting few hyper-parameters of the agent and defining the
observations to match. The full knowledge of the model itself is not required.
Vito was tested in a synthetic scenario, showing that it could learn how to
optimize cost functions generically. Then Vito was applied to the inverse
problem of cardiac electrophysiology and the personalization of a whole-body
circulation model. The obtained results suggested that Vito could achieve
equivalent, if not better goodness of fit than standard methods, while being
more robust (up to 11% higher success rates) and with faster (up to seven
times) convergence rate. Our artificial intelligence approach could thus make
personalization algorithms generalizable and self-adaptable to any patient and
any model.

 <dc:description>  Multimedia conferencing is the real-time exchange of multimedia content
between multiple parties. It is the basis of a wide range of applications
(e.g., multimedia multiplayer game). Cloud-based provisioning of the
conferencing services on which these applications rely will bring benefits,
such as easy service provisioning and elastic scalability. However, it remains
a big challenge. This paper proposes a PaaS for conferencing service
provisioning. The proposed PaaS is based on a business model from the state of
the art. It relies on conferencing IaaSs that, instead of VMs, offer
conferencing substrates (e.g., dial-in signaling, video mixer and audio mixer).
The PaaS enables composition of new conferences from substrates on the fly.
This has been prototyped in this paper and, in order to evaluate it, a
conferencing IaaS is also implemented. Performance measurements are also made.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a two-sided matching problem with a defined notion of pairwise
stability. We propose a distributed blind matching algorithm (BLMA) to solve
the problem. We prove the solution produced by BLMA will converge to an
$\epsilon$-pairwise stable outcome with probability one. We then consider a
matching problem in cognitive radio networks. Secondary users (SUs) are allowed
access time to the spectrum belonging to the primary users (PUs) provided that
they relay primary messages. We propose a realization of the BLMA to produce an
$\epsilon$-pairwise stable solution assuming quasi-convex and quasi-concave
utilities. In the case of more general utility forms, we show another BLMA
realization to provide a stable solution. Furthermore, we propose negotiation
mechanism to bias the algorithm towards one side of the market. We use this
mechanism to protect the exclusive rights of the PUs to the spectrum. In all
such implementations of the BLMA, we impose a limited information exchange in
the network so that agents can only calculate their own utilities, but no
information is available about the utilities of any other users in the network.

 <dc:description>  Apples, porcupines, and the most obscure Bob Dylan song---is every topic a
few clicks from Philosophy? Within Wikipedia, the surprising answer is yes:
nearly all paths lead to Philosophy. Wikipedia is the largest, most
meticulously indexed collection of human knowledge ever amassed. More than
information about a topic, Wikipedia is a web of naturally emerging
relationships. By following the first link in each article, we algorithmically
construct a directed network of all 4.7 million articles: Wikipedia's First
Link Network. Here, we study the English edition of Wikipedia's First Link
Network for insight into how the many articles on inventions, places, people,
objects, and events are related and organized.
  By traversing every path, we measure the accumulation of first links, path
lengths, groups of path-connected articles, and cycles. We also develop a new
method, traversal funnels, to measure the influence each article exerts in
shaping the network. Traversal funnels provides a new measure of influence for
directed networks without spill-over into cycles, in contrast to traditional
network centrality measures. Within Wikipedia's First Link Network, we find
scale-free distributions describe path length, accumulation, and influence. Far
from dispersed, first links disproportionately accumulate at a few
articles---flowing from specific to general and culminating around fundamental
notions such as Community, State, and Science. Philosophy directs more paths
than any other article by two orders of magnitude. We also observe a
gravitation towards topical articles such as Health Care and Fossil Fuel. These
findings enrich our view of the connections and structure of Wikipedia's ever
growing store of knowledge.

 <dc:description>  Computational complexity and approximation algorithms are reported for a
problem of stabbing a set of straight line segments with the least cardinality
set of disks of fixed radii $r&gt;0$ where the set of segments forms a straight
line drawing $G=(V,E)$ of a planar graph without edge crossings. Close
geometric problems arise in network security applications. We give strong
NP-hardness of the problem for edge sets of Delaunay triangulations, Gabriel
graphs and other subgraphs (which are often used in network design) for $r\in
[d_{\min},\eta d_{\max}]$ and some constant $\eta$ where $d_{\max}$ and
$d_{\min}$ are Euclidean lengths of the longest and shortest graph edges
respectively. Fast $O(|E|\log|E|)$-time $O(1)$-approximation algorithm is
proposed within the class of straight line drawings of planar graphs for which
the inequality $r\geq \eta d_{\max}$ holds uniformly for some constant
$\eta&gt;0,$ i.e. when lengths of edges of $G$ are uniformly bounded from above by
some linear function of $r.$

 <dc:description>  Due to process variation in nanoscale manufacturing, there may be permanently
missing connections in information processing hardware. Due to timing errors in
circuits, there may be missed messages in intra-chip communications, equivalent
to transiently missing connections. In this work, we investigate the
performance of message-passing LDPC decoders in the presence of missing
connections. We prove concentration and convergence theorems that validate the
use of density evolution performance analysis. Arbitrarily small error
probability is not possible with missing connections, but we find suitably
defined decoding thresholds for communication systems with binary erasure
channels under peeling decoding, as well as binary symmetric channels under
Gallager A and B decoding. We see that decoding is robust to missing wires, as
decoding thresholds degrade smoothly. Moreover, there is a stochastic
facilitation effect in Gallager B decoders with missing connections. We also
compare the decoding sensitivity with respect to channel noise and missing
wiring.

 <dc:description>  A two-tier heterogeneous cellular network (HCN) with intra-tier and
inter-tier dependence is studied. The macro cell deployment follows a Poisson
point process (PPP) and two different clustered point processes are used to
model the cache-enabled small cells. Under this model, we derive approximate
expressions in terms of finite integrals for the average delivery rate
considering inter-tier and intra-tier dependence. On top of the fact that cache
size drastically improves the performance of small cells in terms of average
delivery rate, we show that rate splitting of limited-backhaul induces
non-linear performance variations, and therefore has to be adjusted for rate
fairness among users of different tiers.

 <dc:description>  We study the adaptive modulation (AM) problem in a network-coded two-way
relay channel (NC-TWRC), where each of the two users controls its own bit rate
in the $m$-ary quadrature amplitude modulation ($m$-QAM) to minimize the
transmission error rate and enhance the spectral efficiency. We show that there
exists a strategic complementarity, one user tends to transmit while the other
decides to do so in order to enhance the overall spectral efficiency, which is
beyond the scope of the conventional single-agent AM scheduling method. We
propose a two-player game model parameterized by the signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs) of two user-to-user channels and prove that it is a supermodular game
where there always exist the extremal pure strategy Nash equilibria (PSNEs),
the largest and smallest PSNEs. We show by simulation results that the extremal
PSNEs incur a similar bit error rate (BER) as the conventional single-agent AM
scheme, but significantly improve the spectral efficiency in the NC-TWRC
system. The study also reveals the Pareto order of the extremal PSNEs: The
largest and smallest PSNEs are Pareto worst and best PSNEs, respectively.
Finally, we derive the sufficient conditions for the extremal PSNEs to be
symmetric and monotonic in channel SNRs. We also discuss how to utilize the
symmetry and monotonicity to relieve the complexity in the PSNE learning
process.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a framework for recognizing human activities that
uses only in-topic dominant codewords and a mixture of intertopic vectors.
Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is used to develop approximations of human
motion primitives; these are mid-level representations, and they adaptively
integrate dominant vectors when classifying human activities. In LDA topic
modeling, action videos (documents) are represented by a bag-of-words (input
from a dictionary), and these are based on improved dense trajectories. The
output topics correspond to human motion primitives, such as finger moving or
subtle leg motion. We eliminate the impurities, such as missed tracking or
changing light conditions, in each motion primitive. The assembled vector of
motion primitives is an improved representation of the action. We demonstrate
our method on four different datasets.

 <dc:title>Some Insights into the Geometry and Training of Neural Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Berg, Ewout van den</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Neural networks have been successfully used for classification tasks in a
rapidly growing number of practical applications. Despite their popularity and
widespread use, there are still many aspects of training and classification
that are not well understood. In this paper we aim to provide some new insights
into training and classification by analyzing neural networks from a
feature-space perspective. We review and explain the formation of decision
regions and study some of their combinatorial aspects. We place a particular
emphasis on the connections between the neural network weight and bias terms
and properties of decision boundaries and other regions that exhibit varying
levels of classification confidence. We show how the error backpropagates in
these regions and emphasize the important role they have in the formation of
gradients. These findings expose the connections between scaling of the weight
parameters and the density of the training samples. This sheds more light on
the vanishing gradient problem, explains the need for regularization, and
suggests an approach for subsampling training data to improve performance.

 <dc:description>  Most of the existing robotic exploration schemes use occupancy grid
representations and geometric targets known as frontiers. The occupancy grid
representation relies on the assumption of independence between grid cells and
ignores structural correlations present in the environment. We develop a
Gaussian Processes (GPs) occupancy mapping technique that is computationally
tractable for online map building due to its incremental formulation and
provides a continuous model of uncertainty over the map spatial coordinates.
The standard way to represent geometric frontiers extracted from occupancy maps
is to assign binary values to each grid cell. We extend this notion to novel
probabilistic frontier maps computed efficiently using the gradient of the GP
occupancy map. We also propose a mutual information-based greedy exploration
technique built on that representation that takes into account all possible
future observations. A major advantage of high-dimensional map inference is the
fact that such techniques require fewer observations, leading to a faster map
entropy reduction during exploration for map building scenarios. Evaluations
using the publicly available datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework for robotic mapping and exploration tasks.

 <dc:description>  The problem of estimating parameters of linear control valve with hysteresis
is considered. The hysteretic behavior of control valve is formulated as a
switched linear model. An indicator vector, which shows the switching epochs of
switched linear model, is explored by subspace decomposition on measurements.
With the help of indicator vector, the noisy measurements are classified into
separate groups, each corresponding to up-stroke and down-stroke of control
valve respectively. The least squares technique is adopted to estimate the
parameters of control valve. It is shown that the proposed technique exactly
estimates the parameters and switching epochs in absence of noise and exhibits
dominant advantage in noisy case.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a self-contained, soft robotic hand composed of soft pneumatic
actuator modules that are equipped with strain and pressure sensing. We show
how this data can be used to discern whether a grasp was successful.
Co-locating sensing and embedded computation with the actuators greatly
simplifies control and system integration. Equipped with a small pump, the hand
is self-contained and needs only power and data supplied by a single USB
connection to a PC. We demonstrate its function by grasping a variety of
objects ranging from very small to large and heavy objects weighing more than
the hand itself. The presented system nicely illustrates the advantages of soft
robotics: low cost, low weight, and intrinsic compliance. We exploit
morphological computation to simplify control, which allows successful grasping
via underactuation. Grasping indeed relies on morphological computation at
multiple levels, ranging from the geometry of the actuator which determines the
actuator's kinematics, embedded strain sensors to measure curvature, to
maximizing contact area and applied force during grasping. Morphological
computation reaches its limitations, however, when objects are too bulky to
self-align with the gripper or when the state of grasping is of interest. We
therefore argue that efficient and reliable grasping also requires not only
intrinsic compliance, but also embedded sensing and computation. In particular,
we show how embedded sensing can be used to detect successful grasps and vary
the force exerted onto an object based on local feedback, which is not possible
using morphological computation alone.

 <dc:description>  CPU scheduling is one of the most crucial operations performed by operating
system. Different algorithms are available for CPU scheduling amongst them RR
(Round Robin) is considered as optimal in time shared environment. The
effectiveness of Round Robin completely depends on the choice of time quantum.
In this paper a new CPU scheduling algorithm has been proposed, named as DABRR
(Dynamic Average Burst Round Robin). That uses dynamic time quantum instead of
static time quantum used in RR. The performance of the proposed algorithm is
experimentally compared with traditional RR and some existing variants of RR.
The results of our approach presented in this paper demonstrate improved
performance in terms of average waiting time, average turnaround time, and
context switching.

 <dc:description>  This paper shows that it is possible to train large and deep convolutional
neural networks (CNN) for JPEG compression artifacts reduction, and that such
networks can provide significantly better reconstruction quality compared to
previously used smaller networks as well as to any other state-of-the-art
methods. We were able to train networks with 8 layers in a single step and in
relatively short time by combining residual learning, skip architecture, and
symmetric weight initialization. We provide further insights into convolution
networks for JPEG artifact reduction by evaluating three different objectives,
generalization with respect to training dataset size, and generalization with
respect to JPEG quality level.

 <dc:description>  A non-deterministic recursion scheme recognizes a language of finite trees.
This very expressive model can simulate, among others, higher-order pushdown
automata with collapse. We show decidability of the diagonal problem for
schemes. This result has several interesting consequences. In particular, it
gives an algorithm that computes the downward closure of languages of words
recognized by schemes. In turn, this has immediate application to separability
problems and reachability analysis of concurrent systems.

 <dc:title>A Linear-Time Algorithm for the Weighted Paired-Domination Problem on

 <dc:description>  In a graph $G = (V,E)$, a vertex subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ is said to be a
dominating set of $G$ if every vertex not in $S$ is adjacent to a vertex in
$S$. A dominating set $S$ of $G$ is called a paired-dominating set of $G$ if
the induced subgraph $G[S]$ contains a perfect matching. In this paper, we
propose an $O(n+m)$-time algorithm for the weighted paired-domination problem
on block graphs using dynamic programming, which strengthens the results in
[Theoret. Comput. Sci., 410(47--49):5063--5071, 2009] and [J. Comb. Optim.,
19(4):457--470, 2010]. Moreover, the algorithm can be completed in $O(n)$ time
if the block-cut-vertex structure of $G$ is given.

 <dc:description>  Healthiness is a good old question in program logics that dates back to
Dijkstra. It asks for an intrinsic characterization of those predicate
transformers which arise as the (backward) interpretation of a certain class of
programs. There are several results known for healthiness conditions: for
deterministic programs, nondeterministic ones, probabilistic ones, etc.
Building upon our previous works on so-called state-and-effect triangles, we
contribute a unified categorical framework for investigating healthiness
conditions. We find the framework to be centered around a dual adjunction
induced by a dualizing object, together with our notion of relative
Eilenberg-Moore algebra playing fundamental roles too. The latter notion seems
interesting in its own right in the context of monads, Lawvere theories and
enriched categories.

 <dc:description>  While spectrum at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies is less scarce than at
traditional frequencies below 6 GHz, still it is not unlimited, in particular
if we consider the requirements from other services using the same band and the
need to license mmWave bands to multiple mobile operators. Therefore, an
efficient spectrum access scheme is critical to harvest the maximum benefit
from emerging mmWave technologies. In this paper, motivated by previous results
where spectrum pooling was proved to be more feasible at high mmWave
frequencies, we study the performance of a hybrid spectrum scheme where
exclusive access is used at frequencies in the 20/30 GHz range while spectrum
pooling/unlicensed spectrum is used at frequencies around 70 GHz. Our
preliminary results show that hybrid spectrum access is a promising approach
for mmWave networks, and motivate further studies to achieve a more complete
understanding of both technical and non technical implications.

 <dc:description>  A non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) approach to user signal power
allocation called Fair-NOMA is introduced. Fair-NOMA is the application of NOMA
in such a way that two mobile users have the opportunity to always achieve at
least the information capacity they can achieve by using orthogonal multiple
access (OMA), regardless of the user selection criteria, making it suitable for
implementation using any current or future scheduling paradigms. Given this
condition, the bounds of the power allocation coefficients are derived as
functions of the channel gains of the two mobile users. The NOMA power
allocation is analyzed for two scheduled users that are selected randomly with
i.i.d. channel gains. The capacity improvements made by each user and the sum
capacity improvement are derived.

 <dc:description>  Causal inference concerns the identification of cause-effect relationships
between variables. However, often only linear combinations of variables
constitute meaningful causal variables. For example, recovering the signal of a
cortical source from electroencephalography requires a well-tuned combination
of signals recorded at multiple electrodes. We recently introduced the MERLiN
(Mixture Effect Recovery in Linear Networks) algorithm that is able to recover,
from an observed linear mixture, a causal variable that is a linear effect of
another given variable. Here we relax the assumption of this cause-effect
relationship being linear and present an extended algorithm that can pick up
non-linear cause-effect relationships. Thus, the main contribution is an
algorithm (and ready to use code) that has broader applicability and allows for
a richer model class. Furthermore, a comparative analysis indicates that the
assumption of linear cause-effect relationships is not restrictive in analysing
electroencephalographic data.

 <dc:title>Revisiting Human Action Recognition: Personalization vs. Generalization</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  By thoroughly revisiting the classic human action recognition paradigm, this
paper aims at proposing a new approach for the design of effective action
classification systems. Taking as testbed publicly available three-dimensional
(MoCap) action/activity datasets, we analyzed and validated different
training/testing strategies. In particular, considering that each human action
in the datasets is performed several times by different subjects, we were able
to precisely quantify the effect of inter- and intra-subject variability, so as
to figure out the impact of several learning approaches in terms of
classification performance. The net result is that standard testing strategies
consisting in cross-validating the algorithm using typical splits of the data
(holdout, k-fold, or one-subject-out) is always outperformed by a
&quot;personalization&quot; strategy which learns how a subject is performing an action.
In other words, it is advantageous to customize (i.e., personalize) the method
to learn the actions carried out by each subject, rather than trying to
generalize the actions executions across subjects. Consequently, we finally
propose an action recognition framework consisting of a two-stage
classification approach where, given a test action, the subject is first
identified before the actual recognition of the action takes place. Despite the
basic, off-the-shelf descriptors and standard classifiers adopted, we noted a
relevant increase in performance with respect to standard state-of-the-art
algorithms, so motivating the usage of personalized approaches for designing
effective action recognition systems.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Address Allocation Algorithm for Mobile Ad hoc Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A Mobile Ad hoc network (MANET) consists of nodes which use multi-hop
communication to establish connection between nodes. Traditional infrastructure
based systems use a centralized architecture for address allocation. However,
this is not possible in Ad hoc networks due to their dynamic structure. Many
schemes have been proposed to solve this problem, but most of them use
network-wide broadcasts to ensure the availability of a new address. This
becomes extremely difficult as network size grows. In this paper, we propose an
address allocation algorithm which avoids network-wide broadcasts to allocate
address to a new node. Moreover, the algorithm allocates addresses dynamically
such that the network maintains an &quot;IP resembles topology&quot; state. In such a
state, routing becomes easier and the overall overhead in communication is
reduced. This algorithm is particularly useful for routing protocols which use
topology information to route messages in the network. Our solution is designed
with scalability in mind such that the cost of address assignment to a new node
is independent of the number of nodes in the network.

 <dc:title>Symbolic-Numeric Tools for Analytic Combinatorics in Several Variables</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Analytic combinatorics studies the asymptotic behaviour of sequences through
the analytic properties of their generating functions. This article provides
effective algorithms required for the study of analytic combinatorics in
several variables, together with their complexity analyses. Given a
multivariate rational function we show how to compute its smooth isolated
critical points, with respect to a polynomial map encoding asymptotic
behaviour, in complexity singly exponential in the degree of its denominator.
We introduce a numerical Kronecker representation for solutions of polynomial
systems with rational coefficients and show that it can be used to decide
several properties (0 coordinate, equal coordinates, sign conditions for real
solutions, and vanishing of a polynomial) in good bit complexity. Among the
critical points, those that are minimal---a property governed by inequalities
on the moduli of the coordinates---typically determine the dominant asymptotics
of the diagonal coefficient sequence. When the Taylor expansion at the origin
has all non-negative coefficients (known as the `combinatorial case') and under
regularity conditions, we utilize this Kronecker representation to determine
probabilistically the minimal critical points in complexity singly exponential
in the degree of the denominator, with good control over the exponent in the
bit complexity estimate. Generically in the combinatorial case, this allows one
to automatically and rigorously determine asymptotics for the diagonal
coefficient sequence. Examples obtained with a preliminary implementation show
the wide applicability of this approach.

 <dc:description>  Given a non-convex twice differentiable cost function f, we prove that the

where \nabla^2 f has at least one strictly negative eigenvalue has (Lebesgue)
measure zero, even for cost functions f with non-isolated critical points,
answering an open question in [Lee, Simchowitz, Jordan, Recht, COLT2016].
Moreover, this result extends to forward-invariant convex subspaces, allowing
for weak (non-globally Lipschitz) smoothness assumptions. Finally, we produce
an upper bound on the allowable step-size.

 <dc:description>  We study the fair coexistence of scheduled and random access transmitters
sharing the same frequency channel. Interest in coexistence is topical due to
the need for emerging unlicensed LTE technologies to coexist fairly with WiFi.
However, this interest is not confined to LTE/WiFi as coexistence is likely to
become increasingly commonplace in IoT networks and beyond 5G. In this article
we show that mixing scheduled and random access incurs and inherent
throughput/delay cost, the cost of heterogeneity. We derive the joint
proportional fair rate allocation, which casts useful light on current LTE/WiFi

 <dc:description>  Very recent work introduces an asymptotically fast subdivision algorithm,
denoted ANewDsc, for isolating the real roots of a univariate real polynomial.
The method combines Descartes' Rule of Signs to test intervals for the
existence of roots, Newton iteration to speed up convergence against clusters
of roots, and approximate computation to decrease the required precision. It
achieves record bounds on the worst-case complexity for the considered problem,
matching the complexity of Pan's method for computing all complex roots and
improving upon the complexity of other subdivision methods by several
magnitudes.
  In the article at hand, we report on an implementation of ANewDsc on top of
the RS root isolator. RS is a highly efficient realization of the classical
Descartes method and currently serves as the default real root solver in Maple.
We describe crucial design changes within ANewDsc and RS that led to a
high-performance implementation without harming the theoretical complexity of
the underlying algorithm.
  With an excerpt of our extensive collection of benchmarks, available online
at http://anewdsc.mpi-inf.mpg.de/, we illustrate that the theoretical gain in
performance of ANewDsc over other subdivision methods also transfers into
practice. These experiments also show that our new implementation outperforms
both RS and mature competitors by magnitudes for notoriously hard instances
with clustered roots. For all other instances, we avoid almost any overhead by
integrating additional optimizations and heuristics.

 <dc:title>On sampling theorem with sparse decimated samples: exploring branching
  spectrum degeneracy</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The paper investigates possibility of recovery of sequences from their
decimated subsequences. It is shown that this recoverability is associated with
certain spectrum degeneracy of a new kind, and that a sequences of a general
kind can be approximated by sequences featuring this degeneracy. This is
applied to sparse sampling of continuous time band-limited functions. The paper
shows that these functions allow an arbitrarily close approximation by
functions that can be recovered from sparse equidistant samples with sampling
distance larger than the distance defined by the critical Nyquist rate for the
underlying function. This allows to bypass, in a certain sense, the restriction
on the sampling rate defined by the Nyquist rate.

 <dc:description>  For many wiretap channel models asymptotically optimal coding schemes are
known, but less effort has been put into actual realizations of wiretap codes
for practical parameters. Bounds on the mutual information and error
probability when using coset coding on a Rayleigh fading channel were recently
established by Oggier and Belfiore, and the results in this paper build on
their work. However, instead of using their ultimate inverse norm sum
approximation, a more precise expression for the eavesdropper's probability of
correct decision is used in order to determine a general class of good coset
codes. The code constructions are based on well-rounded lattices arising from
simple geometric criteria. In addition to new coset codes and simulation
results, novel number-theoretic results on well-rounded ideal lattices are
presented.

 <dc:title>An Enhanced Harmony Search Method for Bangla Handwritten Character
  Recognition Using Region Sampling</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Identification of minimum number of local regions of a handwritten character
image, containing well-defined discriminating features which are sufficient for
a minimal but complete description of the character is a challenging task. A
new region selection technique based on the idea of an enhanced Harmony Search
methodology has been proposed here. The powerful framework of Harmony Search
has been utilized to search the region space and detect only the most
informative regions for correctly recognizing the handwritten character. The
proposed method has been tested on handwritten samples of Bangla Basic,
Compound and mixed (Basic and Compound characters) characters separately with
SVM based classifier using a longest run based feature-set obtained from the
image subregions formed by a CG based quad-tree partitioning approach. Applying
this methodology on the above mentioned three types of datasets, respectively
43.75%, 12.5% and 37.5% gains have been achieved in terms of region reduction
and 2.3%, 0.6% and 1.2% gains have been achieved in terms of recognition
accuracy. The results show a sizeable reduction in the minimal number of
descriptive regions as well a significant increase in recognition accuracy for
all the datasets using the proposed technique. Thus the time and cost related
to feature extraction is decreased without dampening the corresponding
recognition accuracy.

 <dc:title>Munchausen Iteration</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present a method for solving polynomial equations over idempotent
omega-continuous semirings. The idea is to iterate over the semiring of
functions rather than the semiring of interest, and only evaluate when needed.
The key operation is substitution. In the initial step, we compute a linear
completion of the system of equations that exhaustively inserts the equations
into one another. With functions as approximants, the following steps insert
the current approximant into itself. Since the iteration improves its precision
by substitution rather than computation we named it Munchausen, after the
fictional baron that pulled himself out of a swamp by his own hair. The first
result shows that an evaluation of the n-th Munchausen approximant coincides
with the 2^n-th Newton approximant. Second, we show how to compute linear
completions with standard techniques from automata theory. In particular, we
are not bound to (but can use) the notion of differentials prominent in Newton
iteration.
