 <dc:description>  This paper introduces pyRecLab, a software library written in C++ with Python
bindings which allows to quickly train, test and develop recommender systems.
Although there are several software libraries for this purpose, only a few let
developers to get quickly started with the most traditional methods, permitting
them to try different parameters and approach several tasks without a
significant loss of performance. Among the few libraries that have all these
features, they are available in languages such as Java, Scala or C#, what is a
disadvantage for less experienced programmers more used to the popular Python
programming language. In this article we introduce details of pyRecLab, showing
as well performance analysis in terms of error metrics (MAE and RMSE) and
train/test time. We benchmark it against the popular Java-based library LibRec,
showing similar results. We expect programmers with little experience and
people interested in quickly prototyping recommender systems to be benefited
from pyRecLab.

 <dc:description>  With the rapid growth of social media, massive misinformation is also
spreading widely on social media, such as microblog, and bring negative effects
to human life. Nowadays, automatic misinformation identification has drawn
attention from academic and industrial communities. For an event on social
media usually consists of multiple microblogs, current methods are mainly based
on global statistical features. However, information on social media is full of
noisy and outliers, which should be alleviated. Moreover, most of microblogs
about an event have little contribution to the identification of
misinformation, where useful information can be easily overwhelmed by useless
information. Thus, it is important to mine significant microblogs for a
reliable misinformation identification method. In this paper, we propose an
Attention-based approach for Identification of Misinformation (AIM). Based on
the attention mechanism, AIM can select microblogs with largest attention
values for misinformation identification. The attention mechanism in AIM
contains two parts: content attention and dynamic attention. Content attention
is calculated based textual features of each microblog. Dynamic attention is
related to the time interval between the posting time of a microblog and the
beginning of the event. To evaluate AIM, we conduct a series of experiments on
the Weibo dataset and the Twitter dataset, and the experimental results show
that the proposed AIM model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  The security of several post-quantum cryptosystems is based on the assumption
that solving a system of multivariate (quadratic) polynomial equations
$p_1=\dots=p_m=0$ over a finite field is hard. Such a system can be solved by
computing a lexicographic Gr\&quot;obner basis of the ideal $(p_1,\dots,p_m)$. The
most efficient algorithms for computing Gr\&quot;obner bases, such as $F_4$ and
$F_5$, transform the problem into several instances of Gaussian elimination.
The computational complexity of these algorithms is not completely understood,
especially when the polynomials $p_1,\dots,p_m$ are non-homogeneous. In this
paper, we prove that this complexity is bounded by a function of the
Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the ideal $(p_1^h,\dots,p_m^h)$ obtained by
homogenizing the input polynomials. This allows us to bound the complexity of
solving a system of polynomial equations when the associated ideal is
zero-dimensional, a common situation in cryptography. More precisely, we show
that the degree of the polynomials involved in the computation a Gr\&quot;obner
basis of a zero-dimensional ideal grows at most linearly in the number of
variables. In combination with some theorems in commutative algebra, our
results also allow us to bound the complexity of some instances of the MinRank
Problem.

 <dc:title>Evaluation of energy consumption of reactive and proactive routing

 <dc:creator>Sultan, Mohamad T.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a distributed, infrastructure-less and
decentralized network. A routing protocol in MANET is used to find routes
between mobile nodes to facilitate communication within the network. Numerous
routing protocols have been proposed for MANET. Those routing protocols are
designed to adaptively accommodate for dynamic unpredictable changes in
network's topology. The mobile nodes in MANET are often powered by limited
batteries and network lifetime relies heavily on the energy consumption of
nodes. In consequence, the lack of a mobile node can lead to network
partitioning. In this paper we analyse, evaluate and measure the energy
efficiency of three prominent MANET routing protocols namely DSR, AODV and OLSR
in addition to modified protocols. These routing protocols follow the reactive
and the proactive routing schemes. A discussion and comparison highlighting
their particular merits and drawbacks are also presented. Evaluation study and
simulations are performed using NS-2 and its accompanying tools for analysis
and investigation of results.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents preliminary results of our work with a major financial
company, where we try to use methods of plan recognition in order to
investigate the interactions of a costumer with the company's online interface.
In this paper, we present the first steps of integrating a plan recognition
algorithm in a real-world application for detecting and analyzing the
interactions of a costumer. It uses a novel approach for plan recognition from
bare-bone UI data, which reasons about the plan library at the lowest
recognition level in order to define the relevancy of actions in our domain,
and then uses it to perform plan recognition.
  We present preliminary results of inference on three different use-cases
modeled by domain experts from the company, and show that this approach manages
to decrease the overload of information required from an analyst to evaluate a
costumer's session - whether this is a malicious or benign session, whether the
intended tasks were completed, and if not - what actions are expected next.

is a special case to assign a particular patient with a specialist physician
cluster at real time. The work is considered soft presentation of the Gaussian
mixture model based on the extracted features supplied by patients. Based on
the likelihood ratio test, the patient is assigned to a specialist physician
cluster. The presented algorithms efficiently handle any size and any numbers
of incoming patient requests and rapidly placed them to the specialist
physician cluster. Hence it smoothly balances the traffic load of patients even
at a hazard situation in the case of natural calamities. The simulation results
are presented with variable size of specialist physician clusters that well
address the issue for randomly growing patient size.

 <dc:title>Making visible the invisible through the analysis of acknowledgements in
  the humanities</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Diaz-Faes, Adrian A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Bordons, Maria</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Purpose: Science is subject to a normative structure that includes how the
contributions and interactions between scientists are rewarded. Authorship and
citations have been the key elements within the reward system of science,
whereas acknowledgements, despite being a well-established element in scholarly
communication, have not received the same attention. This paper aims to put
forward the bearing of acknowledgements in the humanities to bring to the
foreground contributions and interactions that, otherwise, would remain
invisible through traditional indicators of research performance.
  Design/methodology/approach: The study provides a comprehensive framework to
understanding acknowledgements as part of the reward system with a special
focus on its value in the humanities as a reflection of intellectual
indebtedness. The distinctive features of research in the humanities are
outlined and the role of acknowledgements as a source of contributorship
information is reviewed to support these assumptions.
  Findings: Peer interactive communication is the prevailing support thanked in
the acknowledgements of humanities, so the notion of acknowledgements as
super-citations can make special sense in this area. Since single-authored
papers still predominate as publishing pattern in this domain, the study of
acknowledgements might help to understand social interactions and intellectual
influences that lie behind a piece of research and are not visible through
authorship.
  Originality/value: Previous works have proposed and explored the prevailing
acknowledgement types by domain. This paper focuses on the humanities to show
the role of acknowledgements within the reward system and highlight publication
patterns and inherent research features which make acknowledgements
particularly interesting in the area as reflection of the socio-cognitive
structure of research.

 <dc:description>  It is known that Boosting can be interpreted as a gradient descent technique
to minimize an underlying loss function. Specifically, the underlying loss
being minimized by the traditional AdaBoost is the exponential loss, which is
proved to be very sensitive to random noise/outliers. Therefore, several
Boosting algorithms, e.g., LogitBoost and SavageBoost, have been proposed to
improve the robustness of AdaBoost by replacing the exponential loss with some
designed robust loss functions. In this work, we present a new way to robustify
AdaBoost, i.e., incorporating the robust learning idea of Self-paced Learning
(SPL) into Boosting framework. Specifically, we design a new robust Boosting
algorithm based on SPL regime, i.e., SPLBoost, which can be easily implemented
by slightly modifying off-the-shelf Boosting packages. Extensive experiments
and a theoretical characterization are also carried out to illustrate the
merits of the proposed SPLBoost.

 <dc:description>  Finding optimal data for inpainting is a key problem in the context of
partial differential equation based image compression. The data that yields the
most accurate reconstruction is real-valued. Thus, quantisation models are
mandatory to allow an efficient encoding. These can also be understood as
challenging data clustering problems. Although clustering approaches are well
suited for this kind of compression codecs, very few works actually consider
them. Each pixel has a global impact on the reconstruction and optimal data
locations are strongly correlated with their corresponding colour values. These
facts make it hard to predict which feature works best.
  In this paper we discuss quantisation strategies based on popular methods
such as k-means. We are lead to the central question which kind of feature
vectors are best suited for image compression. To this end we consider choices
such as the pixel values, the histogram or the colour map.
  Our findings show that the number of colours can be reduced significantly
without impacting the reconstruction quality. Surprisingly, these benefits do
not directly translate to a good image compression performance. The gains in
the compression ratio are lost due to increased storage costs. This suggests
that it is integral to evaluate the clustering on both, the reconstruction
error and the final file size.

 <dc:description>  We propose a Frank-Wolfe (FW) solver to optimize the symmetric nonnegative
matrix factorization problem under a simplicial constraint. Compared with
existing solutions, this algorithm is extremely simple to implement, and has
almost no hyperparameters to be tuned. Building on the recent advances of FW
algorithms in nonconvex optimization, we prove an $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$
convergence rate to stationary points, via a tight bound $\Theta(n^2)$ on the
curvature constant. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithm. As a side contribution, we construct a simple nonsmooth convex
problem where the FW algorithm fails to converge to the optimum. This result
raises an interesting question about necessary conditions of the success of the
FW algorithm on convex problems.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the analysis of the impact of a floating-point number
precision reduction on the quality of text classification. The precision
reduction of the vectors representing the data (e.g. TF-IDF representation in
our case) allows for a decrease of computing time and memory footprint on
dedicated hardware platforms. The impact of precision reduction on the
classification quality was performed on 5 corpora, using 4 different
classifiers. Also, dimensionality reduction was taken into account. Results
indicate that the precision reduction improves classification accuracy for most
cases (up to 25% of error reduction). In general, the reduction from 64 to 4
bits gives the best scores and ensures that the results will not be worse than
with the full floating-point representation.

 <dc:title>Lattice Codes for Physical Layer Communications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Barreal, Amaro</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Lattices are deceptively simple mathematical structures that have become
indispensable for code design for physical layer communications. While
lattice-related problems are interesting in their own right, the usefulness of
these discrete structures in wireless communications provides additional
motivation for their study and enables a multidisciplinary line of research.
  This thesis is devoted to the study of lattice code design for physical layer
communications. Modern wireless communication networks are required to
accommodate significantly varied types of mobile devices, differing in
available computational power or number of equipped antennas. Additionally, the
density of the networks increases rapidly, and many communication protocols
diverge from the classical direct point-to-point transmission in favor of
allowing for intermediate relays to process and forward data. An important
consequence of this shift towards more sophisticated transmission protocols is
that traditional well-performing codes become futile for modern communications,
thus the study and development of novel codes is called for.
  Yet, however involved a transmission protocol may be, the characteristics of
the physical medium, i.e., the wireless channel, stay unaffected. It is thus
natural that an underlying lattice structure for code design remains crucial.
This thesis consists of several articles considering lattice code design for
four different communication settings relevant in modern wireless
communications.

 <dc:title>A Thorough Formalization of Conceptual Spaces</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The highly influential framework of conceptual spaces provides a geometric
way of representing knowledge. Instances are represented by points in a
high-dimensional space and concepts are represented by convex regions in this
space. After pointing out a problem with the convexity requirement, we propose
a formalization of conceptual spaces based on fuzzy star-shaped sets. Our
formalization uses a parametric definition of concepts and extends the original
framework by adding means to represent correlations between different domains
in a geometric way. Moreover, we define computationally efficient operations on
concepts (intersection, union, and projection onto a subspace) and show that
these operations can support both learning and reasoning processes.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we define and solve the Fair Top-k Ranking problem, in which we
want to determine a subset of k candidates from a large pool of n &gt;&gt; k
candidates, maximizing utility (i.e., select the &quot;best&quot; candidates) subject to
group fairness criteria. Our ranked group fairness definition extends group
fairness using the standard notion of protected groups and is based on ensuring
that the proportion of protected candidates in every prefix of the top-k
ranking remains statistically above or indistinguishable from a given minimum.
  Utility is operationalized in two ways: (i) every candidate included in the
top-$k$ should be more qualified than every candidate not included; and (ii)
for every pair of candidates in the top-k, the more qualified candidate should
be ranked above. An efficient algorithm is presented for producing the Fair
Top-k Ranking, and tested experimentally on existing datasets as well as new
datasets released with this paper, showing that our approach yields small
distortions with respect to rankings that maximize utility without considering
fairness criteria.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm grounded in
statistical tests that can mitigate biases in the representation of an
under-represented group along a ranked list.

 <dc:description>  The use of embedded software is advancing in modern medical devices, so does
its capabilities and complexity. This paradigm shift brings many challenges
such as an increased rate of medical device failures due to software faults. In
this letter, we present a rigorous correct by construction approach for the
trustworthy development of hemodialysis machines, a sub-class of active medical
devices. We show how informal requirements of hemodialysis machines are modeled
and analyzed through a rigorous process and suggest a generalization to a
larger class of active medical devices.

 <dc:title>Model-Driven Development of High-Assurance Active Medical Devices</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mashkoor, Atif</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Advanced medical devices exploit the advantages of embedded software whose
development is subject to compliance with stringent requirements of
standardization and certification regimes due to the critical nature of such
systems. This paper presents initial results and lessons learned from an
ongoing project focusing on the development of a formal model of a subsystem of
a software-controlled safety-critical Active Medical Device (AMD) responsible
for renal replacement therapy. The use of formal approaches for the development
of AMDs is highly recommended by standards and regulations, and motivates the
recent advancement of the state of the art of related methods and tools
including Event-B and Rodin applied in this paper. It is expected that the
presented model development approach and the specification of a high-confidence
medical system will contribute to the still sparse experience base available at
the disposal of the scientific and practitioner community of formal methods and
software engineering.

 <dc:description>  Besides cryptographic secrets, side-channel attacks also leak sensitive user
input. The most accurate attacks exploit cache timings or interrupt information
to monitor keystroke timings and subsequently infer typed words and sentences.
Previously proposed countermeasures fail to prevent keystroke timing attacks as
they do not protect keystroke processing among the entire software stack.
  We close this gap with KeyDrown, a new defense mechanism against keystroke
timing attacks. KeyDrown injects a large number of fake keystrokes in the
kernel to prevent interrupt-based attacks and Prime+Probe attacks on the
kernel. All keystrokes, including fake keystrokes, are carefully propagated
through the shared library in order to hide any cache activity and thus to
prevent Flush+Reload attacks. Finally, we provide additional protection against
Prime+Probe for password input in user space programs. We show that attackers
cannot distinguish fake keystrokes from real keystrokes anymore and we evaluate
KeyDrown on a commodity notebook as well as on two Android smartphones. We show
that KeyDrown eliminates any advantage an attacker can gain from using
interrupt or cache side-channel information.

language. The agents learn to ground the terms in this language in their
environment, and can generalize their behavior at test time to execute new
programs that refer to objects that were not referenced during training. The
agents develop disentangled interpretable representations that allow them to
generalize to a wide variety of zero-shot semantic tasks.

 <dc:description>  Since its unveiling in 2011, schema.org has become the de facto standard for
publishing semantically described structured data on the web, typically in the
form of web page annotations. The increasing adoption of schema.org facilitates
the growth of the web of data, as well as the development of automated agents
that operate on this data. Schema.org is a large heterogeneous vocabulary that
covers many domains. This is obviously not a bug, but a feature, since
schema.org aims to describe almost everything on the web, and the web is huge.
However, the heterogeneity of schema.org may cause a side effect, which is the
challenge of picking the right classes and properties for an annotation in a
certain domain, as well as keeping the annotation semantically consistent. In
this work, we introduce our rule based approach and an implementation of it for
validating schema.org annotations from two aspects: (a) the completeness of the
annotations in terms of a specified domain, (b) the semantic consistency of the
values based on pre-defined rules. We demonstrate our approach in the tourism
domain.

 <dc:title>A Perturbation Scheme for Passivity Verification and Enforcement of
  Parameterized Macromodels</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents an algorithm for checking and enforcing passivity of
behavioral reduced-order macromodels of LTI systems, whose frequency-domain
(scattering) responses depend on external parameters. Such models, which are
typically extracted from sampled input-output responses obtained from numerical
solution of first-principle physical models, usually expressed as Partial
Differential Equations, prove extremely useful in design flows, since they
allow optimization, what-if or sensitivity analyses, and design centering.
  Starting from an implicit parameterization of both poles and residues of the
model, as resulting from well-known model identification schemes based on the
Generalized Sanathanan-Koerner iteration, we construct a parameter-dependent
Skew-Hamiltonian/Hamiltonian matrix pencil. The iterative extraction of purely
imaginary eigenvalues ot fhe pencil, combined with an adaptive sampling scheme
in the parameter space, is able to identify all regions in the
frequency-parameter plane where local passivity violations occur. Then, a
singular value perturbation scheme is setup to iteratively correct the model
coefficients, until all local passivity violations are eliminated. The final
result is a corrected model, which is uniformly passive throughout the
parameter range. Several numerical examples denomstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

 <dc:title>Distributed PCP Theorems for Hardness of Approximation in P</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a new distributed model of probabilistically checkable proofs
(PCP). A satisfying assignment $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ to a CNF formula $\varphi$ is
shared between two parties, where Alice knows $x_1, \dots, x_{n/2}$, Bob knows
$x_{n/2+1},\dots,x_n$, and both parties know $\varphi$. The goal is to have
Alice and Bob jointly write a PCP that $x$ satisfies $\varphi$, while
exchanging little or no information. Unfortunately, this model as-is does not
allow for nontrivial query complexity. Instead, we focus on a non-deterministic
variant, where the players are helped by Merlin, a third party who knows all of
$x$.
  Using our framework, we obtain, for the first time, PCP-like reductions from
the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) to approximation problems in P.
In particular, under SETH we show that there are no truly-subquadratic
approximation algorithms for Bichromatic Maximum Inner Product over
{0,1}-vectors, Bichromatic LCS Closest Pair over permutations, Approximate
Regular Expression Matching, and Diameter in Product Metric. All our
inapproximability factors are nearly-tight. In particular, for the first two
problems we obtain nearly-polynomial factors of $2^{(\log n)^{1-o(1)}}$; only
$(1+o(1))$-factor lower bounds (under SETH) were known before.

 <dc:description>  Automotive industry is moving toward fully electric and hybrid electric
vehicles. Accordingly, energy storage unit is one of the most important blocks
in these electric drives. Battery stacks which contain a number of cells are
being used for supplying the vehicles' energy. Charge equalization for series
connected battery strings has a significant effect on battery life. In this
paper, an adaptive model predictive controller (AMPC) is proposed to manage the
cell equalizing process. The series connected cells' voltages and currents are
collected, then leveraging Recursive Least Square (RLS) method, the future
voltage samples for all of the cells are predicted. MPC controller specifies a
sequence which results in the optimum balancing performance of the proposed
circuit. Simulation results prove that using the suggested algorithm, the
voltage set of the series cells has moved more uniformly.

 <dc:title>Outlier Regularization for Vector Data and L21 Norm Robustness</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jiang, Bo</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ding, Chris</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In many real-world applications, data usually contain outliers. One popular
approach is to use L2,1 norm function as a robust error/loss function. However,
the robustness of L2,1 norm function is not well understood so far. In this
paper, we propose a new Vector Outlier Regularization (VOR) framework to
understand and analyze the robustness of L2,1 norm function. Our VOR function
defines a data point to be outlier if it is outside a threshold with respect to
a theoretical prediction, and regularize it-pull it back to the threshold line.
We then prove that L2,1 function is the limiting case of this VOR with the
usual least square/L2 error function as the threshold shrinks to zero. One
interesting property of VOR is that how far an outlier lies away from its
theoretically predicted value does not affect the final regularization and
analysis results. This VOR property unmasks one of the most peculiar property
of L2,1 norm function: The effects of outliers seem to be independent of how
outlying they are-if an outlier is moved further away from the intrinsic
manifold/subspace, the final analysis results do not change. VOR provides a new
way to understand and analyze the robustness of L2,1 norm function. Applying
VOR to matrix factorization leads to a new VORPCA model. We give a
comprehensive comparison with trace-norm based L21-norm PCA to demonstrate the
advantages of VORPCA.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present the results of a user study on exploratory search
activities in a social science digital library. We conducted a user study with
32 participants with a social sciences background -- 16 postdoctoral
researchers and 16 students -- who were asked to solve a task on searching
related work to a given topic. The exploratory search task was performed in a
10-minutes time slot. The use of certain search activities is measured and
compared to gaze data recorded with an eye tracking device. We use a novel tree
graph representation to visualise the users' search patterns and introduce a
way to combine multiple search session trees. The tree graph representation is
capable to create one single tree for multiple users and to identify common
search patterns. In addition, the information behaviour of students and
postdoctoral researchers is being compared. The results show that search
activities on the stratagem level are frequently utilised by both user groups.
The most heavily used search activities were keyword search, followed by
browsing through references and citations, and author searching. The eye
tracking results showed an intense examination of documents metadata,
especially on the level of citations and references. When comparing the group
of students and postdoctoral researchers we found significant differences
regarding gaze data on the area of the journal name of the seed document. In
general, we found a tendency of the postdoctoral researchers to examine the
metadata records more intensively with regards to dwell time and the number of
fixations.

 <dc:description>  Brain is an organ that controls activities of all the parts of the body.
Recognition of automated brain tumor in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a
difficult task due to complexity of size and location variability. This
automatic method detects all the type of cancer present in the body. Previous
methods for tumor are time consuming and less accurate. In the present work,
statistical analysis morphological and thresholding techniques are used to
process the images obtained by MRI. Feed-forward back-prop neural network is
used to classify the performance of tumors part of the image. This method
results high accuracy and less iterations detection which further reduces the
consumption time.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces THUMT, an open-source toolkit for neural machine
translation (NMT) developed by the Natural Language Processing Group at
Tsinghua University. THUMT implements the standard attention-based
encoder-decoder framework on top of Theano and supports three training
criteria: maximum likelihood estimation, minimum risk training, and
semi-supervised training. It features a visualization tool for displaying the
relevance between hidden states in neural networks and contextual words, which
helps to analyze the internal workings of NMT. Experiments on Chinese-English
datasets show that THUMT using minimum risk training significantly outperforms
GroundHog, a state-of-the-art toolkit for NMT.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses the design of a novel compliant in-pipe climbing modular
robot for small diameter pipes. The robot consists of a kinematic chain of 3
OmniCrawler modules with a link connected in between 2 adjacent modules via
compliant joints. While the tank-like crawler mechanism provides good traction
on low friction surfaces, its circular cross-section makes it holonomic. The
holonomic motion assists it to re-align in a direction to avoid obstacles
during motion as well as overcome turns with a minimal energy posture.
Additionally, the modularity enables it to negotiate T-junction without motion
singularity. The compliance is realized using 4 torsion springs incorporated in
joints joining 3 modules with 2 links. For a desirable pipe diameter (\text{\O}
75mm), the springs' stiffness values are obtained by formulating a constraint
optimization problem which has been simulated in ADAMS MSC and further
validated on a real robot prototype. In order to negotiate smooth vertical
bends and friction coefficient variations in pipes, the design was later
modified by replacing springs with series elastic actuators (SEA) at 2 of the 4
joints.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks have achieved a great success in the recent
years. Although, the way to maximize the performance of the convolutional
neural networks still in the beginning. Furthermore, the optimization of the
size and the time that need to train the convolutional neural networks is very
far away from reaching the researcher's ambition. In this paper, we proposed a
new convolutional neural network that combined several techniques to boost the
optimization of the convolutional neural network in the aspects of speed and
size. As we used our previous model Residual-CNDS (ResCNDS), which solved the
problems of slower convergence, overfitting, and degradation, and compressed
it. The outcome model called Residual-Squeeze-CNDS (ResSquCNDS), which we
demonstrated on our sold technique to add residual learning and our model of
compressing the convolutional neural networks. Our model of compressing adapted
from the SQUEEZENET model, but our model is more generalizable, which can be
applied almost to any neural network model, and fully integrated into the
residual learning, which addresses the problem of the degradation very
successfully. Our proposed model trained on very large-scale MIT
Places365-Standard scene datasets, which backing our hypothesis that the new
compressed model inherited the best of the previous ResCNDS8 model, and almost
get the same accuracy in the validation Top-1 and Top-5 with 87.64% smaller in
size and 13.33% faster in the training time.

 <dc:description>  Generative models have long been the dominant approach for speech
recognition. The success of these models however relies on the use of
sophisticated recipes and complicated machinery that is not easily accessible
to non-practitioners. Recent innovations in Deep Learning have given rise to an
alternative - discriminative models called Sequence-to-Sequence models, that
can almost match the accuracy of state of the art generative models. While
these models are easy to train as they can be trained end-to-end in a single
step, they have a practical limitation that they can only be used for offline
recognition. This is because the models require that the entirety of the input
sequence be available at the beginning of inference, an assumption that is not
valid for instantaneous speech recognition. To address this problem, online
sequence-to-sequence models were recently introduced. These models are able to
start producing outputs as data arrives, and the model feels confident enough
to output partial transcripts. These models, like sequence-to-sequence are
causal - the output produced by the model until any time, $t$, affects the
features that are computed subsequently. This makes the model inherently more
powerful than generative models that are unable to change features that are
computed from the data. This paper highlights two main contributions - an
improvement to online sequence-to-sequence model training, and its application
to noisy settings with mixed speech from two speakers.

 <dc:title>Massive Connectivity with Massive MIMO-Part II: Achievable Rate
  Characterization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Liang</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Yu, Wei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This two-part paper aims to quantify the cost of device activity detection in
an uplink massive connectivity scenario with a large number of devices but
device activities are sporadic. Part I of this paper shows that in an
asymptotic massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) regime, device
activity detection can always be made perfect. Part II of this paper
subsequently shows that despite the perfect device activity detection, there is
nevertheless significant cost due to device detection in terms of overall
achievable rate, because of the fact that non-orthogonal pilot sequences have
to be used in order to accommodate the large number of potential devices,
resulting in significantly larger channel estimation error as compared to
conventional massive MIMO systems with orthogonal pilots. Specifically, this
paper characterizes each active user's achievable rate using random matrix
theory under either maximal-ratio combining (MRC) or minimum mean-squared error
(MMSE) receive beamforming at the base-station (BS), assuming the statistics of
their estimated channels as derived in Part I. The characterization of user
rate also allows the optimization of pilot sequences length. Moreover, in
contrast to the conventional massive MIMO system, the MMSE beamforming is shown
to achieve much higher rate than the MRC beamforming for the massive
connectivity scenario under consideration. Finally, this paper illustrates the
necessity of user scheduling for rate maximization when the number of active
users is larger than the number of antennas at the BS.

 <dc:title>Massive Connectivity with Massive MIMO-Part I: Device Activity Detection

 <dc:creator>Liu, Liang</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Yu, Wei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This two-part paper considers an uplink massive device communication scenario
in which a large number of devices are connected to a base-station (BS), but
user traffic is sporadic so that in any given coherence interval, only a subset
of users are active. The objective is to quantify the cost of active user
detection and channel estimation and to characterize the overall achievable
rate of a grant-free two-phase access scheme in which device activity detection
and channel estimation are performed jointly using pilot sequences in the first
phase and data is transmitted in the second phase. In order to accommodate a
large number of simultaneously transmitting devices, this paper studies an
asymptotic regime where the BS is equipped with a massive number of antennas.
The main contributions of Part I of this paper are as follows. First, we note
that as a consequence of having a large pool of potentially active devices but
limited coherence time, the pilot sequences cannot all be orthogonal. However,
despite this non-orthogonality, this paper shows that in the asymptotic massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) regime, both the missed device detection
and the false alarm probabilities for activity detection can always be made to
go to zero by utilizing compressed sensing techniques that exploit sparsity in
the user activity pattern. Part II of this paper further characterizes the
achievable rates using the proposed scheme and quantifies the cost of using
non-orthogonal pilot sequences for channel estimation in achievable rates.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a new approach for multiple access (MA) in fifth generation
(5G) of cellular networks called power domain sparse code multiple access
(PSMA) is proposed. In PSMA, we adopt both the power domain and the code domain
to transmit multiple users' signals over a subcarrier simultaneously. In such a
model, the same SCMA codebook can be used by multiple users where, for these
users, power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) technique is used
to send signals non-orthogonally. Although different SCMA codebooks are
orthogonal and produce no interference over each other, the same codebook used
by multiple users produces interference over these users. We investigate the
signal model as well as the receiver and transmitter of the PSMA method. To
evaluate the performance of PSMA, we consider a heterogeneous cellular network
(HetNet). In this case our design objective is to maximize the system sum rate
of the network subject to some system level and QoS constraints such as
transmit power constraints. We formulate the proposed resource allocation
problem as an optimization problem and solve it by successive convex
approximation (SCA) techniques. Moreover, we compare PSMA with sparse code
multiple access (SCMA) and PD-NOMA from the performance and computational
complexity perspective. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is
investigated using numerical results. We show that by a reasonable increase in
complexity, PSMA can improve the spectral efficiency about 50\% compared to
SCMA and PD-NOMA.

 <dc:description>  We study vertex colourings of digraphs so that no out-neighbourhood is
monochromatic and call such a colouring an {\bf out-colouring}. The problem of
deciding whether a given digraph has an out-colouring with only two colours
(called a 2-out-colouring) is ${\cal
  NP}$-complete. We show that for every choice of positive integers $r,k$ there
exists a $k$-strong bipartite tournament which needs at least $r$ colours in
every out-colouring. Our main results are on tournaments and semicomplete
digraphs. We prove that, except for the Paley tournament $P_7$, every strong
semicomplete digraph of minimum out-degree at least 3 has a 2-out-colouring.
Furthermore, we show that every semicomplete digraph on at least 7 vertices has
a 2-out-colouring if and only if it has a {\bf balanced} such colouring, that
is, the difference between the number of vertices that receive colour 1 and
colour 2 is at most one. In the second half of the paper we consider the
generalization of 2-out-colourings to vertex partitions $(V_1,V_2)$ of a
digraph $D$ so that each of the three digraphs induced by respectively, the
vertices of $V_1$, the vertices of $V_2$ and all arcs between $V_1$ and $V_2$
have minimum out-degree $k$ for a prescribed integer $k\geq 1$. Using
probabilistic arguments we prove that there exists an absolute positive
constant $c$ so that every semicomplete digraph of minimum out-degree at least
$2k+c\sqrt{k}$ has such a partition. This is tight up to the value of $c$.

 <dc:description>  Fog-aided network architectures for 5G systems encompass wireless edge nodes,
referred to as remote radio systems (RRSs), as well as remote cloud center
(RCC) processors, which are connected to the RRSs via a fronthaul access
network. RRSs and RCC are operated via Network Functions Virtualization (NFV),
enabling a flexible split of network functionalities that adapts to network
parameters such as fronthaul latency and capacity. This work focuses on uplink
communications and investigates the cloud-edge allocation of two important
network functions, namely the control functionality of rate selection and the
data-plane function of decoding. Three functional splits are considered: (i)
Distributed Radio Access Network (D-RAN), in which both functions are
implemented in a decentralized way at the RRSs, (ii) Cloud RAN (C-RAN), in
which instead both functions are carried out centrally at the RCC, and (iii) a
new functional split, referred to as Fog RAN (F-RAN), with separate
decentralized edge control and centralized cloud data processing. The model
under study consists of a time-varying uplink channel in which the RCC has
global but delayed channel state information (CSI) due to fronthaul latency,
while the RRSs have local but more timely CSI. Using the adaptive sum-rate as
the performance criterion, it is concluded that the F-RAN architecture can
provide significant gains in the presence of user mobility.

 <dc:title>Informed Sampling for Asymptotically Optimal Path Planning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Anytime almost-surely asymptotically optimal planners, such as RRT*,
incrementally find paths to every state in the search domain. This is
inefficient once an initial solution is found as then only states that can
provide a better solution need to be considered. Exact knowledge of these
states requires solving the problem but can be approximated with heuristics.
  This paper formally defines these sets of states and demonstrates how they
can be used to analyze arbitrary planning problems. It uses the well-known
$L^2$ norm (i.e., Euclidean distance) to analyze minimum-path-length problems
and shows that existing approaches decrease in effectiveness factorially (i.e.,
faster than exponentially) with state dimension. It presents a method to
address this curse of dimensionality by directly sampling the prolate
hyperspheroids (i.e., symmetric $n$-dimensional ellipses) that define the $L^2$
informed set.
  The importance of this direct informed sampling technique is demonstrated
with Informed RRT*. This extension of RRT* has less theoretical dependence on
state dimension and problem size than existing techniques and allows for linear
convergence on some problems. It is shown experimentally to find better
solutions faster than existing techniques on both abstract planning problems
and HERB, a two-arm manipulation robot.

 <dc:title>The Evaluation of Circuit Selection Methods on Tor</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Tor provides anonymity online by routing traffic through encrypted tunnels,
called circuits, over paths of anonymizing relays. To enable users to connect
to their selected destination servers without waiting for the circuit to be
build, the Tor client maintains a few circuits at all times. Nevertheless, Tor
is slower to use than directly connecting to the destination server. In this
paper, we propose to have the Tor client measure the performance of the
pre-built circuits and select the fastest circuits for users to send their
traffic over. To this end, we define and evaluate nine metrics for selecting
which pre-built circuit to use based on different combinations of circuit
length, Round Trip Time (RTT), and congestion. We also explore the effect on
performance of the number of pre-built circuits at the time of the selection.
Through whole-network experiments in Shadow, we show that using circuit RTT
with at least three pre-built circuits allows the Tor client to identify fast
circuits and improves median time to first byte (TTFB) by 22% over Tor and 15%
over congestion-aware routing, the state-of-the-art in Tor circuit selection.
We evaluate the security of the proposed circuit selection mechanism against
both a relay-level and a network-level adversary and find no loss of security
compared with Tor.

 <dc:description>  We focus on nonconvex and nonsmooth minimization problems with a composite
objective, where the differentiable part of the objective is freed from the
usual and restrictive global Lipschitz gradient continuity assumption. This
longstanding smoothness restriction is pervasive in first order methods (FOM),
and was recently circumvent for convex composite optimization by Bauschke,
Bolte and Teboulle, through a simple and elegant framework which captures, all
at once, the geometry of the function and of the feasible set. Building on this
work, we tackle genuine nonconvex problems. We first complement and extend
their approach to derive a full extended descent lemma by introducing the
notion of smooth adaptable functions. We then consider a Bregman-based proximal
gradient methods for the nonconvex composite model with smooth adaptable
functions, which is proven to globally converge to a critical point under
natural assumptions on the problem's data. To illustrate the power and
potential of our general framework and results, we consider a broad class of
quadratic inverse problems with sparsity constraints which arises in many
fundamental applications, and we apply our approach to derive new globally
convergent schemes for this class.

 <dc:description>  Inspired by the recent evolution of deep neural networks (DNNs) in machine
learning, we explore their application to PL-related topics. This paper is the
first step towards this goal; we propose a proof-synthesis method for the
negation-free propositional logic in which we use a DNN to obtain a guide of
proof search. The idea is to view the proof-synthesis problem as a translation
from a proposition to its proof. We train seq2seq, which is a popular network
in neural machine translation, so that it generates a proof encoded as a
$\lambda$-term of a given proposition. We implement the whole framework and
empirically observe that a generated proof term is close to a correct proof in
terms of the tree edit distance of AST. This observation justifies using the
output from a trained seq2seq model as a guide for proof search.

 <dc:description>  The Independent Cascade Model (ICM) is a widely studied model that aims to
capture the dynamics of the information diffusion in social networks and in
general complex networks. In this model, we can distinguish between active
nodes which spread the information and inactive ones. The process starts from a
set of initially active nodes called seeds. Recursively, currently active nodes
can activate their neighbours according to a probability distribution on the
set of edges. After a certain number of these recursive cycles, a large number
of nodes might become active. The process terminates when no further node gets
activated. Starting from the work of Domingos and Richardson, several studies
have been conducted with the aim of shaping a given diffusion process so as to
maximize the number of activated nodes at the end of the process. One of the
most studied problems has been formalized by Kempe et al. and consists in
finding a set of initial seeds that maximizes the expected number of active
nodes under a budget constraint. In this paper we study a generalization of the
problem of Kempe et al. in which we are allowed to spend part of the budget to
create new edges incident to the seeds. That is, the budget can be spent to buy
seeds or edges according to a cost function. The problem does not admin a PTAS,
unless $P=NP$. We propose two approximation algorithms: the former one gives an
approximation ratio that depends on the edge costs and increases when these
costs are high; the latter algorithm gives a constant approximation guarantee
which is greater than that of the first algorithm when the edge costs can be
small.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the complexity of counting the number of integer points in
tropical polytopes, and the complexity of calculating their volume. We study
the tropical analogue of the outer parallel body and establish bounds for its
volume. We deduce that there is no approximation algorithm of factor
$\alpha=2^{\text{poly}(m,n)}$ for the volume of a tropical polytope given by
$n$ vertices in a space of dimension $m$, unless P$=$NP. Neither is there such
an approximation algorithm for counting the number of integer points in
tropical polytopes described by vertices. If follows that approximating these
values for tropical polytopes is more difficult than for classical polytopes.
Our proofs use a reduction from the problem of calculating the tropical rank.
For tropical polytopes described by inequalities we prove that counting the
number of integer points and calculating the volume are $\#$P-hard.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a finite-strain hyperviscoplastic constitutive model
within a thermodynamically consistent framework for peat which was categorised
as a material with both rate-dependent and thermodynamic equilibrium hysteresis
based on the data reported in the literature. The model was implemented
numerically using implicit time integration and verified against analytical
solutions under simplified conditions. Experimental studies on the undrained
relaxation and loading-unloading-reloading behaviour of an undisturbed fibrous
peat were carried out to define the thermodynamic equilibrium state during
deviatoric loading as a prerequisite for further modelling, to fit particularly
those model parameters related to solid matrix properties, and to validate the
proposed model under undrained conditions. This validation performed by
comparison to experimental results showed that the hyperviscoplastic model
could simulate undrained triaxial compression tests carried out at five
different strain rates with loading/unloading relaxation steps.

 <dc:description>  Pairwise clustering, in general, partitions a set of items via a known
similarity function. In our treatment, clustering is modeled as a transductive
prediction problem. Thus rather than beginning with a known similarity
function, the function instead is hidden and the learner only receives a random
sample consisting of a subset of the pairwise similarities. An additional set
of pairwise side-information may be given to the learner, which then determines
the inductive bias of our algorithms. We measure performance not based on the
recovery of the hidden similarity function, but instead on how well we classify
each item. We give tight bounds on the number of misclassifications. We provide
two algorithms. The first algorithm SACA is a simple agglomerative clustering
algorithm which runs in near linear time, and which serves as a baseline for
our analyses. Whereas the second algorithm, RGCA, enables the incorporation of
side-information which may lead to improved bounds at the cost of a longer
running time.

 <dc:description>  The inner structure of a material is called microstructure. It stores the
genesis of a material and determines all its physical and chemical properties.
While microstructural characterization is widely spread and well known, the
microstructural classification is mostly done manually by human experts, which
opens doors for huge uncertainties. Since the microstructure could be a
combination of different phases with complex substructures its automatic
classification is very challenging and just a little work in this field has
been carried out. Prior related works apply mostly designed and engineered
features by experts and classify microstructure separately from feature
extraction step. Recently Deep Learning methods have shown surprisingly good
performance in vision applications by learning the features from data together
with the classification step. In this work, we propose a deep learning method
for microstructure classification in the examples of certain microstructural
constituents of low carbon steel. This novel method employs pixel-wise
segmentation via Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNN) accompanied by
max-voting scheme. Our system achieves 93.94% classification accuracy,
drastically outperforming the state-of-the-art method of 48.89% accuracy,
indicating the effectiveness of pixel-wise approaches. Beyond the success
presented in this paper, this line of research offers a more robust and first
of all objective way for the difficult task of steel quality appreciation.

 <dc:description>  Continuous-time Markov chains with alarms (ACTMCs) allow for alarm events
that can be non-exponentially distributed. Within parametric ACTMCs, the
parameters of alarm-event distributions are not given explicitly and can be
subject of parameter synthesis. An algorithm solving the $\varepsilon$-optimal
parameter synthesis problem for parametric ACTMCs with long-run average
optimization objectives is presented. Our approach is based on reduction of the
problem to finding long-run average optimal strategies in semi-Markov decision
processes (semi-MDPs) and sufficient discretization of parameter (i.e., action)
space. Since the set of actions in the discretized semi-MDP can be very large,
a straightforward approach based on explicit action-space construction fails to
solve even simple instances of the problem. The presented algorithm uses an
enhanced policy iteration on symbolic representations of the action space. The
soundness of the algorithm is established for parametric ACTMCs with
alarm-event distributions satisfying four mild assumptions that are shown to
hold for uniform, Dirac and Weibull distributions in particular, but are
satisfied for many other distributions as well. An experimental implementation
shows that the symbolic technique substantially improves the efficiency of the
synthesis algorithm and allows to solve instances of realistic size.

 <dc:description>  Trial-and-error based reinforcement learning (RL) has seen rapid advancements
in recent times, especially with the advent of deep neural networks. However,
the majority of autonomous RL algorithms either rely on engineered features or
a large number of interactions with the environment. Such a large number of
interactions may be impractical in many real-world applications. For example,
robots are subject to wear and tear and, hence, millions of interactions may
change or damage the system. Moreover, practical systems have limitations in
the form of the maximum torque that can be safely applied. To reduce the number
of system interactions while naturally handling constraints, we propose a
model-based RL framework based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). In
particular, we propose to learn a probabilistic transition model using Gaussian
Processes (GPs) to incorporate model uncertainties into long-term predictions,
thereby, reducing the impact of model errors. We then use MPC to find a control
sequence that minimises the expected long-term cost. We provide theoretical
guarantees for the first-order optimality in the GP-based transition models
with deterministic approximate inference for long-term planning. The proposed
framework demonstrates superior data efficiency and learning rates compared to
the current state of the art.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, numerous research efforts have been dedicated towards
developing efficient implantable devices for brain stimulation. However, there
are limitations and challenges with the current technologies. Firstly, the
stimulation of neurons currently is possible through implantable electrodes but
limited to a population of neurons. Secondly, a major hurdle lies in developing
miniature devices that can last for a lifetime in the patient's brain. In
parallel, Optogenetics has emerged proposing the stimulation of neurons using
light by means of optical fibers inserted through the skull. Many challenges
are thus introduced in terms of suitability to patient's lifestyle and
biocompatibility. We have recently proposed the concept of wireless optogenetic
nanonetworking devices (WiOptND), addressing these long-term deployment
problems, and at the same time targeting single neuron stimulation [1]. The
WiOptND is equipped with a miniature LED that is able to stimulate a
genetically engineered neuron while harvesting energy from ultrasonic
vibrations. This paper investigates how light propagates in the brain tissue,
and based on the power required to emit sufficient intensity for stimulation,
an energy harvesting circuitry is designed. A number of charging protocols are
also proposed to maximize energy efficiency while ensuring minimum number of
neural spike misfirings. These protocols include the Charge and Fire, the
Predictive Sliding Detection Window, and its variant Markov-Chain based
Time-Delay Patterns. Simulation results show the drop of stimulation ratio for
25% and more stable trend in its efficiency ratio are exhibited on Markov-Chain
based Time-Delay Patterns compared to Change and Fire. The results show the
feasibility of utilizing WiOptND for long-term implants, and a new direction
towards precise stimulation of neurons in the cortical columns of the brain.

 <dc:description>  The virtualization and softwarization of modern computer networks introduces
interesting new opportunities for a more flexible placement of network
functions and middleboxes (firewalls, proxies, traffic optimizers, virtual
switches, etc.). This paper studies approximation algorithms for the
incremental deployment of a minimum number of middleboxes at optimal locations,
such that capacity constraints at the middleboxes and length constraints on the
communication routes are respected. Our main contribution is a new, purely
combinatorial and rigorous proof for the submodularity of the function
maximizing the number of communication requests that can be served by a given
set of middleboxes. Our proof allows us to devise a deterministic approximation
algorithm which uses an augmenting path approach to compute the submodular
function. This algorithm does not require any changes to the locations of
existing middleboxes or the preemption of previously served communication pairs
when additional middleboxes are deployed, previously accepted communication
pairs just can be handed over to another middlebox. It is hence particularly
attractive for incremental deployments.We prove that the achieved
polynomial-time approximation bound is optimal, unless P = NP. This paper also
initiates the study of a weighted problem variant, in which entire groups of
nodes need to communicate via a middlebox (e.g., a multiplexer or a shared
object), possibly at different rates. We present an LP relaxation and
randomized rounding algorithm for this problem, leveraging an interesting
connection to scheduling.

 <dc:description>  Adams' extension of parsing expression grammars enables specifying
indentation sensitivity using two non-standard grammar constructs ---
indentation by a binary relation and alignment. This paper proposes a
step-by-step transformation of well-formed Adams' grammars for elimination of
the alignment construct from the grammar. The idea that alignment could be
avoided was suggested by Adams but no process for achieving this aim has been
described before.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, instead of the usual Gaussian noise assumption,
$t$-distribution noise is assumed. A Maximum Likelihood Estimator using the
most recent N measurements is proposed for the Auto-Regressive-Moving-Average
with eXogenous input (ARMAX) process with this assumption. The proposed
estimator is robust to outliers because the `thick tail' of the t-distribution
reduces the effect of large errors in the likelihood function. Instead of
solving the resulting nonlinear estimator numerically, the Influence Function
is used to formulate a computationally efficient recursive solution, which
reduces to the traditional Moving Horizon Estimator when the noise is Gaussian.
The formula for the variance of the estimate is derived. This formula shows
explicitly how the variance of the estimate is affected by the number of
measurements and noise variance. The simulation results show that the proposed
estimator has smaller variance and is more robust to outliers than the Moving
Window Least-Squares Estimator. For the same accuracy, the proposed estimator
is an order of magnitude faster than the particle filter.

 <dc:description>  The neural network is a powerful computing framework that has been exploited
by biological evolution and by humans for solving diverse problems. Although
the computational capabilities of neural networks are determined by their
structure, the current understanding of the relationships between a neural
network's architecture and function is still primitive. Here we reveal that
neural network's modular architecture plays a vital role in determining the
neural dynamics and memory performance of the network. In particular, we
demonstrate that there exists an optimal modularity for memory performance,
where a balance between local cohesion and global connectivity is established,
allowing optimally modular networks to remember longer. Our results suggest
that insights from dynamical analysis of neural networks and information
spreading processes can be leveraged to better design neural networks and may
shed light on the brain's modular organization.

 <dc:description>  Compacting orthogonal drawings is a challenging task. Usually algorithms try
to compute drawings with small area or edge length while preserving the
underlying orthogonal shape. We present a one-dimensional compaction algorithm
that alters the orthogonal shape of edges for better geometric results. An
experimental evaluation shows that we were able to reduce the total edge length
and the drawing area, but at the expense of additional bends.

 <dc:title>Can the Journal Impact Factor Be Used as a Criterion for the Selection

 <dc:description>  Early in researchers' careers, it is difficult to assess how good their work
is or how important or influential the scholars will eventually be. Hence,
funding agencies, academic departments, and others often use the Journal Impact
Factor (JIF) of where the authors have published to assess their work and
provide resources and rewards for future work. The use of JIFs in this way has
been heavily criticized, however. Using a large data set with many thousands of
publication profiles of individual researchers, this study tests the ability of
the JIF (in its normalized variant) to identify, at the beginning of their
careers, those candidates who will be successful in the long run. Instead of
bare JIFs and citation counts, the metrics used here are standardized according
to Web of Science subject categories and publication years. The results of the
study indicate that the JIF (in its normalized variant) is able to discriminate
between researchers who published papers later on with a citation impact above
or below average in a field and publication year - not only in the short term,
but also in the long term. However, the low to medium effect sizes of the
results also indicate that the JIF (in its normalized variant) should not be
used as the sole criterion for identifying later success: other criteria, such
as the novelty and significance of the specific research, academic
distinctions, and the reputation of previous institutions, should also be
considered.

 <dc:description>  Classical matrix perturbation results, such as Weyl's theorem for eigenvalues
and the Davis-Kahan theorem for eigenvectors, are general purpose. These
classical bounds are tight in the worst case, but in many settings sub-optimal
in the typical case. In this paper, we present perturbation bounds which
consider the nature of the perturbation and its interaction with the
unperturbed structure in order to obtain significant improvements over the
classical theory in many scenarios, such as when the perturbation is random. We
demonstrate the utility of these new results by analyzing perturbations in the
stochastic blockmodel where we derive much tighter bounds than provided by the
classical theory. We use our new perturbation theory to show that a very simple
and natural clustering algorithm -- whose analysis was difficult using the
classical tools -- nevertheless recovers the communities of the blockmodel
exactly even in very sparse graphs.

 <dc:description>  In Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) two major approaches have been
followed . While one utilizes engineered features such as
mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients (MFCCs), the other uses learned features
that are the outcome of an optimization algorithm. I-vectors are the result of
a modeling technique that usually takes engineered features as input. It has
been shown that standard MFCCs extracted from monaural audio signals lead to
i-vectors that exhibit poor performance, especially on indoor acoustic scenes.
At the same time, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well known for their
ability to learn features by optimizing their filters. They have been applied
on ASC and have shown promising results. In this paper, we first propose a
novel multi-channel i-vector extraction and scoring scheme for ASC, improving
their performance on indoor and outdoor scenes. Second, we propose a CNN
architecture that achieves promising ASC results. Further, we show that
i-vectors and CNNs capture complementary information from acoustic scenes.
Finally, we propose a hybrid system for ASC using multi-channel i-vectors and
CNNs by utilizing a score fusion technique. Using our method, we participated
in the ASC task of the DCASE-2016 challenge. Our hybrid approach achieved 1 st
rank among 49 submissions, substantially improving the previous state of the
art.

 <dc:title>A Divergence Bound for Hybrids of MCMC and Variational Inference and an
  Application to Langevin Dynamics and SGVI</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Domke, Justin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Two popular classes of methods for approximate inference are Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference. MCMC tends to be accurate if run
for a long enough time, while variational inference tends to give better
approximations at shorter time horizons. However, the amount of time needed for
MCMC to exceed the performance of variational methods can be quite high,
motivating more fine-grained tradeoffs. This paper derives a distribution over
variational parameters, designed to minimize a bound on the divergence between
the resulting marginal distribution and the target, and gives an example of how
to sample from this distribution in a way that interpolates between the
behavior of existing methods based on Langevin dynamics and stochastic gradient
variational inference (SGVI).

 <dc:description>  Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer type in women, and while its
survival rate is generally high the aesthetic outcome is an increasingly
important factor when evaluating different treatment alternatives. 3D scanning
and reconstruction techniques offer a flexible tool for building detailed and
accurate 3D breast models that can be used both pre-operatively for surgical
planning and post-operatively for aesthetic evaluation. This paper aims at
comparing the accuracy of low-cost 3D scanning technologies with the
significantly more expensive state-of-the-art 3D commercial scanners in the
context of breast 3D reconstruction. We present results from 28 synthetic and
clinical RGBD sequences, including 12 unique patients and an anthropomorphic
phantom demonstrating the applicability of low-cost RGBD sensors to real
clinical cases. Body deformation and homogeneous skin texture pose challenges
to the studied reconstruction systems. Although these should be addressed
appropriately if higher model quality is warranted, we observe that low-cost
sensors are able to obtain valuable reconstructions comparable to the
state-of-the-art within an error margin of 3 mm.

the cloud with useless massive data streams that can trigger bottlenecks [1].
Managing data flow is becoming an important part of the IoMT because it will
dictate in which platform analytical tasks should run in the future. Data flows
are usually a sequence of out-of-order tuples with a high data input rate, and
mobility analytics requires a real-time flow of data in both directions, from
the edge to the cloud, and vice-versa. Before pulling the data streams to the
cloud, edge data stream processing is needed for detecting missing, broken, and
duplicated tuples in addition to recognize tuples whose arrival time is out of
order. Analytical tasks such as data filtering, data cleaning and low-level
data contextualization can be executed at the edge of a network. In contrast,
more complex analytical tasks such as graph processing can be deployed in the
cloud, and the results of ad-hoc queries and streaming graph analytics can be
pushed to the edge as needed by a user application. Graphs are efficient
representations used in mobility analytics because they unify knowledge about
connectivity, proximity and interaction among moving things. This poster
describes the preliminary results from our experimental prototype developed for
supporting transit systems, in which edge and cloud computing are combined to
process transit data streams forwarded from fog nodes into a cloud. The
motivation of this research is to understand how to perform meaningfulness
mobility analytics on transit feeds by combining cloud and fog computing
architectures in order to improve fleet management, mass transit and remote
asset monitoring

 <dc:description>  In this work, we aim at developing an extractive summarizer in the
multi-document setting. We implement a rank based sentence selection using
continuous vector representations along with key-phrases. Furthermore, we
propose a model to tackle summary coherence for increasing readability. We
conduct experiments on the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 2004
datasets using ROUGE toolkit. Our experiments demonstrate that the methods
bring significant improvements over the state of the art methods in terms of
informativity and coherence.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new formulation of the Hidden Parameter Markov Decision
Process (HiP-MDP), a framework for modeling families of related tasks using
low-dimensional latent embeddings. Our new framework correctly models the joint
uncertainty in the latent parameters and the state space. We also replace the
original Gaussian Process-based model with a Bayesian Neural Network, enabling
more scalable inference. Thus, we expand the scope of the HiP-MDP to
applications with higher dimensions and more complex dynamics.

 <dc:description>  Deep generative networks provide a powerful tool for modeling complex data in
a wide range of applications. In inverse problems that use these networks as
generative priors on data, one must often perform inference of the inputs of
the networks from the outputs. Inference is also required for sampling during
stochastic training on these generative models. This paper considers inference
in a deep stochastic neural network where the parameters (e.g., weights, biases
and activation functions) are known and the problem is to estimate the values
of the input and hidden units from the output. While several approximate
algorithms have been proposed for this task, there are few analytic tools that
can provide rigorous guarantees in the reconstruction error. This work presents
a novel and computationally tractable output-to-input inference method called
Multi-Layer Vector Approximate Message Passing (ML-VAMP). The proposed
algorithm, derived from expectation propagation, extends earlier AMP methods
that are known to achieve the replica predictions for optimality in simple
linear inverse problems. Our main contribution shows that the mean-squared
error (MSE) of ML-VAMP can be exactly predicted in a certain large system limit
(LSL) where the numbers of layers is fixed and weight matrices are random and
orthogonally-invariant with dimensions that grow to infinity. ML-VAMP is thus a
principled method for output-to-input inference in deep networks with a
rigorous and precise performance achievability result in high dimensions.

 <dc:description>  We are increasingly surrounded by artificially intelligent technology that
takes decisions and executes actions on our behalf. This creates a pressing
need for general means to communicate with, instruct and guide artificial
agents, with human language the most compelling means for such communication.
To achieve this in a scalable fashion, agents must be able to relate language
to the world and to actions; that is, their understanding of language must be
grounded and embodied. However, learning grounded language is a notoriously
challenging problem in artificial intelligence research. Here we present an
agent that learns to interpret language in a simulated 3D environment where it
is rewarded for the successful execution of written instructions. Trained via a
combination of reinforcement and unsupervised learning, and beginning with
minimal prior knowledge, the agent learns to relate linguistic symbols to
emergent perceptual representations of its physical surroundings and to
pertinent sequences of actions. The agent's comprehension of language extends
beyond its prior experience, enabling it to apply familiar language to
unfamiliar situations and to interpret entirely novel instructions. Moreover,
the speed with which this agent learns new words increases as its semantic
knowledge grows. This facility for generalising and bootstrapping semantic
knowledge indicates the potential of the present approach for reconciling
ambiguous natural language with the complexity of the physical world.

 <dc:description>  The success of autonomous systems will depend upon their ability to safely
navigate human-centric environments. This motivates the need for a real-time,
probabilistic forecasting algorithm for pedestrians, cyclists, and other agents
since these predictions will form a necessary step in assessing the risk of any
action. This paper presents a novel approach to probabilistic forecasting for
pedestrians based on weighted sums of ordinary differential equations that are
learned from historical trajectory information within a fixed scene. The
resulting algorithm is embarrassingly parallel and is able to work at real-time
speeds using a naive Python implementation. The quality of predicted locations
of agents generated by the proposed algorithm is validated on a variety of
examples and considerably higher than existing state of the art approaches over
long time horizons.

 <dc:description>  In the prize-collecting Steiner forest (PCSF) problem, we are given an
undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, edge costs $\{c_e\geq 0\}_{e\in E}$, terminal pairs
$\{(s_i,t_i)\}_{i=1}^k$, and penalties $\{\pi_i\}_{i=1}^k$ for each terminal
pair; the goal is to find a forest $F$ to minimize $c(F)+\sum_{i:
(s_i,t_i)\text{ not connected in }F}\pi_i$. The Steiner forest problem can be
viewed as the special case where $\pi_i=\infty$ for all $i$. It was widely
believed that the integrality gap of the natural (and well-studied)
linear-programming (LP) relaxation for PCSF is at most 2. We dispel this belief
by showing that the integrality gap of this LP is at least $9/4$. This holds
even for planar graphs. We also show that using this LP, one cannot devise a
Lagrangian-multiplier-preserving (LMP) algorithm with approximation guarantee
better than $4$. Our results thus show a separation between the integrality
gaps of the LP-relaxations for prize-collecting and non-prize-collecting (i.e.,
standard) Steiner forest, as well as the approximation ratios achievable
relative to the optimal LP solution by LMP- and non-LMP- approximation
algorithms for PCSF. For the special case of prize-collecting Steiner tree
(PCST), we prove that the natural LP relaxation admits basic feasible solutions
with all coordinates of value at most $1/3$ and all edge variables positive.
Thus, we rule out the possibility of approximating PCST with guarantee better
than $3$ using a direct iterative rounding method.

 <dc:title>Adaptive OFDM Index Modulation for Two-Hop Relay-Assisted Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an adaptive orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) index modulation (IM) scheme for two-hop relay networks. In
contrast to the traditional OFDM IM scheme with a deterministic and fixed
mapping scheme, in this proposed adaptive OFDM IM scheme, the mapping schemes
between a bit stream and indices of active subcarriers for the first and second
hops are adaptively selected by a certain criterion. As a result, the active
subcarriers for the same bit stream in the first and second hops can be varied
in order to combat slow frequency-selective fading. In this way, the system
reliability can be enhanced. Additionally, considering the fact that a relay
device is normally a simple node, which may not always be able to perform
mapping scheme selection due to limited processing capability, we also propose
an alternative adaptive methodology in which the mapping scheme selection is
only performed at the source and the relay will simply utilize the selected
mapping scheme without changing it. The analyses of average outage probability,
network capacity and symbol error rate (SER) are given in closed form for
decode-and-forward (DF) relaying networks and are substantiated by numerical
results generated by Monte Carlo simulations.

 <dc:description>  We describe a framework for deriving and analyzing online optimization
algorithms that incorporate adaptive, data-dependent regularization, also
termed preconditioning. Such algorithms have been proven useful in stochastic
optimization by reshaping the gradients according to the geometry of the data.
Our framework captures and unifies much of the existing literature on adaptive
online methods, including the AdaGrad and Online Newton Step algorithms as well
as their diagonal versions. As a result, we obtain new convergence proofs for
these algorithms that are substantially simpler than previous analyses. Our
framework also exposes the rationale for the different preconditioned updates
used in common stochastic optimization methods.

 <dc:description>  Virtual Reality (VR) becomes accessible to mimic a &quot;real-like&quot; world now.
People who have a VR experience usually can be impressed by the immersive
feeling, they might consider themselves are actually existed in the VR space.
Self-consciousness is important for people to identify their own characters in
VR space, and illusory ownership can help people to &quot;build&quot; their &quot;bodies&quot;. The
rubber hand illusion can convince us a fake hand made by rubber is a part of
our bodies under certain circumstances. Researches about autoscopic phenomena
extend this illusory to the so-called full body illusion. We conducted 3 type
of experiments to study the illusory ownership in VR space as it shows in
Figure 1, and we learned: Human body must receive the synchronized visual
signal and somatosensory stimulus at the same time; The visual signal must be
the first person perceptive; the subject and the virtual body needs to be the
same height as much as possible. All these illusory ownerships accompanied by
the body temperature decreases, where the body is stimulated.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes K-NRM, a kernel based neural model for document ranking.
Given a query and a set of documents, K-NRM uses a translation matrix that
models word-level similarities via word embeddings, a new kernel-pooling
technique that uses kernels to extract multi-level soft match features, and a
learning-to-rank layer that combines those features into the final ranking
score. The whole model is trained end-to-end. The ranking layer learns desired
feature patterns from the pairwise ranking loss. The kernels transfer the
feature patterns into soft-match targets at each similarity level and enforce
them on the translation matrix. The word embeddings are tuned accordingly so
that they can produce the desired soft matches. Experiments on a commercial
search engine's query log demonstrate the improvements of K-NRM over prior
feature-based and neural-based states-of-the-art, and explain the source of
K-NRM's advantage: Its kernel-guided embedding encodes a similarity metric
tailored for matching query words to document words, and provides effective
multi-level soft matches.

 <dc:description>  Observational learning is a type of learning that occurs as a function of
observing, retaining and possibly replicating or imitating the behaviour of
another agent. It is a core mechanism appearing in various instances of social
learning and has been found to be employed in several intelligent species,
including humans. In this paper, we investigate to what extent the explicit
modelling of other agents is necessary to achieve observational learning
through machine learning. Especially, we argue that observational learning can
emerge from pure Reinforcement Learning (RL), potentially coupled with memory.
Through simple scenarios, we demonstrate that an RL agent can leverage the
information provided by the observations of an other agent performing a task in
a shared environment. The other agent is only observed through the effect of
its actions on the environment and never explicitly modeled. Two key aspects
are borrowed from observational learning: i) the observer behaviour needs to
change as a result of viewing a 'teacher' (another agent) and ii) the observer
needs to be motivated somehow to engage in making use of the other agent's
behaviour. The later is naturally modeled by RL, by correlating the learning
agent's reward with the teacher agent's behaviour.

 <dc:title>Most Ligand-Based Benchmarks Measure Overfitting Rather than Accuracy</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Undetected overfitting can occur when there are significant redundancies
between training and validation data. We describe AVE, a new measure of
training-validation redundancy for ligand-based classification problems that
accounts for the similarity amongst inactive molecules as well as active. We
investigated nine widely-used benchmarks for virtual screening and QSAR, and
show that the amount of AVE bias strongly correlates with the performance of
ligand-based predictive methods irrespective of the predicted property,
chemical fingerprint, similarity measure, or previously-applied unbiasing
techniques. Therefore, it is likely that the previously-reported performance of
most ligand-based methods can be explained by overfitting to benchmarks rather
than good prospective accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Recently we have shown that an architecture based on resistive processing
unit (RPU) devices has potential to achieve significant acceleration in deep
neural network (DNN) training compared to today's software-based DNN
implementations running on CPU/GPU. However, currently available device
candidates based on non-volatile memory technologies do not satisfy all the
requirements to realize the RPU concept. Here, we propose an analog CMOS-based
RPU design (CMOS RPU) which can store and process data locally and can be
operated in a massively parallel manner. We analyze various properties of the
CMOS RPU to evaluate the functionality and feasibility for acceleration of DNN
training.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that closed-form analytical solutions for AC power flow
equations do not exist in general. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional
holomorphic embedding method (MDHEM) to obtain an explicit approximate
analytical AC power-flow solution by finding a physical germ solution and
arbitrarily embedding each power, each load or groups of loads with respective
scales. Based on the MDHEM, the complete approximate analytical solutions to
the power flow equations in the high-dimensional space become achievable, since
the voltage vector of each bus can be explicitly expressed by a convergent
multivariate power series of all the loads. Unlike the traditional iterative
methods for power flow calculation and inaccurate sensitivity analysis method
for voltage control, the algebraic variables of a power system in all operating
conditions can be prepared offline and evaluated online by only plugging in the
values of any operating conditions into the scales of the non-linear
multivariate power series. Case studies implemented on the 4-bus test system
and the IEEE 14-bus standard system confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

 <dc:description>  Commercial photon-counting modules based on actively quenched solid-state
avalanche photodiode sensors are used in a wide variety of applications.
Manufacturers characterize their detectors by specifying a small set of
parameters, such as detection efficiency, dead time, dark counts rate,
afterpulsing probability and single-photon arrival-time resolution (jitter).
However, they usually do not specify the range of conditions over which these
parameters are constant or present a sufficient description of the
characterization process. In this work, we perform a few novel tests on two
commercial detectors and identify an additional set of imperfections that must
be specified to sufficiently characterize their behavior. These include
rate-dependence of the dead time and jitter, detection delay shift, and
&quot;twilighting.&quot; We find that these additional non-ideal behaviors can lead to
unexpected effects or strong deterioration of the performance of a system using
these devices. We explain their origin by an in-depth analysis of the active
quenching process. To mitigate the effects of these imperfections, a
custom-built detection system is designed using a novel active quenching
circuit. Its performance is compared against two commercial detectors in a fast
quantum key distribution system with hyper-entangled photons and a random
number generator.

 <dc:title>Co-Fusion: Real-time Segmentation, Tracking and Fusion of Multiple

 <dc:creator>R&#xfc;nz, Martin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Agapito, Lourdes</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce Co-Fusion, a dense SLAM system that takes a live
stream of RGB-D images as input and segments the scene into different objects
(using either motion or semantic cues) while simultaneously tracking and
reconstructing their 3D shape in real time. We use a multiple model fitting
approach where each object can move independently from the background and still
be effectively tracked and its shape fused over time using only the information
from pixels associated with that object label. Previous attempts to deal with
dynamic scenes have typically considered moving regions as outliers, and
consequently do not model their shape or track their motion over time. In
contrast, we enable the robot to maintain 3D models for each of the segmented
objects and to improve them over time through fusion. As a result, our system
can enable a robot to maintain a scene description at the object level which
has the potential to allow interactions with its working environment; even in
the case of dynamic scenes.

 <dc:title>An Empirical Model of Packet Processing Delay of the Open vSwitch</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Network virtualization offers flexibility by decoupling virtual network from
the underlying physical network. Software-Defined Network (SDN) could utilize
the virtual network. For example, in Software-Defined Networks, the entire
network can be run on commodity hardware and operating systems that use virtual
elements. However, this could present new challenges of data plane performance.
In this paper, we present an empirical model of the packet processing delay of
a widely used OpenFlow virtual switch, the Open vSwitch. In the empirical
model, we analyze the effect of varying Random Access Memory (RAM) and network
parameters on the performance of the Open vSwitch. Our empirical model captures
the non-network processing delays, which could be used in enhancing the network
modeling and simulation.

 <dc:description>  Bandwidth optimization for real-time video traffic transmission through the
proxy server is a challenging issue for the next- generation network. The self
- control of the traffic rate at the proxy server is based on the relative data
present in the proxy server or to import the require data from the remote data
center node. The smoothness of traffic transmission is highly depended on the
self -configuration in the cache memory at the proxy server by used of
optimized page replacement procedure. The web proxy cache memory is finite in
size. The system performance is highly depended upon the self- optimization of
the traffic rate at the proxy server. This paper presents the effect of zipf-
distribution parameters to the outbound request and the effect of the
parameters to measure the bandwidth requirement for the desire video file. This
paper presents some of the relevant results for bandwidth optimization and the
effect of traffic control during active transmission for various sizes of video
file through the proxy server.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a word-entity duet framework for utilizing knowledge
bases in ad-hoc retrieval. In this work, the query and documents are modeled by
word-based representations and entity-based representations. Ranking features
are generated by the interactions between the two representations,
incorporating information from the word space, the entity space, and the
cross-space connections through the knowledge graph. To handle the
uncertainties from the automatically constructed entity representations, an
attention-based ranking model AttR-Duet is developed. With back-propagation
from ranking labels, the model learns simultaneously how to demote noisy
entities and how to rank documents with the word-entity duet. Evaluation
results on TREC Web Track ad-hoc task demonstrate that all of the four-way
interactions in the duet are useful, the attention mechanism successfully
steers the model away from noisy entities, and together they significantly
outperform both word-based and entity-based learning to rank systems.

 <dc:description>  An interactive session of video-on-demand (VOD) streaming procedure deserves
smooth data transportation for the viewer, irrespective of their geographic
location. To access the required video, bandwidth management during the video
objects transportation at any interactive session is a mandatory prerequisite.
It has been observed in the domain likes movie on demand, electronic
encyclopedia, interactive games, and educational resources. The required data
is imported from the distributed storage servers through the high speed
backbone network. This paper presents the viewer driven session based
multi-user model with respect to the overlay mesh network. In virtue of
reality, the direct implication of this work elaborately shows the required
bandwidth is a causal part in the video on demand system. The analytic model of
session based single viewer bandwidth requirement model presents the bandwidth
requirement for any interactive session like, pause, move slow, rewind, skip
some number of frames, or move fast with some constant number of frames. This
work presents the bandwidth requirement model for any interactive session that
brings the trade-off in data-transportation and storage costs for different
system resources and also for the various system configurations.

 <dc:description>  Underutilization of computing resources and high power consumption are two
primary challenges in the domain of Cloud resource management. This paper deals
with these challenges through offline, migration impact-aware, multi-objective
dynamic Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation in the context of large-scale
virtualized data center environments. The problem is formulated as an NP-hard
discrete combinatorial optimization problem with simultaneous objectives of
minimizing resource wastage, power consumption, and the associated VM migration
overhead. Since dynamic VM consolidation through VM live migrations have
negative impacts on hosted applications performance and data center components,
a VM live migration overhead estimation technique is proposed, which takes into
account pragmatic migration parameters and overhead factors. In order to tackle
scalability issues, a hierarchical, decentralized dynamic VM consolidation
framework is presented that helps to localize migration-related network traffic
and reduce network cost. Moreover, a multi-objective, dynamic VM consolidation
algorithm is proposed by utilizing the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
metaheuristic, with integration of the proposed VM migration overhead
estimation technique. Comprehensive performance evaluation makes it evident
that the proposed dynamic VM consolidation approach outpaces the
state-of-the-art offline, migration-aware dynamic VM consolidation algorithm
across all performance metrics by reducing the overall power consumption by up
to 47%, resource wastage by up to 64%, and migration overhead by up to 83%.

 <dc:title>Pseudocodeword-Free Criterion for Codes with Cycle-Free Tanner Graph</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kositwattanarerk, Wittawat</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Iterative decoding and linear programming decoding are guaranteed to converge
to the maximum-likelihood codeword when the underlying Tanner graph is
cycle-free. Therefore, cycles are usually seen as the culprit of low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes. In this paper, we argue in the context of graph
cover pseudocodeword that, for a code that permits a cycle-free Tanner graph,
cycles have no effect on error performance as long as they are a part of
redundant rows. Specifically, we characterize all parity-check matrices that
are pseudocodeword-free for such class of codes.

 <dc:description>  In this digital era, one thing that still holds the convention is a printed
archive. Printed documents find their use in many critical domains such as
contract papers, legal tenders and proof of identity documents. As more
advanced printing, scanning and image editing techniques are becoming
available, forgeries on these legal tenders pose a serious threat. Ability to
easily and reliably identify source printer of a printed document can help a
lot in reducing this menace. During printing procedure, printer hardware
introduces certain distortions in printed characters' locations and shapes
which are invisible to naked eyes. These distortions are referred as geometric
distortions, their profile (or signature) is generally unique for each printer
and can be used for printer classification purpose. This paper proposes a set
of features for characterizing text-line-level geometric distortions, referred
as geometric distortion signatures and presents a novel system to use them for
identification of the origin of a printed document. Detailed experiments
performed on a set of thirteen printers demonstrate that the proposed system
achieves state of the art performance and gives much higher accuracy under
small training size constraint. For four training and six test pages of three
different fonts, the proposed method gives 99\% classification accuracy.

 <dc:title>BB-Graph: A New Subgraph Isomorphism Algorithm for Efficiently Querying
  Big Graph Databases</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  With the emergence of the big data concept, the big graph database model has
become very popular since it provides strong modeling for complex applications
and fast querying, especially for the cases that require costly join operations
in RDBMs. However, it is a big challenge to find all exact matches of a query
graph in a big graph database, which is known as the subgraph isomorphism
problem. Although a number of related studies exist in literature, there is
need for a better algorithm that works efficiently for all types of queries
since the subgraph isomorphism problem is NP-hard. The current subgraph
isomorphism approaches have been built on Ullmann's idea of focusing on the
strategy of pruning out the irrelevant candidates. Nevertheless, for some graph
databases and queries, the existing pruning techniques are not adequate to
handle some of the complex queries. Moreover, many of those existing algorithms
need large indices that cause extra memory consumption. Motivated by these, we
introduce a new subgraph isomorphism algorithm, namely BB-Graph, for querying
big graph databases in an efficient manner without requiring a large data
structure to be stored in main memory. We test and compare our proposed
BB-Graph algorithm with two popular existing ones, GraphQL and Cypher of Neo4j.
Our experiments are done on a very big graph database application (Population
Database) and the publicly available World Cup graph database application. We
show that our algorithm performs better than those that we use for comparison
in this study, for most of the query types.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: This is a big data study on subgraph isomorphism problem. We
  developed a new algorithm. We have studied on very big Neo4j graph databases</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  Zeckendorf's theorem states that every positive integer can be written
uniquely as a sum of nonconsecutive Fibonacci numbers. This theorem induces a
binary numeration system for the positive integers known as Fibonacci coding.
Fibonacci code is a variable-length prefix code that is robust against
insertion and deletion errors and is useful in data transmission and data
compression. In this paper, we generalize the theorem of Zeckendorf and prove
that every element of a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module can be represented as a sum of
elements from a Fibonacci sequence of higher order. Immediate applications of
these results include a Fibonacci coding for free $\mathbb{Z}$-modules, where
encoding and decoding algorithms are obtained naturally from the approach of
our theorems.

 <dc:description>  We consider estimation of worker skills from worker-task interaction data
(with unknown labels) for the single-coin crowd-sourcing binary classification
model in symmetric noise. We define the (worker) interaction graph whose nodes
are workers and an edge between two nodes indicates whether or not the two
workers participated in a common task. We show that skills are asymptotically
identifiable if and only if an appropriate limiting version of the interaction
graph is irreducible and has odd-cycles. We then formulate a weighted rank-one
optimization problem to estimate skills based on observations on an
irreducible, aperiodic interaction graph. We propose a gradient descent scheme
and show that for such interaction graphs estimates converge asymptotically to
the global minimum. We characterize noise robustness of the gradient scheme in
terms of spectral properties of signless Laplacians of the interaction graph.
We then demonstrate that a plug-in estimator based on the estimated skills
achieves state-of-art performance on a number of real-world datasets. Our
results have implications for rank-one matrix completion problem in that
gradient descent can provably recover $W \times W$ rank-one matrices based on
$W+1$ off-diagonal observations of a connected graph with a single odd-cycle.

 <dc:title>Grilliot's trick in Nonstandard Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sanders, Sam</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The technique known as Grilliot's trick constitutes a template for explicitly
defining the Turing jump functional $(\exists^2)$ in terms of a given
effectively discontinuous type two functional. In this paper, we discuss the
standard extensionality trick: a technique similar to Grilliot's trick in
Nonstandard Analysis. This nonstandard trick proceeds by deriving from the
existence of certain nonstandard discontinuous functionals, the Transfer
principle from Nonstandard analysis limited to $\Pi_1^0$-formulas; from this
(generally ineffective) implication, we obtain an effective implication
expressing the Turing jump functional in terms of a discontinuous functional
(and no longer involving Nonstandard Analysis). The advantage of our
nonstandard approach is that one obtains effective content without paying
attention to effective content. We also discuss a new class of functionals
which all seem to fall outside the established categories. These functionals
directly derive from the Standard Part axiom of Nonstandard Analysis.

 <dc:description>  Anomaly detection is one of the frequent and important subroutines deployed
in large-scale data processing systems. Even being a well-studied topic,
existing techniques for unsupervised anomaly detection require storing
significant amounts of data, which is prohibitive from memory and latency
perspective. In the big-data world existing methods fail to address the new set
of memory and latency constraints. In this paper, we propose ACE (Arrays of
(locality-sensitive) Count Estimators) algorithm that can be 60x faster than
the ELKI package~\cite{DBLP:conf/ssd/AchtertBKSZ09}, which has the fastest
implementation of the unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms. ACE algorithm
requires less than $4MB$ memory, to dynamically compress the full data
information into a set of count arrays. These tiny $4MB$ arrays of counts are
sufficient for unsupervised anomaly detection. At the core of the ACE
algorithm, there is a novel statistical estimator which is derived from the
sampling view of Locality Sensitive Hashing(LSH). This view is significantly
different and efficient than the widely popular view of LSH for near-neighbor
search. We show the superiority of ACE algorithm over 11 popular baselines on 3
benchmark datasets, including the KDD-Cup99 data which is the largest available
benchmark comprising of more than half a million entries with ground truth
anomaly labels.

 <dc:description>  We propose a neural multi-document summarization (MDS) system that
incorporates sentence relation graphs. We employ a Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) on the relation graphs, with sentence embeddings obtained from Recurrent
Neural Networks as input node features. Through multiple layer-wise
propagation, the GCN generates high-level hidden sentence features for salience
estimation. We then use a greedy heuristic to extract salient sentences while
avoiding redundancy. In our experiments on DUC 2004, we consider three types of
sentence relation graphs and demonstrate the advantage of combining sentence
relations in graphs with the representation power of deep neural networks. Our
model improves upon traditional graph-based extractive approaches and the
vanilla GRU sequence model with no graph, and it achieves competitive results
against other state-of-the-art multi-document summarization systems.

 <dc:description>  In diffusion MRI (dMRI), a good sampling scheme is important for efficient
acquisition and robust reconstruction. Diffusion weighted signal is normally
acquired on single or multiple shells in q-space. Signal samples are typically
distributed uniformly on different shells to make them invariant to the
orientation of structures within tissue, or the laboratory coordinate frame.
The Electrostatic Energy Minimization (EEM) method, originally proposed for
single shell sampling scheme in dMRI, was recently generalized to multi-shell
schemes, called Generalized EEM (GEEM). GEEM has been successfully used in the
Human Connectome Project (HCP). However, EEM does not directly address the goal
of optimal sampling, i.e., achieving large angular separation between sampling
points. In this paper, we propose a more natural formulation, called Spherical
Code (SC), to directly maximize the minimal angle between different samples in
single or multiple shells. We consider not only continuous problems to design
single or multiple shell sampling schemes, but also discrete problems to
uniformly extract sub-sampled schemes from an existing single or multiple shell
scheme, and to order samples in an existing scheme. We propose five algorithms
to solve the above problems, including an incremental SC (ISC), a sophisticated
greedy algorithm called Iterative Maximum Overlap Construction (IMOC), an 1-Opt
greedy method, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) method, and a
Constrained Non-Linear Optimization (CNLO) method. To our knowledge, this is
the first work to use the SC formulation for single or multiple shell sampling
schemes in dMRI. Experimental results indicate that SC methods obtain larger
angular separation and better rotational invariance than the state-of-the-art
EEM and GEEM. The related codes and a tutorial have been released in DMRITool.

 <dc:description>  EPG graphs, introduced by Golumbic et al. in 2009, are edge-intersection
graphs of paths on an orthogonal grid. The class $B_k$-EPG is the subclass of
EPG graphs where the path on the grid associated to each vertex has at most $k$
bends. Epstein et al. showed in 2013 that computing a maximum clique in
$B_1$-EPG graphs is polynomial. As remarked in [Heldt et al., 2014], when the
number of bends is at least $4$, the class contains $2$-interval graphs for
which computing a maximum clique is an NP-hard problem. The complexity status
of the Maximum Clique problem remains open for $B_2$ and $B_3$-EPG graphs. In
this paper, we show that we can compute a maximum clique in polynomial time in
$B_2$-EPG graphs given a representation of the graph.
  Moreover, we show that a simple counting argument provides a
${2(k+1)}$-approximation for the coloring problem on $B_k$-EPG graphs without
knowing the representation of the graph. It generalizes a result of [Epstein et
al, 2013] on $B_1$-EPG graphs (where the representation was needed).

 <dc:description>  Blackboard systems are motivated by the popular view of task forces as
brainstorming groups in which specialists write promising ideas to solve a
problem in a central blackboard. Here we study a minimal model of blackboard
system designed to solve cryptarithmetic puzzles, where hints are posted
anonymously on a public display (standard blackboard) or are posted together
with information about the reputations of the agents that posted them
(reputation blackboard). We find that the reputation blackboard always
outperforms the standard blackboard, which, in turn, always outperforms the
independent search. The asymptotic distribution of the computational cost of
the search, which is proportional to the total number of agent updates required
to find the solution of the puzzle, is an exponential distribution for those
three search heuristics. Only for the reputation blackboard we find a
nontrivial dependence of the mean computational cost on the system size and, in
that case, the optimal performance is achieved by a single agent working alone,
indicating that, though the blackboard organization can produce impressive
performance gains when compared with the independent search, it is not very
supportive of cooperative work.

 <dc:description>  In the last few years, we have seen the transformative impact of deep
learning in many applications, particularly in speech recognition and computer
vision. Inspired by Google's Inception-ResNet deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) for image classification, we have developed &quot;Chemception&quot;, a deep CNN for
the prediction of chemical properties, using just the images of 2D drawings of
molecules. We develop Chemception without providing any additional explicit
chemistry knowledge, such as basic concepts like periodicity, or advanced
features like molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We then show how
Chemception can serve as a general-purpose neural network architecture for
predicting toxicity, activity, and solvation properties when trained on a
modest database of 600 to 40,000 compounds. When compared to multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) deep neural networks trained with ECFP fingerprints,
Chemception slightly outperforms in activity and solvation prediction and
slightly underperforms in toxicity prediction. Having matched the performance
of expert-developed QSAR/QSPR deep learning models, our work demonstrates the
plausibility of using deep neural networks to assist in computational chemistry
research, where the feature engineering process is performed primarily by a
deep learning algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Trends change rapidly in today's world, prompting this key question: What is
the mechanism behind the emergence of new trends? By representing real-world
dynamic systems as complex networks, the emergence of new trends can be
symbolized by vertices that &quot;shine.&quot; That is, at a specific time interval in a
network's life, certain vertices become increasingly connected to other
vertices. This process creates new high-degree vertices, i.e., network stars.
Thus, to study trends, we must look at how networks evolve over time and
determine how the stars behave. In our research, we constructed the largest
publicly available network evolution dataset to date, which contains 38,000
real-world networks and 2.5 million graphs. Then, we performed the first
precise wide-scale analysis of the evolution of networks with various scales.
Three primary observations resulted: (a) links are most prevalent among
vertices that join a network at a similar time; (b) the rate that new vertices
join a network is a central factor in molding a network's topology; and (c) the
emergence of network stars (high-degree vertices) is correlated with
fast-growing networks. We applied our learnings to develop a flexible
network-generation model based on large-scale, real-world data. This model
gives a better understanding of how stars rise and fall within networks, and is
applicable to dynamic systems both in nature and society.

 <dc:title>Ergodic Fading MIMO Dirty Paper and Broadcast Channels: Capacity Bounds
  and Lattice Strategies</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hindy, Ahmed</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Nosratinia, Aria</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) version of the dirty paper channel is
studied, where the channel input and the dirt experience the same fading
process and the fading channel state is known at the receiver (CSIR). This
represents settings where signal and interference sources are co-located, such
as in the broadcast channel. First, a variant of Costa's dirty paper coding
(DPC) is presented, whose achievable rates are within a constant gap to
capacity for all signal and dirt powers. Additionally, a lattice coding and
decoding scheme is proposed, whose decision regions are independent of the
channel realizations. Under Rayleigh fading, the gap to capacity of the lattice
coding scheme vanishes with the number of receive antennas, even at finite
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Thus, although the capacity of the fading dirty
paper channel remains unknown, this work shows it is not far from its dirt-free
counterpart. The insights from the dirty paper channel directly lead to
transmission strategies for the two-user MIMO broadcast channel (BC), where the
transmitter emits a superposition of desired and undesired (dirt) signals with
respect to each receiver. The performance of the lattice coding scheme is
analyzed under different fading dynamics for the two users, showing that
high-dimensional lattices achieve rates close to capacity.

 <dc:description>  In this work a system for recognizing grasp points in RGB-D images is
proposed. This system is intended to be used by a domestic robot when deploying
clothes lying at a random position on a table. By taking into consideration
that the grasp points are usually near key parts of clothing, such as the waist
of pants or the neck of a shirt. The proposed system attempts to detect these
key parts first, using a local multivariate contour that adapts its shape
accordingly. Then, the proposed system applies the Vessel Enhancement filter to
identify wrinkles in the clothes, allowing to compute a roughness index for the
clothes. Finally, by mixing (i) the key part contours and (ii) the roughness
information obtained by the vessel filter, the system is able to recognize
grasp points for unfolding a piece of clothing. The recognition system is
validated using realistic RGB-D images of different cloth types.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the design and implementation of complex Reinforcement
Learning (RL) behaviors where multi-dimensional action spaces are involved, as
well as the need to execute the behaviors in real-time using robotic platforms
with limited computational resources and training times. For this purpose, we
propose the use of decentralized RL, in combination with finite support basis
functions as alternatives to Gaussian RBF, in order to alleviate the effects of
the curse of dimensionality on the action and state spaces respectively, and to
reduce the computation time. As testbed, a RL based controller for the in-walk
kick in NAO robots, a challenging and critical problem for soccer robotics, is
used. The reported experiments show empirically that our solution saves up to
99.94% of execution time and 98.82% of memory consumption during execution,
without diminishing performance compared to classical approaches.

computationally demanding algorithms in an external platform while preserving
robot's autonomy and mobility. The platform has the form of a backpack, which
can be 3D printed and replicated, and holds an ODROID XU4 board to process
algorithms externally with ROS compatibility. We provide also a software bridge
between the B-Human's framework and ROS to have access to the robot's sensors
close to real-time. We tested the platform in several robotics applications
such as data logging, visual SLAM, and robot vision with deep learning
techniques. The CAD model, hardware specifications and software are available

 <dc:title>Index Search Algorithms for Databases and Modern CPUs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gross, Florian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Over the years, many different indexing techniques and search algorithms have
been proposed, including CSS-trees, CSB+ trees, k-ary binary search, and fast
architecture sensitive tree search. There have also been papers on how best to
set the many different parameters of these index structures, such as the node
size of CSB+ trees.
  These indices have been proposed because CPU speeds have been increasing at a
dramatically higher rate than memory speeds, giving rise to the Von Neumann
CPU--Memory bottleneck. To hide the long latencies caused by memory access, it
has become very important to well-utilize the features of modern CPUs. In order
to drive down the average number of CPU clock cycles required to execute CPU
instructions, and thus increase throughput, it has become important to achieve
a good utilization of CPU resources. Some of these are the data and instruction
caches, and the translation lookaside buffers. But it also has become important
to avoid branch misprediction penalties, and utilize vectorization provided by
CPUs in the form of SIMD instructions.
  While the layout of index structures has been heavily optimized for the data
cache of modern CPUs, the instruction cache has been neglected so far. In this
paper, we present NitroGen, a framework for utilizing code generation for
speeding up index traversal in main memory database systems. By bringing
together data and code, we make index structures use the dormant resource of
the instruction cache. We show how to combine index compilation with previous
approaches, such as binary tree search, cache-sensitive tree search, and the
architecture-sensitive tree search presented by Kim et al.

 <dc:description>  Although representation learning methods developed within the framework of
traditional neural networks are relatively mature, developing a spiking
representation model remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes an
event-based method to train a feedforward spiking neural network (SNN) for
extracting visual features. The method introduces a novel
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule and a threshold
adjustment rule that are derived from a vector quantization-like objective
function subject to a sparsity constraint. The STDP rule is obtained by the
gradient of a vector quantization criterion that is converted to spike-based,
spatio-temporally local update rules in a spiking network of leaky,
integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. Independence and sparsity of the model are
achieved by the threshold adjustment rule and by a softmax function
implementing inhibition in the representation layer consisting of
WTA-thresholded spiking neurons. Together, these mechanisms implement a form of
spike-based, competitive learning. Two sets of experiments are performed on the
MNIST and natural image datasets. The results demonstrate a sparse spiking
visual representation model with low reconstruction loss comparable with
state-of-the-art visual coding approaches, yet our rule is local in both time
and space, thus biologically plausible and hardware friendly.

 <dc:description>  Several studies indicate that attracting students to research careers
requires to engage them from early undergraduate years. Following this
paradigm, our Engineering School has developed an undergraduate research
program that allows students to enroll in research in exchange for course
credits. Moreover, we developed a web portal to inform students about the
program and the opportunities, but participation remains lower than expected.
In order to promote student engagement, we attempt to build a personalized
recommender system of research opportunities to undergraduates. With this goal
in mind we investigate two tasks. First, one that identifies students that are
more willing to participate on this kind of program. A second task is
generating a personalized list of recommendations of research opportunities for
each student. To evaluate our approach, we perform a simulated prediction
experiment with data from our School, which has more than 4,000 active
undergraduate students nowadays. Our results indicate that there is a big
potential to create a personalized recommender system for this purpose. Our
results can be used as a baseline for colleges seeking strategies to encourage
research activities within undergraduate students.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in robots with limited computational
capabilities, and to propose general design guidelines for their use. In
addition, two different CNN based NAO robot detectors that are able to run in
real-time while playing soccer are proposed. One of the detectors is based on
the XNOR-Net and the other on the SqueezeNet. Each detector is able to process
a robot object-proposal in ~1ms, with an average number of 1.5 proposals per
frame obtained by the upper camera of the NAO. The obtained detection rate is
~97%.

 <dc:description>  Performing high level cognitive tasks requires the integration of feature
maps with drastically different structure. In Visual Question Answering (VQA)
image descriptors have spatial structures, while lexical inputs inherently
follow a temporal sequence. The recently proposed Multimodal Compact Bilinear
pooling (MCB) forms the outer products, via count-sketch approximation, of the
visual and textual representation at each spatial location. While this
procedure preserves spatial information locally, outer-products are taken
independently for each fiber of the activation tensor, and therefore do not
include spatial context. In this work, we introduce multi-dimensional sketch
({MD-sketch}), a novel extension of count-sketch to tensors. Using this new
formulation, we propose Multimodal Compact Tensor Pooling (MCT) to fully
exploit the global spatial context during bilinear pooling operations.
Contrarily to MCB, our approach preserves spatial context by directly
convolving the MD-sketch from the visual tensor features with the text vector
feature using higher order FFT. Furthermore we apply MCT incrementally at each
step of the question embedding and accumulate the multi-modal vectors with a
second LSTM layer before the final answer is chosen.

similar but more complicated proof for the Rubik's Cube case.

 <dc:description>  Natural language generation (NLG) is an important component in spoken
dialogue systems. This paper presents a model called Encoder-Aggregator-Decoder
which is an extension of an Recurrent Neural Network based Encoder-Decoder
architecture. The proposed Semantic Aggregator consists of two components: an
Aligner and a Refiner. The Aligner is a conventional attention calculated over
the encoded input information, while the Refiner is another attention or gating
mechanism stacked over the attentive Aligner in order to further select and
aggregate the semantic elements. The proposed model can be jointly trained both
sentence planning and surface realization to produce natural language
utterances. The model was extensively assessed on four different NLG domains,
in which the experimental results showed that the proposed generator
consistently outperforms the previous methods on all the NLG domains.

preferences, such feedback is scarce, which prompts the need for leveraging
more abundant implicit user feedback such as purchase record. Consequently,
recent studies focused on leveraging users' past purchase record to predict
their purchase. However, their performance is not satisfactory due to 1) the
lack of purchase history of users, and 2) more importantly the ill-posed
assumption of non-purchased items equally being considered as negative
feedback. In this paper, we define new pairwise relationships among items
aiming at overcoming the limitations of existing works, and propose a novel
method called P3S that stands for modeling pairwise relationships among three
disjoint item sets, which leverages users' click record in conjunction with
their purchase record. Precisely, we partition the items into three disjoint
sets based on users' purchase and click record, define new pairwise
relationships among them with respect to users, and reflect these relationships
into our pairwise learning-to-rank method. Experiments on two real-world
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
baselines in the task of predicting users' future purchase in e-commerce.

 <dc:description>  Trip hazards are a significant contributor to accidents on construction and
manufacturing sites, where over a third of Australian workplace injuries occur
[1]. Current safety inspections are labour intensive and limited by human
fallibility,making automation of trip hazard detection appealing from both a
safety and economic perspective. Trip hazards present an interesting challenge
to modern learning techniques because they are defined as much by affordance as
by object type; for example wires on a table are not a trip hazard, but can be
if lying on the ground. To address these challenges, we conduct a comprehensive
investigation into the performance characteristics of 11 different colour and
depth fusion approaches, including 4 fusion and one non fusion approach; using
colour and two types of depth images. Trained and tested on over 600 labelled
trip hazards over 4 floors and 2000m$\mathrm{^{2}}$ in an active construction
site,this approach was able to differentiate between identical objects in
different physical configurations (see Figure 1). Outperforming a colour-only
detector, our multi-modal trip detector fuses colour and depth information to
achieve a 4% absolute improvement in F1-score. These investigative results and
the extensive publicly available dataset moves us one step closer to assistive
or fully automated safety inspection systems on construction sites.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new unsupervised learning approach with stacked
autoencoder (SAE) for Arabic handwritten digits categorization. Recently,
Arabic handwritten digits recognition has been an important area due to its
applications in several fields. This work is focusing on the recognition part
of handwritten Arabic digits recognition that face several challenges,
including the unlimited variation in human handwriting and the large public
databases. Arabic digits contains ten numbers that were descended from the
Indian digits system. Stacked autoencoder (SAE) tested and trained the MADBase
database (Arabic handwritten digits images) that contain 10000 testing images
and 60000 training images. We show that the use of SAE leads to significant
improvements across different machine-learning classification algorithms. SAE
is giving an average accuracy of 98.5%.

 <dc:description>  Most risk analysis models systematically underestimate the probability and
impact of catastrophic events (e.g., economic crises, natural disasters, and
terrorism) by not taking into account interconnectivity and interdependence of
risks. To address this weakness, we propose the Cascading Alternating Renewal
Process (CARP) to forecast interconnected global risks. However, assessments of
the model's prediction precision are limited by lack of sufficient ground truth
data. Here, we establish prediction precision as a function of input data size
by using alternative long ground truth data generated by simulations of the
CARP model with known parameters. We illustrate the approach on a model of
fires in artificial cities assembled from basic city blocks with diverse
housing. The results confirm that parameter recovery variance exhibits power
law decay as a function of the length of available ground truth data. Using
CARP, we also demonstrate estimation using a disparate dataset that also has
dependencies: real-world prediction precision for the global risk model based
on the World Economic Forum Global Risk Report. We conclude that the CARP model
is an efficient method for predicting catastrophic cascading events with
potential applications to emerging local and global interconnected risks.

 <dc:description>  We consider a multi-pair massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay
network, where the relay is equipped with a large number, N, of antennas, but
driven by a far smaller number, L, of radio frequency (RF) chains. We assume
that K pairs of users are scheduled for simultaneous transmission, where K
satisfies 2K = L. A hybrid signal processing scheme is presented for both
uplink and downlink transmissions of the network. Analytical expressions of
both spectral and energy efficiency are derived with respect to the RF chain
number under imperfect channel estimation. It is revealed that, under the
condition N &gt; 4L^2/pi, the transmit power of each user and the relay can be
respectively scaled down by 1=sqrt(N) and 2K=sqrt(N) if pilot power scales with
signal power, or they can be respectively scaled down by 1=N and 2K=N if the
pilot power is kept fixed, while maintaining an asymptotically unchanged
spectral efficiency (SE). While regarding energy efficiency (EE) of the
network, the optimal EE is shown to be achieved when Pr = 2KPs, where Pr and Ps
respectively refer to the transmit power of the relay and each source terminal.
We show that the network EE is a quasi-concave function with respect to the
number of RF-chains which, therefore, admits a unique globally optimal choice
of the RF-chain number. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify our
observations.

port a system trained on one input language to another input language given
labeled training data for the first language and only unlabeled data for the
second language. In particular, we propose to use adversarial training of
neural networks to learn high-level features that are discriminative for the
main learning task, and at the same time are invariant across the input
languages. The evaluation results show sizable improvements for our
cross-language adversarial neural network (CLANN) model over a strong

 <dc:description>  The recently proposed open-source KAZE image feature detection and
description algorithm offers unprecedented performance in comparison to
conventional ones like SIFT and SURF as it relies on nonlinear scale spaces
instead of Gaussian linear scale spaces. The improved performance, however,
comes with a significant computational cost limiting its use for many
applications. We report a GPGPU implementation of the KAZE algorithm without
resorting to binary descriptors for gaining speedup. For a 1920 by 1200 sized
image our Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) C based GPU version took
around 300 milliseconds on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX Titan X (Maxwell
Architecture-GM200) card in comparison to nearly 2400 milliseconds for a
multithreaded CPU version (16 threaded Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650
processsor). The CUDA based parallel implementation is described in detail with
fine-grained comparison between the GPU and CPU implementations. By achieving
nearly 8 fold speedup without performance degradation our work expands the
applicability of the KAZE algorithm. Additionally, the strategies described
here can prove useful for the GPU implementation of other nonlinear scale space
based methods.

 <dc:description>  We give precise quantum resource estimates for Shor's algorithm to compute
discrete logarithms on elliptic curves over prime fields. The estimates are
derived from a simulation of a Toffoli gate network for controlled elliptic
curve point addition, implemented within the framework of the quantum computing
software tool suite LIQ$Ui|\rangle$. We determine circuit implementations for
reversible modular arithmetic, including modular addition, multiplication and
inversion, as well as reversible elliptic curve point addition. We conclude
that elliptic curve discrete logarithms on an elliptic curve defined over an
$n$-bit prime field can be computed on a quantum computer with at most $9n +
2\lceil\log_2(n)\rceil+10$ qubits using a quantum circuit of at most $448 n^3
\log_2(n) + 4090 n^3$ Toffoli gates. We are able to classically simulate the
Toffoli networks corresponding to the controlled elliptic curve point addition
as the core piece of Shor's algorithm for the NIST standard curves P-192,
P-224, P-256, P-384 and P-521. Our approach allows gate-level comparisons to
recent resource estimates for Shor's factoring algorithm. The results also
support estimates given earlier by Proos and Zalka and indicate that, for
current parameters at comparable classical security levels, the number of
qubits required to tackle elliptic curves is less than for attacking RSA,
suggesting that indeed ECC is an easier target than RSA.

 <dc:description>  We developed &quot;Comicolorization&quot;, a semi-automatic colorization system for
manga images. Given a monochrome manga and reference images as inputs, our
system generates a plausible color version of the manga. This is the first work
to address the colorization of an entire manga title (a set of manga pages).
Our method colorizes a whole page (not a single panel) semi-automatically, with
the same color for the same character across multiple panels. To colorize the
target character by the color from the reference image, we extract a color
feature from the reference and feed it to the colorization network to help the
colorization. Our approach employs adversarial loss to encourage the effect of
the color features. Optionally, our tool allows users to revise the
colorization result interactively. By feeding the color features to our deep
colorization network, we accomplish colorization of the entire manga using the
desired colors for each panel.

 <dc:description>  We analyze successive cancellation (SC) decoder by using two random
functions. The first function is related to the likelihoods of 0 and 1 in each
code position, while the second gives the difference between their posterior
probabilities. We then study the second power moments of both functions. We
show that these moments are being squared in channel transformations, while
their product tends to 0 for growing lengths $n$. This gives an elementary
proof of polarization properties of SC decoding. We also derive a simple
ordering of decoding channels with construction complexity of order $n\log n$.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD), which is the problem of learning
detectors using only image-level labels, has been attracting more and more
interest. However, this problem is quite challenging due to the lack of
location supervision. To address this issue, this paper integrates saliency
into a deep architecture, in which the location in- formation is explored both
explicitly and implicitly. Specifically, we select highly confident object pro-
posals under the guidance of class-specific saliency maps. The location
information, together with semantic and saliency information, of the selected
proposals are then used to explicitly supervise the network by imposing two
additional losses. Meanwhile, a saliency prediction sub-network is built in the
architecture. The prediction results are used to implicitly guide the
localization procedure. The entire network is trained end-to-end. Experiments
on PASCAL VOC demonstrate that our approach outperforms all state-of-the-arts.

 <dc:title>Variable-to-Fixed Length Homophonic Coding Suitable for Asymmetric

 <dc:creator>Honda, Junya</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In communication through asymmetric channels the capacity-achieving input
distribution is not uniform in general. Homophonic coding is a framework to
invertibly convert a (usually uniform) message into a sequence with some target
distribution, and is a promising candidate to generate codewords with the
nonuniform target distribution for asymmetric channels. In particular, a
Variable-to-Fixed length (VF) homophonic code can be used as a suitable
component for channel codes to avoid decoding error propagation. However, the
existing VF homophonic code requires the knowledge of the maximum relative gap
of probabilities between two adjacent sequences beforehand, which is an
unrealistic assumption for long block codes. In this paper we propose a new VF
homophonic code without such a requirement by allowing one-symbol decoding
delay. We evaluate this code theoretically and experimentally to verify its
asymptotic optimality.

 <dc:description>  The need for large annotated image datasets for training Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) has been a significant impediment for their adoption in
computer vision applications. We show that with transfer learning an effective
object detector can be trained almost entirely on synthetically rendered
datasets. We apply this strategy for detecting pack- aged food products
clustered in refrigerator scenes. Our CNN trained only with 4000 synthetic
images achieves mean average precision (mAP) of 24 on a test set with 55
distinct products as objects of interest and 17 distractor objects. A further
increase of 12% in the mAP is obtained by adding only 400 real images to these
4000 synthetic images in the training set. A high degree of photorealism in the
synthetic images was not essential in achieving this performance. We analyze
factors like training data set size and 3D model dictionary size for their
influence on detection performance. Additionally, training strategies like
fine-tuning with selected layers and early stopping which affect transfer
learning from synthetic scenes to real scenes are explored. Training CNNs with
synthetic datasets is a novel application of high-performance computing and a
promising approach for object detection applications in domains where there is
a dearth of large annotated image data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we try to solve the problem of temporal link prediction in
information networks. This implies predicting the time it takes for a link to
appear in the future, given its features that have been extracted at the
current network snapshot. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic
non-parametric approach, called &quot;Non-Parametric Generalized Linear Model&quot;
(NP-GLM), which infers the hidden underlying probability distribution of the
link advent time given its features. We then present a learning algorithm for
NP-GLM and an inference method to answer time-related queries. Extensive
experiments conducted on both synthetic data and real-world Sina Weibo social
network demonstrate the effectiveness of NP-GLM in solving temporal link
prediction problem vis-a-vis competitive baselines.

 <dc:title>GM-Net: Learning Features with More Efficiency</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are capable of learning
unprecedentedly effective features from images. Some researchers have struggled
to enhance the parameters' efficiency using grouped convolution. However, the
relation between the optimal number of convolutional groups and the recognition
performance remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a series of
Basic Units (BUs) and a two-level merging strategy to construct deep CNNs,
referred to as a joint Grouped Merging Net (GM-Net), which can produce joint
grouped and reused deep features while maintaining the feature discriminability
for classification tasks. Our GM-Net architectures with the proposed BU_A
(dense connection) and BU_B (straight mapping) lead to significant reduction in
the number of network parameters and obtain performance improvement in image
classification tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the
superior performance of the GM-Net than the state-of-the-arts on the benchmark
datasets, e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN.

 <dc:description>  Bug tracking tools are vital for managing bugs in any open source as well as
proprietary commercial projects. Considering the significance of using an
appropriate bug tracking tool, we assess the features offered by 31 open source
bug tracking tools and their significance of usage in open source projects. We
have categorized these tools into different classes based on their features. We
have also conducted a developer survey by working with open source software
practitioners to understand the effectiveness of these tools in their
day-to-day software development. We also explored StackOverFlow - a developer Q
&amp; A forum to understand the developer experiences and challenges while using
open source bug tracking tools. Our observations generated encouraging results
that can used as a recommendation guide for open source software community to
choose the best bug tracking tool based on their functional needs.
Additionally, we have identified few features that are needed but not offered
by most of these bug tracking tools.

 <dc:description>  JaTeCS is an open source Java library that supports research on automatic
text categorization and other related problems, such as ordinal regression and
quantification, which are of special interest in opinion mining applications.
It covers all the steps of an experimental activity, from reading the corpus to
the evaluation of the experimental results. As JaTeCS is focused on text as the
main input data, it provides the user with many text-dedicated tools, e.g.:
data readers for many formats, including the most commonly used text corpora
and lexical resources, natural language processing tools, multi-language
support, methods for feature selection and weighting, the implementation of
many machine learning algorithms as well as wrappers for well-known external
software (e.g., SVM_light) which enable their full control from code. JaTeCS
support its expansion by abstracting through interfaces many of the typical
tools and procedures used in text processing tasks. The library also provides a
number of &quot;template&quot; implementations of typical experimental setups (e.g.,
train-test, k-fold validation, grid-search optimization, randomized runs) which
enable fast realization of experiments just by connecting the templates with
data readers, learning algorithms and evaluation measures.

 <dc:description>  Knowing a biomolecule's structure is inherently linked to and a prerequisite
for any detailed understanding of its function. Significant effort has gone
into developing technologies for structural characterization. These
technologies do not directly provide 3D structures; instead they typically
yield noisy and erroneous distance information between specific entities such
as atoms or residues, which have to be translated into consistent 3D models.
  Here we present an approach for this translation process based on
maxent-stress optimization. Our new approach extends the original graph drawing
method for the new application's specifics by introducing additional
constraints and confidence values as well as algorithmic components. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach infers structural models (i. e.,
sensible 3D coordinates for the molecule's atoms) that correspond well to the
distance information, can handle noisy and error-prone data, and is
considerably faster than established tools. Our results promise to allow domain
scientists nearly-interactive structural modeling based on distance
constraints.

 <dc:title>Approximating Sparsest Cut in Low Rank Graphs via Embeddings from
  Approximately Low-Dimensional Spaces</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rabani, Yuval</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Venkat, Rakesh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of embedding a finite set of points $\{x_1, \ldots,
x_n\} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ that satisfy $\ell_2^2$ triangle inequalities into
$\ell_1$, when the points are approximately low-dimensional. Goemans
(unpublished, appears in a work of [Magen and Moharammi, 2008]) showed that
such points residing in \emph{exactly} $d$ dimensions can be embedded into
$\ell_1$ with distortion at most $\sqrt{d}$. We prove the following robust
analogue of this statement: if there exists a $r$-dimensional subspace $\Pi$
such that the projections onto this subspace satisfy $\sum_{i,j \in [n]}\Vert
\Pi x_i - \Pi x_j \Vert _2^2 \geq \Omega(1) \sum_{i,j \in [n]}\Vert x_i - x_j
\Vert _2^2$, then there is an embedding of the points into $\ell_1$ with
$O(\sqrt{r})$ average distortion. A consequence of this result is that the
integrality gap of the well-known Goemans-Linial SDP relaxation for the Uniform
Sparsest Cut problem is $O(\sqrt{r})$ on graphs $G$ whose $r$-th smallest
normalized eigenvalue of the Laplacian satisfies $\lambda_r(G)/n \geq
\Omega(1)\Phi_{SDP} (G)$. Our result improves upon the previously known bound
of $O(r)$ on the average distortion, and the integrality gap of the
Goemans-Linial SDP under the same preconditions, proven in the previous works
of [Deshpande and Venkat, 2014] and [Deshpande, Harsha and Venkat, 2016].

 <dc:description>  Low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) are considered to reduce cost and power consumption in
multiuser massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Using the Bussgang
theorem, we derive the asymptotic downlink achievable rate w.r.t the
resolutions of both DACs and ADCs, i.e., $b_{DA}$ and $b_{AD}$, under the
assumption of large antenna number, $N$, and fixed user load ratio, $\beta$. We
characterize the rate loss caused by finite-bit-resolution converters and
reveal that the quantization distortion is ignorable at low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) even with low-resolution converters at both sides. While for
maintaining the same rate loss at high SNR, it is discovered that one-more-bit
DAC resolution is needed when more users are scheduled with $\beta$ increased
by four times. More specifically for one-bit rate loss requirement, $b_{DA}$
can be set by $\left\lceil b_{AD}+\frac{1}{2}\log\beta \right\rceil$ given
$b_{AD}$. Similar observations on ADCs are also obtained with numerical
verifications.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Analytical Initialization Method for Spacecraft Attitude

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a dynamic analytical initialization method for spacecraft
attitude estimators. In the proposed method, the desired attitude matrix is
decomposed into two parts: one is the constant attitude matrix at the very
start and the other encodes the attitude changes of the body frame from its
initial state. The latter one can be calculated recursively using the gyroscope
outputs and the constant attitude matrix can be determined using constructed
vector observations at different time. Compared with traditional initialization
methods, the proposed method does not necessitate the spacecraft being static
or more than two non-collinear vector observations at the same time. Therefore,
the proposed method can promote increased spacecraft autonomy by autonomous
initialization of attitude estimators. The effectiveness and prospect of the
proposed method in spacecraft attitude estimation applications have been
validated through numerical simulations.

identify and implement realistic security solutions to prevent incidents from
occurring, the ability to initially identify a security incident is paramount
when researching a security incident lifecycle. Hence, this research
investigates the ability of employees in a Global Fortune 500 financial
organization, through internal electronic surveys, to recognize and report
security incidents to pursue a more holistic security posture. The research
contribution is an initial insight into security incident perceptions by

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of decomposing (clustering) a tree with respect to costs
attributed to pairs of nodes, so as to minimize the sum of costs for those
pairs of nodes that are in the same component (cluster). For the general case
and for the special case of the tree being a star, we show that the problem is
NP-hard. For the special case of the tree being a path, this problem is known
to be polynomial time solvable. We characterize several classes of facets of
the combinatorial polytope associated with a formulation of this clustering
problem in terms of lifted multicuts. In particular, our results yield a
complete totally dual integral (TDI) description of the lifted multicut
polytope for paths, which establishes a connection to the combinatorial
properties of alternative formulations such as set partitioning.

 <dc:title>Structure Learning in Motor Control:A Deep Reinforcement Learning Model</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Motor adaptation displays a structure-learning effect: adaptation to a new
perturbation occurs more quickly when the subject has prior exposure to
perturbations with related structure. Although this `learning-to-learn' effect
is well documented, its underlying computational mechanisms are poorly
understood. We present a new model of motor structure learning, approaching it
from the point of view of deep reinforcement learning. Previous work outside of
motor control has shown how recurrent neural networks can account for
learning-to-learn effects. We leverage this insight to address motor learning,
by importing it into the setting of model-based reinforcement learning. We
apply the resulting processing architecture to empirical findings from a
landmark study of structure learning in target-directed reaching (Braun et al.,
2009), and discuss its implications for a wider range of learning-to-learn
phenomena.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Extending TREC-style test collections by incorporating external resources is
a time consuming and challenging task. Making use of freely available web data
requires technical skills to work with APIs or to create a web scraping program
specifically tailored to the task at hand. We present a light-weight
alternative that employs the web data extraction language OXPath to harvest
data to be added to an existing test collection from web resources. We
demonstrate this by creating an extended version of GIRT4 called GIRT4-XT with
additional metadata fields harvested via OXPath from the social sciences portal
Sowiport. This allows the re-use of this collection for other evaluation
purposes like bibliometrics-enhanced retrieval. The demonstrated method can be
applied to a variety of similar scenarios and is not limited to extending
existing collections but can also be used to create completely new ones with
little effort.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the use of Machine Learning (ML) in medicine by focusing
on the main problem that this computational approach has been aimed at solving
or at least minimizing: uncertainty. To this aim, we point out how uncertainty
is so ingrained in medicine that it biases also the representation of clinical
phenomena, that is the very input of ML models, thus undermining the clinical
significance of their output. Recognizing this can motivate both medical
doctors, in taking more responsibility in the development and use of these
decision aids, and the researchers, in pursuing different ways to assess the
value of these systems. In so doing, both designers and users could take this
intrinsic characteristic of medicine more seriously and consider alternative
approaches that do not &quot;sweep uncertainty under the rug&quot; within an objectivist
fiction, which everyone can come up by believing as true.

 <dc:description>  Every channel can be expressed as a convex combination of deterministic
channels with each deterministic channel corresponding to one particular
intrinsic state. Such convex combinations are in general not unique, each
giving rise to a specific intrinsic-state distribution. In this paper we study
the maximum and the minimum capacities of a channel when the realization of its
intrinsic state is causally available at the encoder and/or the decoder.
Several conclusive results are obtained for binary-input channels and
binary-output channels. Byproducts of our investigation include a
generalization of the Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem and a condition on the
uselessness of causal state information at the encoder.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning is the state-of-the-art in fields such as visual object
recognition and speech recognition. This learning uses a large number of
layers, huge number of units, and connections. Therefore, overfitting is a
serious problem. To avoid this problem, dropout learning is proposed. Dropout
learning neglects some inputs and hidden units in the learning process with a
probability, p, and then, the neglected inputs and hidden units are combined
with the learned network to express the final output. We find that the process
of combining the neglected hidden units with the learned network can be
regarded as ensemble learning, so we analyze dropout learning from this point
of view.

 <dc:description>  We consider probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) as a means of increasing
the spectral efficiency of fiber-optic communication systems. In contrast to
previous works in the literature, we consider probabilistic shaping with hard
decision decoding (HDD). In particular, we apply the PAS recently introduced by
B\&quot;ocherer \emph{et al.} to a coded modulation (CM) scheme with bit-wise HDD
that uses a staircase code as the forward error correction code. We show that
the CM scheme with PAS and staircase codes yields significant gains in spectral
efficiency with respect to the baseline scheme using a staircase code and a
standard constellation with uniformly distributed signal points. Using a single
staircase code, the proposed scheme achieves performance within $0.57$--$1.44$
dB of the corresponding achievable information rate for a wide range of
spectral efficiencies.

 <dc:title>MEC: Memory-efficient Convolution for Deep Neural Network</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Convolution is a critical component in modern deep neural networks, thus
several algorithms for convolution have been developed. Direct convolution is
simple but suffers from poor performance. As an alternative, multiple indirect
methods have been proposed including im2col-based convolution, FFT-based
convolution, or Winograd-based algorithm. However, all these indirect methods
have high memory-overhead, which creates performance degradation and offers a
poor trade-off between performance and memory consumption. In this work, we
propose a memory-efficient convolution or MEC with compact lowering, which
reduces memory-overhead substantially and accelerates convolution process. MEC
lowers the input matrix in a simple yet efficient/compact way (i.e., much less
memory-overhead), and then executes multiple small matrix multiplications in
parallel to get convolution completed. Additionally, the reduced memory
footprint improves memory sub-system efficiency, improving performance. Our
experimental results show that MEC reduces memory consumption significantly
with good speedup on both mobile and server platforms, compared with other
indirect convolution algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Interval Markov decision processes (IMDPs) generalise classical MDPs by
having interval-valued transition probabilities. They provide a powerful
modelling tool for probabilistic systems with an additional variation or
uncertainty that prevents the knowledge of the exact transition probabilities.
In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-objective robust strategy
synthesis for interval MDPs, where the aim is to find a robust strategy that
guarantees the satisfaction of multiple properties at the same time in face of
the transition probability uncertainty. We first show that this problem is
PSPACE-hard. Then, we provide a value iteration-based decision algorithm to
approximate the Pareto set of achievable points. We finally demonstrate the
practical effectiveness of our proposed approaches by applying them on several
case studies using a prototypical tool.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we examine the performance of the decode-and-forward (DF)
relaying protocols with finite blocklength (FB). We provide the overall outage
probability of three distinct DF relaying protocols, where the channels are
assumed to be quasi static Rayleigh fading. More importantly, we derive the
closed form expressions of the outage probability in the three relaying
scenarios. We illustrate protocols where the cooperative communications
outperform the direct transmission (DT). In addition, we compare the operating
efficiency of the cooperative schemes in the ultra-reliable (UR) region.

 <dc:title>Stance Detection in Turkish Tweets</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Stance detection is a classification problem in natural language processing
where for a text and target pair, a class result from the set {Favor, Against,
Neither} is expected. It is similar to the sentiment analysis problem but
instead of the sentiment of the text author, the stance expressed for a
particular target is investigated in stance detection. In this paper, we
present a stance detection tweet data set for Turkish comprising stance
annotations of these tweets for two popular sports clubs as targets.
Additionally, we provide the evaluation results of SVM classifiers for each
target on this data set, where the classifiers use unigram, bigram, and hashtag
features. This study is significant as it presents one of the initial stance
detection data sets proposed so far and the first one for Turkish language, to
the best of our knowledge. The data set and the evaluation results of the
corresponding SVM-based approaches will form plausible baselines for the
comparison of future studies on stance detection.

 <dc:title>Effective Spoken Language Labeling with Deep Recurrent Neural Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Understanding spoken language is a highly complex problem, which can be
decomposed into several simpler tasks. In this paper, we focus on Spoken
Language Understanding (SLU), the module of spoken dialog systems responsible
for extracting a semantic interpretation from the user utterance. The task is
treated as a labeling problem. In the past, SLU has been performed with a wide
variety of probabilistic models. The rise of neural networks, in the last
couple of years, has opened new interesting research directions in this domain.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in particular are able not only to represent
several pieces of information as embeddings but also, thanks to their recurrent
architecture, to encode as embeddings relatively long contexts. Such long
contexts are in general out of reach for models previously used for SLU. In
this paper we propose novel RNNs architectures for SLU which outperform
previous ones. Starting from a published idea as base block, we design new deep
RNNs achieving state-of-the-art results on two widely used corpora for SLU:
ATIS (Air Traveling Information System), in English, and MEDIA (Hotel
information and reservation in France), in French.

 <dc:title>The Augmentation Property of Binary Matrices for the Binary and Boolean

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We define the Augmentation property for binary matrices with respect to
different rank functions. A matrix $A$ has the Augmentation property for a
given rank function, if for any subset of column vectors $x_1,...,x_t$ for for
which the rank of $A$ does not increase when augmented separately with each of
the vectors $x_i$, $1\leq i \leq t$, it also holds that the rank does not
increase when augmenting $A$ with all vectors $x_1,...,x_t$ simultaneously.
This property holds trivially for the usual linear rank over the reals, but as
we show, things change significantly when considering the binary and boolean
rank of a matrix.
  We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for this property to hold under
the binary and boolean rank of binary matrices. Namely, a matrix has the
Augmentation property for these rank functions if and only if it has a unique
base that spans all other bases of the matrix with respect to the given rank
function. For the binary rank, we also present a concrete characterization of a
family of matrices that has the Augmentation property. This characterization is
based on the possible types of linear dependencies between rows of $V$, in
optimal binary decompositions of the matrix as $A=U\cdot V$.
  Furthermore, we use the Augmentation property to construct simple families of
matrices, for which there is a gap between their real and binary rank and
between their real and boolean rank.

 <dc:description>  We propose a geo-encryption protocol that allow mobile nodes to communicate
securely by restricting the decryption of a message to a particular location
and time period. Our protocol will handle the exchange of movement parameters,
so that a sender is able to geo-encrypt messages to a moving decryption zone
that contains a mobile node's estimated location. We also present methods for
estimating the node's movement parameters to allow for geo-encryption. Finally,
we evaluate our model by measuring the induced overhead to the network and its
performance in terms of decryption ratio.

 <dc:description>  Common video representations often deploy an average or maximum pooling of
pre-extracted frame features over time. Such an approach provides a simple
means to encode feature distributions, but is likely to be suboptimal. As an
alternative, we here explore combinations of learnable pooling techniques such
as Soft Bag-of-words, Fisher Vectors, NetVLAD, GRU and LSTM to aggregate video
features over time. We also introduce a learnable non-linear network unit,
named Context Gating, aiming at modeling interdependencies between features. We
evaluate the method on the multi-modal Youtube-8M Large-Scale Video
Understanding dataset using pre-extracted visual and audio features. We
demonstrate improvements provided by the Context Gating as well as by the
combination of learnable pooling methods. We finally show how this leads to the
best performance, out of more than 600 teams, in the Kaggle Youtube-8M
Large-Scale Video Understanding challenge.

 <dc:title>Expert and Non-Expert Opinion about Technological Unemployment</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Walsh, Toby</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There is significant concern that technological advances, especially in
Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), could lead to high levels of
unemployment in the coming decades. Studies have estimated that around half of
all current jobs are at risk of automation. To look into this issue in more
depth, we surveyed experts in Robotics and AI about the risk, and compared
their views with those of non-experts. Whilst the experts predicted a
significant number of occupations were at risk of automation in the next two
decades, they were more cautious than people outside the field in predicting
occupations at risk. Their predictions were consistent with their estimates for
when computers might be expected to reach human level performance across a wide
range of skills. These estimates were typically decades later than those of the
non-experts. Technological barriers may therefore provide society with more
time to prepare for an automated future than the public fear. In addition,
public expectations may need to be dampened about the speed of progress to be
expected in Robotics and AI.

 <dc:description>  The practical limitations and challenges of radio frequency (RF) based
communication networks have become increasingly apparent over the past decade,
leading researchers to seek new hybrid communication approaches. One promising
strategy that has been the subject of considerable interest is the augmentation
of RF technology by Free Space Optics (FSO), using the strength of each
communication technology to overcome the limitations of the other. In this
article, we introduce a new scheme for controlling the topology in hybrid
Radio-Frequency/Free Space Optics (RF/FSO) wireless mesh networks. Our scheme
is based on adaptive adjustments to both transmission power (of RF and FSO
transmitters) and the optical beam-width (of FSO transmitters) at individual
nodes, with the objective of meeting specified Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements, specifically end-to-end delay and throughput. We show how one can
effectively encode the instantaneous objectives and constraints of the system
as an instance of Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We demonstrate that the
technique of Lagrangian Relaxation (LR), augmented with iterative repair
heuristics, can be used to determine good (albeit sub-optimal) solutions for
the ILP problem, making the approach feasible for mid-sized networks. We make
the proposed scheme viable for large-scale networks in terms of number of
nodes, number of transceivers, and number of source-destination pairs by
solving the ILP problem using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
implementation.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new image denoising method, tailored to specific
classes of images, assuming that a dataset of clean images of the same class is
available. Similarly to the non-local means (NLM) algorithm, the proposed
method computes a weighted average of non-local patches, which we interpret
under the importance sampling framework. This viewpoint introduces flexibility
regarding the adopted priors, the noise statistics, and the computation of
Bayesian estimates. The importance sampling viewpoint is exploited to
approximate the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) patch estimates, using the
true underlying prior on image patches. The estimates thus obtained converge to
the true MMSE estimates, as the number of samples approaches infinity.
Experimental results provide evidence that the proposed denoiser outperforms
the state-of-the-art in the specific classes of face and text images.

 <dc:description>  The Japanese comic format known as Manga is popular all over the world. It is
traditionally produced in black and white, and colorization is time consuming
and costly. Automatic colorization methods generally rely on greyscale values,
which are not present in manga. Furthermore, due to copyright protection,
colorized manga available for training is scarce. We propose a manga
colorization method based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
(cGAN). Unlike previous cGAN approaches that use many hundreds or thousands of
training images, our method requires only a single colorized reference image
for training, avoiding the need of a large dataset. Colorizing manga using
cGANs can produce blurry results with artifacts, and the resolution is limited.
We therefore also propose a method of segmentation and color-correction to
mitigate these issues. The final results are sharp, clear, and in high
resolution, and stay true to the character's original color scheme.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new genetic algorithm with optimal recombination for the
asymmetric instances of travelling salesman problem. The algorithm incorporates
several new features that contribute to its effectiveness: (i) Optimal
recombination problem is solved within crossover operator. (ii) A new mutation
operator performs a random jump within 3-opt or 4-opt neighborhood. (iii)
Greedy constructive heuristic of W.Zhang and 3-opt local search heuristic are
used to generate the initial population. A computational experiment on TSPLIB
instances shows that the proposed algorithm yields competitive results to other
well-known memetic algorithms for asymmetric travelling salesman problem.

 <dc:description>  We propose Roadside Unit (RSU) Clouds as a novel way to offer non-safety
application with QoS for VANETs. The architecture of RSU Clouds is delineated,
and consists of traditional RSUs and specialized micro-datacenters and virtual
machines (VMs) using Software Defined Networking (SDN). SDN offers the
flexibility to migrate or replicate virtual services and reconfigure the data
forwarding rules dynamically. However, frequent changes to service hosts and
data flows not only result in degradation of services, but are also costly for
service providers. In this paper, we use Mininet to analyze and formally
quantify the reconfiguration overhead. Our unique RSU Cloud Resource Management
(CRM) model jointly minimizes reconfiguration overhead, cost of service
deployment and infrastructure routing delay. To the best of our knowledge, we
are the first to utilize this approach. We compare the performance of purist
approach to our Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model and our innovative
heuristic for the CRM technique and discuss the results. We will show the
benefits of a holistic approach in Cloud Resource Management with SDN.

 <dc:description>  We consider the online vector packing problem in which we have a $d$
dimensional knapsack and items $u$ with weight vectors $\mathbf{w}_u \in
\mathbb{R}_+^d$ arrive online in an arbitrary order. Upon the arrival of an
item, the algorithm must decide immediately whether to discard or accept the
item into the knapsack. When item $u$ is accepted, $\mathbf{w}_u(i)$ units of
capacity on dimension $i$ will be taken up, for each $i\in[d]$. To satisfy the
knapsack constraint, an accepted item can be later disposed of with no cost,
but discarded or disposed of items cannot be recovered. The objective is to
maximize the utility of the accepted items $S$ at the end of the algorithm,
which is given by $f(S)$ for some non-negative monotone submodular function
$f$.
  For any small constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we consider the special case that the
weight of an item on every dimension is at most a $(1-\epsilon)$ fraction of
the total capacity, and give a polynomial-time deterministic
$O(\frac{k}{\epsilon^2})$-competitive algorithm for the problem, where $k$ is
the (column) sparsity of the weight vectors. We also show several (almost)
tight hardness results even when the algorithm is computationally unbounded. We
show that under the $\epsilon$-slack assumption, no deterministic algorithm can
obtain any $o(k)$ competitive ratio, and no randomized algorithm can obtain any
$o(\frac{k}{\log k})$ competitive ratio. For the general case (when $\epsilon =
0$), no randomized algorithm can obtain any $o(k)$ competitive ratio.
  In contrast to the $(1+\delta)$ competitive ratio achieved in Kesselheim et
al. (STOC 2014) for the problem with random arrival order of items and under
large capacity assumption, we show that in the arbitrary arrival order case,
even when $\| \mathbf{w}_u \|_\infty$ is arbitrarily small for all items $u$,
it is impossible to achieve any $o(\frac{\log k}{\log\log k})$ competitive
ratio.

 <dc:description>  This work proposes a novel approach to restricting the access for blacklisted
Android system API calls. Main feature of the suggested method introduced in
this paper is that it requires only rootless or (user-mode) access to the
system unlike previous works. For that reason this method is valuable for
end-users due to the possibility of project distribution via Play Market and it
does not require any phone system modifications and/or updates. This paper
explains the required background of Android OS necessary for understanding and
describes the method for modification Android application. In this paper the
proof-of-concept implementation. That is able to block the application's IMEI
requests is introduced. Also this paper lists unsuccessful methods that tried
to provide the user security. Obviously with those restrictions application may
lack some of features that can only be granted in unsecured environment.

 <dc:description>  Planning in robotics is often split into task and motion planning. The
high-level, symbolic task planner decides what needs to be done, while the
motion planner checks feasibility and fills up geometric detail. It is known
however that such a decomposition is not effective in general as the symbolic
and geometrical components are not independent. In this work, we show that it
is possible to compile task and motion planning problems into classical AI
planning problems; i.e., planning problems over finite and discrete state
spaces with a known initial state, deterministic actions, and goal states to be
reached. The compilation is sound, meaning that classical plans are valid robot
plans, and probabilistically complete, meaning that valid robot plans are
classical plans when a sufficient number of configurations is sampled. In this
approach, motion planners and collision checkers are used for the compilation,
but not at planning time. The key elements that make the approach effective are
1) expressive classical AI planning languages for representing the compiled
problems in compact form, that unlike PDDL make use of functions and state
constraints, and 2) general width-based search algorithms capable of finding
plans over huge combinatorial spaces using weak heuristics only. Empirical
results are presented for a PR2 robot manipulating tens of objects, for which
long plans are required.

 <dc:description>  Evolutionary graph theory studies the evolutionary dynamics in a population
structure given as a connected graph. Each node of the graph represents an
individual of the population, and edges determine how offspring are placed. We
consider the classical birth-death Moran process where there are two types of
individuals, namely, the residents with fitness 1 and mutants with fitness r.
The fitness indicates the reproductive strength. The evolutionary dynamics
happens as follows: in the initial step, in a population of all resident
individuals a mutant is introduced, and then at each step, an individual is
chosen proportional to the fitness of its type to reproduce, and the offspring
replaces a neighbor uniformly at random. The process stops when all individuals
are either residents or mutants. The probability that all individuals in the
end are mutants is called the fixation probability. We present faster
polynomial-time Monte-Carlo algorithms for finidng the fixation probability on
undirected graphs. Our algorithms are always at least a factor O(n^2/log n)
faster as compared to the previous algorithms, where n is the number of nodes,
and is polynomial even if r is given in binary. We also present lower bounds
showing that the upper bound on the expected number of effective steps we

 <dc:description>  In the standard web browser programming model, third-party scripts included
in an application execute with the same privilege as the application's own
code. This leaves the application's confidential data vulnerable to theft and
leakage by malicious code and inadvertent bugs in the third-party scripts.
Security mechanisms in modern browsers (the same-origin policy, cross-origin
resource sharing and content security policies) are too coarse to suit this
programming model. All these mechanisms (and their extensions) describe whether
or not a script can access certain data, whereas the meaningful requirement is
to allow untrusted scripts access to confidential data that they need and to
prevent the scripts from leaking data on the side. Motivated by this gap, we
propose WebPol, a policy mechanism that allows a website developer to include
fine-grained policies on confidential application data in the familiar syntax
of the JavaScript programming language. The policies can be associated with any
webpage element, and specify what aspects of the element can be accessed by
which third-party domains. A script can access data that the policy allows it
to, but it cannot pass the data (or data derived from it) to other scripts or
remote hosts in contravention of the policy. To specify the policies, we expose
a small set of new native APIs in JavaScript. Our policies can be enforced
using any of the numerous existing proposals for information flow tracking in
web browsers. We have integrated our policies into one such proposal that we
use to evaluate performance overheads and to test our examples.

 <dc:description>  Network coverage is one of the fundamental requirements of any business of a
service provider. Mobile operators are expected to deploy base stations in an
effective way in order to cover most of the residential areas of a particular
country. Improved network coverage leads to increase total revenue, provide end
users with enhanced Quality of Services QoS anytime anywhere, and play vital
role in the development of telecom sector. In this paper, we measure and
statistically analyze network coverage of mobile operators in Afghanistan. Our
study is based on primary data collected on random basis from 1,515 mobile
phone users of cellular operators. The relationship between No Network Coverage
in some residential areas and Satisfaction of Mobile Phone Users is also
investigated. We furthermore propose realistic, feasible and cost-efficient
solutions to mobile operators and policy makers in order to expand network
coverage to non-covered residential areas as well as enhance the performance of
networks in existing covered areas of the country.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study adaptive and non-adaptive exact learning of Juntas
from membership queries. We use new techniques to find new bounds, narrow some
of the gaps between the lower bounds and upper bounds and find new
deterministic and randomized algorithms with small query and time complexities.
  Some of the bounds are tight in the sense that finding better ones either
gives a breakthrough result in some long-standing combinatorial open problem or
needs a new technique that is beyond the existing ones.

 <dc:description>  There is much interest in integrating millimeter wave radios (mmWave) into
wireless LANs and 5G cellular networks to benefit from their multiple GHz of
available spectrum. Yet unlike existing technologies, e.g., WiFi, mmWave radios
require highly directional antennas. Since the antennas have pencil-beams, the
transmitter and receiver need to align their antenna beams before they can
communicate. Existing solutions scan the entire space to find the best
alignment. Such a process has been shown to introduce up to seconds of delay,
and is unsuitable for wireless networks where an access point has to quickly
switch between users and accommodate mobile clients.
  This paper presents Rapid-Link, a new protocol that can find the best mmWave
beam alignment without scanning the space. Given all possible directions for
setting the antenna beam, Rapid-Link provably finds the optimal direction in
logarithmic number of measurements. Further, Rapid-Link works within the
existing 802.11ad standard for mmWave LAN, and can support both clients and
access points. We have implemented Rapid-Link in a mmWave radio and evaluated
it empirically. Our results show that it reduces beam alignment delay by orders
of magnitude. In particular, for highly directional mmWave devices operating
under 802.11ad, the delay drops from over a second to 2.5 ms.

 <dc:description>  Percolation based graph matching algorithms rely on the availability of seed
vertex pairs as side information to efficiently match users across networks.
Although such algorithms work well in practice, there are other types of side
information available which are potentially useful to an attacker. In this
paper, we consider the problem of matching two correlated graphs when an
attacker has access to side information, either in the form of community labels
or an imperfect initial matching. In the former case, we propose a naive graph
matching algorithm by introducing the community degree vectors which harness
the information from community labels in an efficient manner. Furthermore, we
analyze a variant of the basic percolation algorithm proposed in literature for
graphs with community structure. In the latter case, we propose a novel
percolation algorithm with two thresholds which uses an imperfect matching as
input to match correlated graphs.
  We evaluate the proposed algorithms on synthetic as well as real world
datasets using various experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the
importance of communities as side information especially when the number of
seeds is small and the networks are weakly correlated.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of placing a set $T$ of broadcast towers in a simple
polygon $P$ in order for any point to locate itself in the interior of $P$. Let
$V(p)$ denote the visibility polygon of a point $p$, as the set of all points
$q \in P$ that are visible to $p$. For any point $p \in P$: for each tower $t
\in T \cap V(p)$ the point $p$ receives the coordinates of $t$ and the
Euclidean distance between $t$ and $p$. From this information $p$ can determine
its coordinates. We show a tower-positioning algorithm that computes such a set
$T$ of size at most $\lfloor 2n/3\rfloor$, where $n$ is the size of $P$. This
improves the previous upper bound of $\lfloor 8n/9\rfloor$ towers. We also show
that $\lfloor 2n/3\rfloor$ towers are sometimes necessary.

 <dc:description>  Range Minimum Query (RMQ) is an important building brick of many compressed
data structures and string matching algorithms. Although this problem is
essentially solved in theory, with sophisticated data structures allowing for
constant time queries, there are scenarios in which the number of queries, $q$,
is rather small and given beforehand, which encourages to use a simpler
approach. A recent work by Alzamel et al. starts with contracting the input
array to a much shorter one, with its size proportional to $q$. In this work,
we build upon their solution, speeding up handling small batches of queries by
a factor of 3.8--7.8 (the gap grows with $q$). The key idea that helped us
achieve this advantage is adapting the well-known Sparse Table technique to
work on blocks, with speculative block minima comparisons. We also propose an
even much faster (but possibly using more space) variant without the array
contraction.

 <dc:description>  Graph representations offer powerful and intuitive ways to describe data in a
multitude of application domains. Here, we consider stochastic processes
generating graphs and propose a methodology for detecting changes in
stationarity of such processes. The methodology is general and considers a
process generating attributed graphs with a variable number of vertices/edges,
without the need to assume one-to-one correspondence between vertices at
different time steps. The methodology acts by embedding every graph of the
stream into a vector domain, where a conventional multivariate change detection
procedure can be easily applied. We ground the soundness of our proposal by
proving several theoretical results. In addition, we provide a specific
implementation of the methodology and evaluate its effectiveness on several
detection problems involving attributed graphs representing biological
molecules and drawings. Experimental results are contrasted with respect to
suitable baseline methods, demonstrating the competitiveness of our approach.

 <dc:description>  A profile describes a set of properties, e.g. a set of skills a person may
have, a set of skills required for a particular job, or a set of abilities a
football player may have with respect to a particular team strategy. Profile
matching aims to determine how well a given profile fits to a requested
profile. The approach taken in this article is grounded in a matching theory
that uses filters in lattices to represent profiles, and matching values in the
interval [0,1]: the higher the matching value the better is the fit. Such
lattices can be derived from knowledge bases exploiting description logics to
represent the knowledge about profiles. An interesting first question is, how
human expertise concerning the matching can be exploited to obtain most
accurate matchings. It will be shown that if a set of filters together with
matching values by some human expert is given, then under some mild
plausibility assumptions a matching measure can be determined such that the
computed matching values preserve the rankings given by the expert. A second
question concerns the efficient querying of databases of profile instances. For
matching queries that result in a ranked list of profile instances matching a
given one it will be shown how corresponding top-k queries can be evaluated on
grounds of pre-computed matching values, which in turn allows the maintenance
of the knowledge base to be decoupled from the maintenance of profile
instances. In addition, it will be shown how the matching queries can be
exploited for gap queries that determine how profile instances need to be
extended in order to improve in the rankings. Finally, the theory of matching
will be extended beyond the filters, which lead to a matching theory that
exploits fuzzy sets or probabilistic logic with maximum entropy semantics. It
will be shown that added fuzzy links can be captured by extending the
underlying lattice.

 <dc:title>Ensemble Framework for Real-time Decision Making</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rodgers, Philip</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Levine, John</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new framework for real-time decision making in video
games. An Ensemble agent is a compound agent composed of multiple agents, each
with its own tasks or goals to achieve. Usually when dealing with real-time
decision making, reactive agents are used; that is agents that return a
decision based on the current state. While reactive agents are very fast, most
games require more than just a rule-based agent to achieve good results.
Deliberative agents---agents that use a forward model to search future
states---are very useful in games with no hard time limit, such as Go or
Backgammon, but generally take too long for real-time games. The Ensemble
framework addresses this issue by allowing the agent to be both deliberative
and reactive at the same time. This is achieved by breaking up the game-play
into logical roles and having highly focused components for each role, with
each component disregarding anything outwith its own role. Reactive agents can
be used where a reactive agent is suited to the role, and where a deliberative
approach is required, branching is kept to a minimum by the removal of all
extraneous factors, enabling an informed decision to be made within a much
smaller time-frame. An Arbiter is used to combine the component results,
allowing high performing agents to be created from simple, efficient
components.

 <dc:description>  Node-perturbation learning is a type of statistical gradient descent
algorithm that can be applied to problems where the objective function is not
explicitly formulated, including reinforcement learning. It estimates the
gradient of an objective function by using the change in the object function in
response to the perturbation. The value of the objective function for an
unperturbed output is called a baseline. Cho et al. proposed node-perturbation
learning with a noisy baseline. In this paper, we report on building the
statistical mechanics of Cho's model and on deriving coupled differential
equations of order parameters that depict learning dynamics. We also show how
to derive the generalization error by solving the differential equations of
order parameters. On the basis of the results, we show that Cho's results are
also apply in general cases and show some general performances of Cho's model.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we present Web-STAR, an online platform for story understanding
built on top of the STAR (STory comprehension through ARgumentation) reasoning
engine. This platform includes a web-based IDE, integration with the STAR
system and a web service infrastructure to support integration with other
systems that rely on story understanding functionality to complete their tasks.
The platform also delivers a number of &quot;social&quot; features like public story
sharing with a built-in commenting system, a public repository for sharing
stories with the community and collaboration tools that can be used from both
project team members for development and educators for teaching. Moreover, we
discuss the ongoing work on adding new features and functionality to this
platform.

 <dc:description>  Bob has a black box that emits a single pure state qudit which is, from his
perspective, uniformly distributed. Alice wishes to give Bob evidence that she
has knowledge about the emitted state while giving him little or no information
about it. We show that zero-knowledge evidencing of such knowledge is
impossible in quantum relativistic protocols, extending a previous result of
Horodecki et al.. We also show that no such protocol can be both sound and
complete. We present a new quantum relativistic protocol which we conjecture to
be close to optimal in security against Alice and which reveals little
knowledge to Bob, for large dimension $d$. We analyse its security against
general attacks by Bob and restricted attacks by Alice.

 <dc:description>  Contact processes form a large and highly interesting class of dynamic
processes on networks, including epidemic and information spreading. While
devising stochastic models of such processes is relatively easy, analyzing them
is very challenging from a computational point of view, particularly for large
networks appearing in real applications. One strategy to reduce the complexity
of their analysis is to rely on approximations, often in terms of a set of
differential equations capturing the evolution of a random node, distinguishing
nodes with different topological contexts (i.e., different degrees of different
neighborhoods), like degree-based mean field (DBMF), approximate master
equation (AME), or pair approximation (PA). The number of differential
equations so obtained is typically proportional to the maximum degree kmax of
the network, which is much smaller than the size of the master equation of the
underlying stochastic model, yet numerically solving these equations can still
be problematic for large kmax. In this paper, we extend AME and PA, which has
been proposed only for the binary state case, to a multi-state setting and
provide an aggregation procedure that clusters together nodes having similar
degrees, treating those in the same cluster as indistinguishable, thus reducing
the number of equations while preserving an accurate description of global
observables of interest. We also provide an automatic way to build such
equations and to identify a small number of degree clusters that give accurate
results. The method is tested on several case studies, where it shows a high
level of compression and a reduction of computational time of several orders of
magnitude for large networks, with minimal loss in accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Human visual object recognition is typically rapid and seemingly effortless,
as well as largely independent of viewpoint and object orientation. Until very
recently, animate visual systems were the only ones capable of this remarkable
computational feat. This has changed with the rise of a class of computer
vision algorithms called deep neural networks (DNNs) that achieve human-level
classification performance on object recognition tasks. Furthermore, a growing
number of studies report similarities in the way DNNs and the human visual
system process objects, suggesting that current DNNs may be good models of
human visual object recognition. Yet there clearly exist important
architectural and processing differences between state-of-the-art DNNs and the
primate visual system. The potential behavioural consequences of these
differences are not well understood. We aim to address this issue by comparing
human and DNN generalisation abilities towards image degradations. We find the
human visual system to be more robust to image manipulations like contrast
reduction, additive noise or novel eidolon-distortions. In addition, we find
progressively diverging classification error-patterns between man and DNNs when
the signal gets weaker, indicating that there may still be marked differences
in the way humans and current DNNs perform visual object recognition. We
envision that our findings as well as our carefully measured and freely
available behavioural datasets provide a new useful benchmark for the computer
vision community to improve the robustness of DNNs and a motivation for
neuroscientists to search for mechanisms in the brain that could facilitate
this robustness.

 <dc:description>  Demand Side Management (DSM) strategies are of-ten associated with the
objectives of smoothing the load curve and reducing peak load. Although the
future of demand side manage-ment is technically dependent on remote and
automatic control of residential loads, the end-users play a significant role
by shifting the use of appliances to the off-peak hours when they are exposed
to Day-ahead market price. This paper proposes an optimum so-lution to the
problem of scheduling of household demand side management in the presence of PV
generation under a set of tech-nical constraints such as dynamic electricity
pricing and voltage deviation. The proposed solution is implemented based on
the Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA). This solution is evaluated through a set
of scenarios and simulation results show that the proposed approach results in
the reduction of electricity bills and the import of energy from the grid.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional sparse coding (CSC) improves sparse coding by learning a
shift-invariant dictionary from the data. However, existing CSC algorithms
operate in the batch mode and are expensive, in terms of both space and time,
on large datasets. In this paper, we alleviate these problems by using online
learning. The key is a reformulation of the CSC objective so that convolution
can be handled easily in the frequency domain and much smaller history matrices
are needed. We use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to
solve the resulting optimization problem and the ADMM subproblems have
efficient closed-form solutions. Theoretical analysis shows that the learned
dictionary converges to a stationary point of the optimization problem.
Extensive experiments show that convergence of the proposed method is much
faster and its reconstruction performance is also better. Moreover, while
existing CSC algorithms can only run on a small number of images, the proposed
method can handle at least ten times more images.

 <dc:description>  When we test a theory using data, it is common to focus on correctness: do
the predictions of the theory match what we see in the data? But we also care
about completeness: how much of the predictable variation in the data is
captured by the theory? This question is difficult to answer, because in
general we do not know how much &quot;predictable variation&quot; there is in the
problem. In this paper, we consider approaches motivated by machine learning
algorithms as a means of constructing a benchmark for the best attainable level
of prediction.
  We illustrate our methods on the task of predicting human-generated random
sequences. Relative to an atheoretical machine learning algorithm benchmark, we
find that existing behavioral models explain roughly 15 percent of the
predictable variation in this problem. This fraction is robust across several
variations on the problem. We also consider a version of this approach for
analyzing field data from domains in which human perception and generation of
randomness has been used as a conceptual framework; these include sequential
decision-making and repeated zero-sum games. In these domains, our framework
for testing the completeness of theories provides a way of assessing their
effectiveness over different contexts; we find that despite some differences,
the existing theories are fairly stable across our field domains in their
performance relative to the benchmark. Overall, our results indicate that (i)
there is a significant amount of structure in this problem that existing models
have yet to capture and (ii) there are rich domains in which machine learning
may provide a viable approach to testing completeness.

 <dc:description>  To better extract users' interest by exploiting the rich historical behavior
data is crucial for building the click-through rate (CTR) prediction model in
the online advertising system in e-commerce industry. There are two key
observations on user behavior data: i) \textbf{diversity}. Users are interested
in different kinds of goods when visiting e-commerce site. ii) \textbf{local
activation}. Whether users click or not click a good depends only on part of
their related historical behavior. However, most traditional CTR models lack of
capturing these structures of behavior data. In this paper, we introduce a new
proposed model, Deep Interest Network (DIN), which is developed and deployed in
the display advertising system in Alibaba. DIN represents users' diverse
interests with an interest distribution and designs an attention-like network
structure to locally activate the related interests according to the candidate
ad, which is proven to be effective and significantly outperforms traditional
model. Overfitting problem is easy to encounter on training such industrial
deep network with large scale sparse inputs. We study this problem carefully
and propose a useful adaptive regularization technique.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a two-stream model for dynamic texture synthesis. Our model is
based on pre-trained convolutional networks (ConvNets) that target two
independent tasks: (i) object recognition, and (ii) optical flow prediction.
Given an input dynamic texture, statistics of filter responses from the object
recognition ConvNet encapsulate the per-frame appearance of the input texture,
while statistics of filter responses from the optical flow ConvNet model its
dynamics. To generate a novel texture, a noise input sequence is optimized to
simultaneously match the feature statistics from each stream of an example
texture. Inspired by recent work on image style transfer and enabled by the
two-stream model, we also apply the synthesis approach to combine the texture
appearance from one texture with the dynamics of another to generate entirely
novel dynamic textures. We show that our approach generates novel, high quality
samples that match both the framewise appearance and temporal evolution of
input texture imagery. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate our approach with a
thorough user study.

 <dc:description>  Conversations with non-player characters (NPCs) in games are typically
confined to dialogue between a human player and a virtual agent, where the
conversation is initiated and controlled by the player. To create richer, more
believable environments for players, we need conversational behavior to reflect
initiative on the part of the NPCs, including conversations that include
multiple NPCs who interact with one another as well as the player. We describe
a generative computational model of group conversation between agents, an
abstract simulation of discussion in a small group setting. We define
conversational interactions in terms of rules for turn taking and interruption,
as well as belief change, sentiment change, and emotional response, all of
which are dependent on agent personality, context, and relationships. We
evaluate our model using a parameterized expressive range analysis, observing
correlations between simulation parameters and features of the resulting
conversations. This analysis confirms, for example, that character
personalities will predict how often they speak, and that heterogeneous groups
of characters will generate more belief change.

 <dc:description>  Information forms the basis for all human behavior, including the ubiquitous
decision-making that people constantly perform in their every day lives. It is
thus the mission of researchers to understand how humans process information to
reach decisions. In order to facilitate this task, this work proposes a novel
method of studying the reception of granular expressions in natural language.
The approach utilizes LASSO regularization as a statistical tool to extract
decisive words from textual content and draw statistical inferences based on
the correspondence between the occurrences of words and an exogenous response
variable. Accordingly, the method immediately suggests significant implications
for social sciences and Information Systems research: everyone can now identify
text segments and word choices that are statistically relevant to authors or
readers and, based on this knowledge, test hypotheses from behavioral research.
We demonstrate the contribution of our method by examining how authors
communicate subjective information through narrative materials. This allows us
to answer the question of which words to choose when communicating negative
information. On the other hand, we show that investors trade not only upon
facts in financial disclosures but are distracted by filler words and
non-informative language. Practitioners - for example those in the fields of
investor communications or marketing - can exploit our insights to enhance
their writings based on the true perception of word choice.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, on one hand, a class of linear codes with one or two weights
is obtained. Based on these linear codes, we construct two classes of constant
composition codes, which includes optimal constant composition codes depending
on LVFC bound. On the other hand, a class of constant composition codes is
derived from known linear codes.

 <dc:title>Secret Sharing and Shared Information</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Secret sharing is a cryptographic discipline in which the goal is to
distribute information about a secret over a set of participants in such a way
that only specific authorized combinations of participants together can
reconstruct the secret. Thus, secret sharing schemes are systems of variables
in which it is very clearly specified which subsets have information about the
secret. As such, they provide perfect model systems for information
decompositions. However, following this intuition too far leads to an
information decomposition with negative partial information terms, which are
difficult to interpret. One possible explanation is that the partial
information lattice proposed by Williams and Beer is incomplete and has to be
extended to incorporate terms corresponding to higher order redundancy. These
results put bounds on information decompositions that follow the partial
information framework, and they hint at where the partial information lattice
needs to be improved.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: 9 pages, 1 figure. The material was presented at a Workshop on
  information decompositions at FIAS, Frankfurt, in 12/2016. The revision
  includes changes in the definition of combinations of secret sharing schemes.
  Section 3 and Appendix now discusses in how far existing measures satisfy the
  proposed properties. The concluding section is considerably revised</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  Objective: Surgical data science is evolving into a research field that aims
to observe everything occurring within and around the treatment process to
provide situation-aware data-driven assistance. In the context of endoscopic
video analysis, the accurate classification of organs in the field of view of
the camera proffers a technical challenge. Herein, we propose a new approach to
anatomical structure classification and image tagging that features an
intrinsic measure of confidence to estimate its own performance with high
reliability and which can be applied to both RGB and multispectral imaging (MI)
data. Methods: Organ recognition is performed using a superpixel classification
strategy based on textural and reflectance information. Classification
confidence is estimated by analyzing the dispersion of class probabilities.
Assessment of the proposed technology is performed through a comprehensive in
vivo study with seven pigs. Results: When applied to image tagging, mean
accuracy in our experiments increased from 65% (RGB) and 80% (MI) to 90% (RGB)
and 96% (MI) with the confidence measure. Conclusion: Results showed that the
confidence measure had a significant influence on the classification accuracy,
and MI data are better suited for anatomical structure labeling than RGB data.
Significance: This work significantly enhances the state of art in automatic
labeling of endoscopic videos by introducing the use of the confidence metric,
and by being the first study to use MI data for in vivo laparoscopic tissue
classification. The data of our experiments will be released as the first in
vivo MI dataset upon publication of this paper.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies a new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless power
transfer (WPT) system, where a UAV-mounted energy transmitter (ET) broadcasts
wireless energy to charge distributed energy receivers (ERs) on the ground. In
particular, we consider a basic two-user scenario, and investigate how the UAV
can optimally exploit its mobility to maximize the amount of energy transferred
to the two ERs during a given charging period. We characterize the achievable
energy region of the two ERs, by optimizing the UAV's trajectory subject to a
maximum speed constraint. We show that when the distance between the two ERs is
smaller than a certain threshold, the boundary of the energy region is achieved
when the UAV hovers above a fixed location between them for all time; while
when their distance is larger than the threshold, to achieve the boundary of
the energy region, the UAV in general needs to hover and fly between two
different locations above the line connecting them. Numerical results show that
the optimized UAV trajectory can significantly improve the WPT efficiency and
fairness of the two ERs, especially when the UAV's maximum speed is large
and/or the charging duration is long.

 <dc:title>The Capacity of Cache Aided Private Information Retrieval</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The problem of cache enabled private information retrieval (PIR) is
considered in which a user wishes to privately retrieve one out of $K$
messages, each of size $L$ bits from $N$ distributed databases. The user has a
local cache of storage $SL$ bits which can be used to store any function of the
$K$ messages. The main contribution of this work is the exact characterization
of the capacity of cache aided PIR as a function of the storage parameter $S$.
In particular, for a given cache storage parameter $S$, the
information-theoretically optimal download cost $D^{*}(S)/L$ (or the inverse of
capacity) is shown to be equal to $(1- \frac{S}{K})\left(1+ \frac{1}{N}+ \ldots
+ \frac{1}{N^{K-1}}\right)$. Special cases of this result correspond to the
settings when $S=0$, for which the optimal download cost was shown by Sun and
Jafar to be $\left(1+ \frac{1}{N}+ \ldots + \frac{1}{N^{K-1}}\right)$, and the
case when $S=K$, i.e., cache size is large enough to store all messages
locally, for which the optimal download cost is $0$. The intermediate points
$S\in (0, K)$ can be readily achieved through a simple memory-sharing based PIR
scheme. The key technical contribution of this work is the converse, i.e., a
lower bound on the download cost as a function of storage $S$ which shows that
memory sharing is information-theoretically optimal.

 <dc:description>  Conventional methods of 3D object generative modeling learn volumetric
predictions using deep networks with 3D convolutional operations, which are
direct analogies to classical 2D ones. However, these methods are
computationally wasteful in attempt to predict 3D shapes, where information is
rich only on the surfaces. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D generative
modeling framework to efficiently generate object shapes in the form of dense
point clouds. We use 2D convolutional operations to predict the 3D structure
from multiple viewpoints and jointly apply geometric reasoning with 2D
projection optimization. We introduce the pseudo-renderer, a differentiable
module to approximate the true rendering operation, to synthesize novel depth
maps for optimization. Experimental results for single-image 3D object
reconstruction tasks show that we outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of shape similarity and prediction density.

 <dc:description>  The significant optical and size benefits of using a curved focal surface for
imaging systems have been well studied yet never brought to market for lack of
a high-quality, mass-producible, curved image sensor. In this work we
demonstrate that commercial silicon CMOS image sensors can be thinned and
formed into accurate, highly curved optical surfaces with undiminished
functionality. Our key development is a pneumatic forming process that avoids
rigid mechanical constraints and suppresses wrinkling instabilities. A
combination of forming-mold design, pressure membrane elastic properties, and
controlled friction forces enables us to gradually contact the die at the
corners and smoothly press the sensor into a spherical shape. Allowing the die
to slide into the concave target shape enables a threefold increase in the
spherical curvature over prior approaches having mechanical constraints that
resist deformation, and create a high-stress, stretch-dominated state. Our
process creates a bridge between the high precision and low-cost but planar
CMOS process, and ideal non-planar component shapes such as spherical imagers
for improved optical systems. We demonstrate these curved sensors in prototype
cameras with custom lenses, measuring exceptional resolution of 3220
line-widths per picture height at an aperture of f/1.2 and nearly 100% relative
illumination across the field. Though we use a 1/2.3&quot; format image sensor in
this report, we also show this process is generally compatible with many state
of the art imaging sensor formats. By example, we report photogrammetry test
data for an APS-C sized silicon die formed to a 30$^\circ$ subtended spherical
angle. These gains in sharpness and relative illumination enable a new
generation of ultra-high performance, manufacturable, digital imaging systems
for scientific, industrial, and artistic use.

 <dc:description>  The problem of low complexity, close to optimal, channel decoding of linear
codes with short to moderate block length is considered. It is shown that deep
learning methods can be used to improve a standard belief propagation decoder,
despite the large example space. Similar improvements are obtained for the
min-sum algorithm. It is also shown that tying the parameters of the decoders
across iterations, so as to form a recurrent neural network architecture, can
be implemented with comparable results. The advantage is that significantly
less parameters are required. We also introduce a recurrent neural decoder
architecture based on the method of successive relaxation. Improvements over
standard belief propagation are also observed on sparser Tanner graph
representations of the codes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the neural
belief propagation decoder can be used to improve the performance, or
alternatively reduce the computational complexity, of a close to optimal
decoder of short BCH codes.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new system for generating art. The system generates art by
looking at art and learning about style; and becomes creative by increasing the
arousal potential of the generated art by deviating from the learned styles. We
build over Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which have shown the ability
to learn to generate novel images simulating a given distribution. We argue
that such networks are limited in their ability to generate creative products
in their original design. We propose modifications to its objective to make it
capable of generating creative art by maximizing deviation from established
styles and minimizing deviation from art distribution. We conducted experiments
to compare the response of human subjects to the generated art with their
response to art created by artists. The results show that human subjects could
not distinguish art generated by the proposed system from art generated by
contemporary artists and shown in top art fairs. Human subjects even rated the
generated images higher on various scales.

 <dc:description>  We investigate large-scale effects induced by external fields,
phenomenologically interpreted as mass media, in multiagent models evolving
with the microscopic dynamics of the binary naming game. In particular, we show
that a single external field, broadcasting information at regular time
intervals, can reverse the majority opinion of the population, provided the
frequency and the effectiveness of the sent messages lie above well-defined
thresholds. We study the phase structure of the model in the mean field
approximation and in numerical simulations with several network topologies. We
also investigate the influence on the agent dynamics of two competing external
fields, periodically broadcasting different messages. In finite regions of the
parameter space we observe periodic equilibrium states in which the average
opinion densities are reversed with respect to naive expectations. Such
equilibria occur in two cases: (i) when the frequencies of the competing
messages are different but close to each other; (ii) when the frequencies are
equal and the relative time shift of the messages does not exceed half a
period. We interpret the observed phenomena as a result of the interplay
between the external fields and the internal dynamics of the agents and
conclude that, depending on the model parameters, the naming game is consistent
with scenarios of first- or second-mover advantage (to borrow an expression
from the jargon of business strategy).

 <dc:description>  Randomized experiments are the gold standard for evaluating the effects of
changes to real-world systems, including Internet services. Data in these tests
may be difficult to collect and outcomes may have high variance, resulting in
potentially large measurement error. Bayesian optimization is a promising
technique for optimizing multiple continuous parameters for field experiments,
but existing approaches degrade in performance when the noise level is high. We
derive an exact expression for expected improvement under greedy batch
optimization with noisy observations and noisy constraints, and develop a
quasi-Monte Carlo approximation that allows it to be efficiently optimized.
Experiments with synthetic functions show that optimization performance on
noisy, constrained problems outperforms existing methods. We further
demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with two real experiments conducted
at Facebook: optimizing a production ranking system, and optimizing web server
compiler flags.

 <dc:description>  Many science and engineering applications involve solving a linear
least-squares system formed from some field measurements. In the distributed
cyber-physical systems (CPS), often each sensor node used for measurement only
knows partial independent rows of the least-squares system. To compute the
least-squares solution they need to gather all these measurement at a
centralized location and then compute the solution. These data collection and
computation are inefficient because of bandwidth and time constraints and
sometimes are infeasible because of data privacy concerns. Thus distributed
computations are strongly preferred or demanded in many of the real world
applications e.g.: smart-grid, target tracking etc. To compute least squares
for the large sparse system of linear equation iterative methods are natural
candidates and there are a lot of studies regarding this, however, most of them
are related to the efficiency of centralized/parallel computations while and
only a few are explicitly about distributed computation or have the potential
to apply in distributed networks. This paper surveys the representative
iterative methods from several research communities. Some of them were not
originally designed for this need, so we slightly modified them to suit our
requirement and maintain the consistency. In this survey, we sketch the
skeleton of the algorithm first and then analyze its time-to-completion and
communication cost. To our best knowledge, this is the first survey of
distributed least-squares in distributed networks.

 <dc:description>  Neural network models for dynamic systems can be trained either in parallel
or in series-parallel configurations. Influenced by early arguments, several
papers justify the choice of series-parallel rather than parallel configuration
claiming it has a lower computational cost, better stability properties during
training and provides more accurate results. Other published results, on the
other hand, defend parallel training as being more robust and capable of
yielding more accu- rate long-term predictions. The main contribution of this
paper is to present a study comparing both methods under the same unified
framework. We focus on three aspects: i) robustness of the estimation in the
presence of noise; ii) computational cost; and, iii) convergence. A unifying
mathematical framework and simulation studies show situations where each
training method provides better validation results, being parallel training
better in what is believed to be more realistic scenarios. An example using
measured data seems to reinforce such claim. We also show, with a novel
complexity analysis and numerical examples, that both methods have similar
computational cost, being series series-parallel training, however, more
amenable to parallelization. Some informal discussion about stability and
convergence properties is presented and explored in the examples.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of modeling spatiotemporal trajectories over long time
horizons using expert demonstrations. For instance, in sports, agents often
choose action sequences with long-term goals in mind, such as achieving a
certain strategic position. Conventional policy learning approaches, such as
those based on Markov decision processes, generally fail at learning cohesive
long-term behavior in such high-dimensional state spaces, and are only
effective when myopic modeling lead to the desired behavior. The key difficulty
is that conventional approaches are &quot;shallow&quot; models that only learn a single
state-action policy. We instead propose a hierarchical policy class that
automatically reasons about both long-term and short-term goals, which we
instantiate as a hierarchical neural network. We showcase our approach in a
case study on learning to imitate demonstrated basketball trajectories, and
show that it generates significantly more realistic trajectories compared to
non-hierarchical baselines as judged by professional sports analysts.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this study is to investigate the structure and evolution of
knowledge spillovers across technological domains. Specifically, dynamic
patterns of knowledge flow among 29 technological domains, measured by patent
citations for eight distinct periods, are identified and link prediction is
tested for capability for forecasting the evolution in these cross-domain
patent networks. The overall success of the predictions using the Katz metric
implies that there is a tendency to generate increased knowledge flows mostly
within the set of previously linked technological domains. This study
contributes to innovation studies by characterizing the structural change and
evolutionary behaviors in dynamic technology networks and by offering the basis
for predicting the emergence of future technological knowledge flows.

 <dc:description>  The place recognition problem comprises two distinct subproblems; recognizing
a specific location in the world (&quot;specific&quot; or &quot;ordinary&quot; place recognition)
and recognizing the type of place (place categorization). Both are important
competencies for mobile robots and have each received significant attention in
the robotics and computer vision community, but usually as separate areas of
investigation. In this paper, we leverage the powerful complementary nature of
place recognition and place categorization processes to create a new hybrid
place recognition system that uses place context to inform place recognition.
We show that semantic place categorization creates an informative natural
segmenting of physical space that in turn enables significantly better place
recognition performance in comparison to existing techniques. In particular,
this new semantically informed approach adds robustness to significant local
changes within the environment, such as transitioning between indoor and
outdoor environments or between dark and light rooms in a house, complementing
the capabilities of current condition-invariant techniques that are robust to
globally consistent change (such as day to night cycles). We perform
experiments using 4 benchmark and new datasets and show that
semantically-informed place recognition outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art systems. Like it does for object recognition [1], we believe
that semantics can play a key role in boosting conventional place recognition
and navigation performance for robotic systems.

 <dc:description>  Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs), which use low bitwidth numbers for
representing parameters and performing computations, have been proposed to
reduce the computation complexity, storage size and memory usage. In QNNs,
parameters and activations are uniformly quantized, such that the
multiplications and additions can be accelerated by bitwise operations.
However, distributions of parameters in Neural Networks are often imbalanced,
such that the uniform quantization determined from extremal values may under
utilize available bitwidth. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization
method that can ensure the balance of distributions of quantized values. Our
method first recursively partitions the parameters by percentiles into balanced
bins, and then applies uniform quantization. We also introduce computationally
cheaper approximations of percentiles to reduce the computation overhead
introduced. Overall, our method improves the prediction accuracies of QNNs
without introducing extra computation during inference, has negligible impact
on training speed, and is applicable to both Convolutional Neural Networks and
Recurrent Neural Networks. Experiments on standard datasets including ImageNet
and Penn Treebank confirm the effectiveness of our method. On ImageNet, the
top-5 error rate of our 4-bit quantized GoogLeNet model is 12.7\%, which is
superior to the state-of-the-arts of QNNs.

 <dc:description>  Animals (especially humans) have an amazing ability to learn new tasks
quickly, and switch between them flexibly. How brains support this ability is
largely unknown, both neuroscientifically and algorithmically. One reasonable
supposition is that modules drawing on an underlying general-purpose sensory
representation are dynamically allocated on a per-task basis. Recent results
from neuroscience and artificial intelligence suggest the role of the general
purpose visual representation may be played by a deep convolutional neural
network, and give some clues how task modules based on such a representation
might be discovered and constructed. In this work, we investigate module
architectures in an embodied two-dimensional touchscreen environment, in which
an agent's learning must occur via interactions with an environment that emits
images and rewards, and accepts touches as input. This environment is designed
to capture the physical structure of the task environments that are commonly
deployed in visual neuroscience and psychophysics. We show that in this
context, very simple changes in the nonlinear activations used by such a module
can significantly influence how fast it is at learning visual tasks and how
suitable it is for switching to new tasks.

 <dc:description>  Budgets play a significant role in real-world sequential auction markets such
as those implemented by Internet companies. To maximize the value provided to
auction participants, spending is smoothed across auctions so budgets are used
for the best opportunities. This paper considers a smoothing procedure that
relies on {\em pacing multipliers}: for each bidder, the platform applies a
factor between 0 and 1 that uniformly scales the bids across all auctions.
Looking at this process as a game between all bidders, we introduce the notion
of {\em pacing equilibrium}, and prove that they are always guaranteed to
exist. We demonstrate through examples that a market can have multiple pacing
equilibria with large variations in several natural objectives. We go on to
show that computing either a social-welfare-maximizing or a revenue-maximizing
pacing equilibrium is NP-hard. Finally, we develop a mixed-integer program
whose feasible solutions coincide with pacing equilibria, and show that it can
be used to find equilibria that optimize several interesting objectives. Using
our mixed-integer program, we perform numerical simulations on synthetic
auction markets that provide evidence that, in spite of the possibility of
equilibrium multiplicity, it occurs very rarely across several families of
random instances. We also show that solutions from the mixed-integer program
can be used to improve the outcomes achieved in a more realistic adaptive
pacing setting.

 <dc:description>  Pain is a personal, subjective experience that is commonly evaluated through
visual analog scales (VAS). While this is often convenient and useful,
automatic pain detection systems can reduce pain score acquisition efforts in
large-scale studies by estimating it directly from the participants' facial
expressions. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach for
VAS estimation: first, our algorithm employs Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
to automatically estimate Prkachin and Solomon Pain Intensity (PSPI) levels
from face images. The estimated scores are then fed into the personalized
Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRFs), used to estimate the VAS, provided by
each person. Personalization of the model is performed using a newly introduced
facial expressiveness score, unique for each person. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to automatically estimate VAS from face
images. We show the benefits of the proposed personalized over traditional
non-personalized approach on a benchmark dataset for pain analysis from face
images.

 <dc:title>Comparison of Time-Frequency Representations for Environmental Sound

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent successful applications of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
audio classification and speech recognition have motivated the search for
better input representations for more efficient training. Visual displays of an
audio signal, through various time-frequency representations such as
spectrograms offer a rich representation of the temporal and spectral structure
of the original signal. In this letter, we compare various popular signal
processing methods to obtain this representation, such as short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) with linear and Mel scales, constant-Q transform (CQT) and
continuous Wavelet transform (CWT), and assess their impact on the
classification performance of two environmental sound datasets using CNNs. This
study supports the hypothesis that time-frequency representations are valuable
in learning useful features for sound classification. Moreover, the actual
transformation used is shown to impact the classification accuracy, with
Mel-scaled STFT outperforming the other discussed methods slightly and baseline
MFCC features to a large degree. Additionally, we observe that the optimal
window size during transformation is dependent on the characteristics of the
audio signal and architecturally, 2D convolution yielded better results in most
cases compared to 1D.

 <dc:description>  Explaining the behavior of a black box machine learning model at the instance
level is useful for building trust. However, what is also important is
understanding how the model behaves globally. Such an understanding provides
insight into both the data on which the model was trained and the
generalization power of the rules it learned. We present here an approach that
learns rules to explain globally the behavior of black box machine learning
models. Collectively these rules represent the logic learned by the model and
are hence useful for gaining insight into its behavior. We demonstrate the
power of the approach on three publicly available data sets.

 <dc:description>  Currently, most speech processing techniques use magnitude spectrograms as
front-end and are therefore by default discarding part of the signal: the
phase. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose an end-to-end learning
method for speech denoising based on Wavenet. The proposed model adaptation
retains Wavenet's powerful acoustic modeling capabilities, while significantly
reducing its time-complexity by eliminating its autoregressive nature.
Specifically, the model makes use of non-causal, dilated convolutions and
predicts target fields instead of a single target sample. The discriminative
adaptation of the model we propose, learns in a supervised fashion via
minimizing a regression loss. These modifications make the model highly
parallelizable during both training and inference. Both computational and
perceptual evaluations indicate that the proposed method is preferred to Wiener
filtering, a common method based on processing the magnitude spectrogram.

 <dc:description>  Plane increasing trees are rooted labeled trees embedded into the plane such
that the sequence of labels is increasing on any branch starting at the root.
Relaxed binary trees are a subclass of unlabeled directed acyclic graphs. We
construct a bijection between these two combinatorial objects and study the
therefrom arising connections of certain parameters. Furthermore, we show
central limit theorems for two statistics on leaves. We end the study by
considering more than 20 subclasses and their bijective counterparts. Many of
these subclasses are enumerated by known counting sequences, and thus enrich
their combinatorial interpretation.

 <dc:title>Curvature-aware Manifold Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Yangyang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Traditional manifold learning algorithms assumed that the embedded manifold
is globally or locally isometric to Euclidean space. Under this assumption,
they divided manifold into a set of overlapping local patches which are locally
isometric to linear subsets of Euclidean space. By analyzing the global or
local isometry assumptions it can be shown that the learnt manifold is a flat
manifold with zero Riemannian curvature tensor. In general, manifolds may not
satisfy these hypotheses. One major limitation of traditional manifold learning
is that it does not consider the curvature information of manifold. In order to
remove these limitations, we present our curvature-aware manifold learning
algorithm called CAML. The purpose of our algorithm is to break the local
isometry assumption and to reduce the dimension of the general manifold which
is not isometric to Euclidean space. Thus, our method adds the curvature
information to the process of manifold learning. The experiments have shown
that our method CAML is more stable than other manifold learning algorithms by
comparing the neighborhood preserving ratios.

 <dc:description>  The gimbal-spacecraft system, that consists of a variable speed control
moment gyro (VSCMG) mounted inside a spacecraft, has been employed as an
actuator for the attitude control of a spacecraft and has been much studied in
the aerospace control community. Employing a Newtonian approach, the equations
of motion are derived, and further study focusses on singularity issues and
control law synthesis. While the geometric mechanics community has studied many
mechanical systems of engineering interest, including spinning rotors (or
momentum wheels) that are used as actuators, there has not been a particular
effort to model and control the gimbal-spacecraft system in a geometric
framework. This article serves two purposes: it presents the gimbal-spacecraft
system in a geometric mechanics framework, and in particular, highlights the
connection form, that could form the basis for future control design, and
secondly, the exposition is of a tutorial nature whereby the willing reader,
with minimal prerequisites, is introduced to the tools of differential geometry
in this context.

 <dc:description>  Shape analyses of tephra grains result in understanding eruption mechanism of
volcanoes. However, we have to define and select parameter set such as
convexity for the precise discrimination of tephra grains. Selection of the
best parameter set for the recognition of tephra shapes is complicated.
Actually, many shape parameters have been suggested. Recently, neural network
has made a great success in the field of machine learning. Convolutional neural
network can recognize the shape of images without human bias and shape
parameters. We applied the simple convolutional neural network developed for
the handwritten digits to the recognition of tephra shapes. The network was
trained by Morphologi tephra images, and it can recognize the tephra shapes
with approximately 90% of accuracy.

 <dc:description>  We introduce RelNet: a new model for relational reasoning. RelNet is a memory
augmented neural network which models entities as abstract memory slots and is
equipped with an additional relational memory which models relations between
all memory pairs. The model thus builds an abstract knowledge graph on the
entities and relations present in a document which can then be used to answer
questions about the document. It is trained end-to-end: only supervision to the
model is in the form of correct answers to the questions. We test the model on
the 20 bAbI question-answering tasks with 10k examples per task and find that
it solves all the tasks with a mean error of 0.3%, achieving 0% error on 11 of
the 20 tasks.

 <dc:description>  We describe a general framework --compressive statistical learning-- for
resource-efficient large-scale learning: the training collection is compressed
in one pass into a low-dimensional sketch (a vector of random empirical
generalized moments) that captures the information relevant to the considered
learning task. A near-minimizer of the risk is computed from the sketch through
the solution of a nonlinear least squares problem. We investigate sufficient
sketch sizes to control the generalization error of this procedure. The
framework is illustrated on compressive clustering, compressive Gaussian
mixture Modeling with fixed known variance, and compressive PCA.

 <dc:description>  Interactions between people are the basis on which the structure of our
society arises as a complex system and, at the same time, are the starting
point of any physical description of it. In the last few years, much
theoretical research has addressed this issue by combining the physics of
complex networks with a description of interactions in terms of evolutionary
game theory. We here take this research a step further by introducing a most
salient societal factor such as the individuals' preferences, a characteristic
that is key to understand much of the social phenomenology these days. We
consider a heterogeneous, agent-based model in which agents interact
strategically with their neighbors but their preferences and payoffs for the
possible actions differ. We study how such a heterogeneous network behaves
under evolutionary dynamics and different strategic interactions, namely
coordination games and best shot games. With this model we study the emergence
of the equilibria predicted analytically in random graphs under best response
dynamics, and we extend this test to unexplored contexts like proportional
imitation and scale free networks. We show that some theoretically predicted
equilibria do not arise in simulations with incomplete Information, and we
demonstrate the importance of the graph topology and the payoff function
parameters for some games. Finally, we discuss our results with available
experimental evidence on coordination games, showing that our model agrees
better with the experiment that standard economic theories, and draw hints as
to how to maximize social efficiency in situations of conflicting preferences.

 <dc:description>  Mobile payment systems are increasingly used to simplify the way in which
money transfers and transactions can be performed. We argue that, to achieve
their full potential as economic boosters in developing countries, mobile
payment systems need to rely on new metaphors suitable for the business models,
lifestyle, and technology availability conditions of the targeted communities.
The Pay-with-a-Group-Selfie (PGS) project, funded by the Melinda &amp; Bill Gates
Foundation, has developed a micro-payment system that supports everyday small
transactions by extending the reach of, rather than substituting, existing
payment frameworks. PGS is based on a simple gesture and a readily
understandable metaphor. The gesture - taking a selfie - has become part of the
lifestyle of mobile phone users worldwide, including non-technology-savvy ones.
The metaphor likens computing two visual shares of the selfie to ripping a
banknote in two, a technique used for decades for delayed payment in cash-only
markets. PGS is designed to work with devices with limited computational power
and when connectivity is patchy or not always available. Thanks to visual
cryptography techniques PGS uses for computing the shares, the original selfie
can be recomposed simply by stacking the shares, preserving the analogy with
re-joining the two parts of the banknote.

 <dc:description>  Fast computation of singular value decomposition (SVD) is of great interest
in various machine learning tasks. Recently, SVD methods based on randomized
linear algebra have shown significant speedup in this regime. This paper
attempts to further accelerate the computation by harnessing a modern computing
architecture, namely graphics processing unit (GPU), with the goal of
processing large-scale data that may not fit in the GPU memory. It leads to a
new block randomized algorithm that fully utilizes the power of GPUs and
efficiently processes large-scale data in an out-of- core fashion. Our
experiment shows that the proposed block randomized SVD (BRSVD) method
outperforms existing randomized SVD methods in terms of speed with retaining
the same accuracy. We also show its application to convex robust principal

 <dc:description>  The introduction of SDN in Service Providers' networks like GEANT is a
challenging task. Prototypes of new generation services have to exhibit
&quot;carrier grade&quot; characteristics, meet the high level expectations and
specialized needs of GEANT customers. In this demonstration, we present the SDN
based prototype of GEANT Open service, used by GEANT customers and approved
commercial partners to interconnect using Layer 2 circuits. Currently, this
service is delivered through a set of Open eXchange Points leveraging on legacy
solutions. The SDN based prototype has been realized on top of ONOS and
leverages on hardware switches for the data plane. During the demo, which runs
inside the GEANT Testbed Service, we show how operators can deploy services and
manage the SDN based infrastructure.

 <dc:description>  Context: Pre-publication peer review of scientific articles is considered a
key element of the research process in software engineering, yet it is often
perceived as not to work fully well.
  Objective: We aim at understanding the perceptions of and attitudes towards
peer review of authors and reviewers at one of software engineering's most
prestigious venues, the International Conference on Software Engineering
(ICSE).
  Method: We invited 932 ICSE 2014/15/16 authors and reviewers to participate
in a survey with 10 closed and 9 open questions.
  Results: We present a multitude of results, such as: Respondents perceive
only one third of all reviews to be good, yet one third as useless or
misleading; they propose double-blind or zero-blind reviewing regimes for
improvement; they would like to see showable proofs of (good) reviewing work be
introduced; attitude change trends are weak.
  Conclusion: The perception of the current state of software engineering peer
review is fairly negative. Also, we found hardly any trend that suggests
reviewing will improve by itself over time; the community will have to make
explicit efforts. Fortunately, our (mostly senior) respondents appear more open
for trying different peer reviewing regimes than we had expected.

 <dc:title>Synthesis of Near-regular Natural Textures</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>62-07, 93B50</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Texture synthesis is widely used in the field of computer graphics, vision,
and image processing. In the present paper, a texture synthesis algorithm is
proposed for near-regular natural textures with the help of a representative
periodic pattern extracted from the input textures using distance matching
function. Local texture statistics is then analyzed against global texture
statistics for non-overlapping windows of size same as periodic pattern size
and a representative periodic pattern is extracted from the image and used for
texture synthesis, while preserving the global regularity and visual
appearance. Validation of the algorithm based on experiments with synthetic
textures whose periodic pattern sizes are known and containing camouflages /
defects proves the strength of the algorithm for texture synthesis and its
application in detection of camouflages / defects in textures.

 <dc:title>Living Labs - An Ethical Challenge for Researchers and Platform

 <dc:creator>Schaer, Philipp</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The infamous Facebook emotion contagion experiment is one of the most
prominent and best-known online experiments based on the concept of what we
here call &quot;living labs&quot;. In these kinds of experiments, real-world applications
such as social web platforms trigger experimental switches inside their system
to present experimental changes to their users - most of the time without the
users being aware of their role as virtual guinea pigs. In the Facebook example
the researches changed the way users' personal timeline was compiled to test
the influence on the users' moods and feelings. The reactions to these
experiments showed the inherent ethical issues such living labs settings bring
up, mainly the study's lack of informed consent procedures, as well as a more
general critique of the flaws in the experimental design.
  In this chapter, we describe additional use cases: The so-called living labs
that focus on experimentation with information systems such as search engines
and wikis and especially on their real-world usage. The living labs paradigm
allows researchers to conduct research in real-world environments or systems.
In the field of information science and especially information retrieval -
which is the scientific discipline that is concerned with the research of
search engines, information systems, and search related algorithms and
techniques - it is still common practice to perform in vitro or offline
evaluations using static test collections. Living labs are widely unknown or
unavailable to academic researchers in these fields. A main benefit of living
labs is their potential to offer new ways and possibilities to experiment with
information systems and especially their users, but on the other hand they
introduce a whole set of ethical issues that we would like to address in this
chapter.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents ongoing research in the SWARMs project towards
facilitating context awareness in underwater robots. In particular, the focus
of this paper is put on the context reasoning part. The underwater environment
introduces uncertainties in context data which lead to difficulties in the
context reasoning phase. As probability is the best well-known formalism for
computational scientific reasoning under uncertainties, the emerging and
effective probabilistic reasoning method, namely, Multi-Entity Bayesian Network
(MEBN), is explored for its feasibility to reason under uncertainties in the
SWARMs project. A simple use case for oil spill monitoring is used to verify
the usefulness of MEBN. The results show that the MEBN is a promising approach
to reason about context in the presence of uncertainties in the underwater
robot field.

 <dc:description>  Workflows specify collections of tasks that must be executed under the
responsibility or supervision of human users. Workflow management systems and
workflow-driven applications need to enforce security policies in the form of
access control, specifying which users can execute which tasks, and
authorization constraints, such as Separation of Duty, further restricting the
execution of tasks at run-time. Enforcing these policies is crucial to avoid
frauds and malicious use, but it may lead to situations where a workflow
instance cannot be completed without the violation of the policy. The Workflow
Satisfiability Problem (WSP) asks whether there exists an assignment of users
to tasks in a workflow such that every task is executed and the policy is not
violated. The WSP is inherently hard, but solutions to this problem have a
practical application in reconciling business compliance and business
continuity. Solutions to related problems, such as workflow resiliency (i.e.,
whether a workflow instance is still satisfiable even in the absence of users),
are important to help in policy design. Several variations of the WSP and
similar problems have been defined in the literature and there are many
solution methods available. In this paper, we survey the work done on these
problems in the past 20 years.

 <dc:description>  Recently, a technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) was shown
to deliver insightful explanations in the form of input space relevances for
understanding feed-forward neural network classification decisions. In the
present work, we extend the usage of LRP to recurrent neural networks. We
propose a specific propagation rule applicable to multiplicative connections as
they arise in recurrent network architectures such as LSTMs and GRUs. We apply
our technique to a word-based bi-directional LSTM model on a five-class
sentiment prediction task, and evaluate the resulting LRP relevances both
qualitatively and quantitatively, obtaining better results than a
gradient-based related method which was used in previous work.

 <dc:description>  The Bulk Synchronous Parallel(BSP) computational model has emerged as the
dominant distributed framework to build large-scale iterative graph processing
systems. While its implementations(e.g., Pregel, Giraph, and Hama) achieve high
scalability, frequent synchronization and communication among the workers can
cause substantial parallel inefficiency. To help address this critical concern,
this paper introduces the GraphHP(Graph Hybrid Processing) platform which
inherits the friendly vertex-centric BSP programming interface and optimizes
its synchronization and communication overhead.
  To achieve the goal, we first propose a hybrid execution model which
differentiates between the computations within a graph partition and across the
partitions, and decouples the computations within a partition from distributed
synchronization and communication. By implementing the computations within a
partition by pseudo-superstep iteration in memory, the hybrid execution model
can effectively reduce synchronization and communication overhead while not
requiring heavy scheduling overhead or graph-centric sequential algorithms. We
then demonstrate how the hybrid execution model can be easily implemented
within the BSP abstraction to preserve its simple programming interface.
Finally, we evaluate our implementation of the GraphHP platform on classical
BSP applications and show that it performs significantly better than the
state-of-the-art BSP implementations. Our GraphHP implementation is based on
Hama, but can easily generalize to other BSP platforms.

 <dc:description>  To perform tasks specified by natural language instructions, autonomous
agents need to extract semantically meaningful representations of language and
map it to visual elements and actions in the environment. This problem is
called task-oriented language grounding. We propose an end-to-end trainable
neural architecture for task-oriented language grounding in 3D environments
which assumes no prior linguistic or perceptual knowledge and requires only raw
pixels from the environment and the natural language instruction as input. The
proposed model combines the image and text representations using a
Gated-Attention mechanism and learns a policy to execute the natural language
instruction using standard reinforcement and imitation learning methods. We
show the effectiveness of the proposed model on unseen instructions as well as
unseen maps, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also introduce a novel
environment based on a 3D game engine to simulate the challenges of
task-oriented language grounding over a rich set of instructions and
environment states.

 <dc:description>  Recognizer Output Voting Error Reduction (ROVER) has been widely used for
system combination in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In order to select
the most appropriate words to insert at each position in the output
transcriptions, some ROVER extensions rely on critical information such as
confidence scores and other ASR decoder features. This information, which is
not always available, highly depends on the decoding process and sometimes
tends to over estimate the real quality of the recognized words. In this paper
we propose a novel variant of ROVER that takes advantage of ASR quality
estimation (QE) for ranking the transcriptions at &quot;segment level&quot; instead of:
i) relying on confidence scores, or ii) feeding ROVER with randomly ordered
hypotheses. We first introduce an effective set of features to compensate for
the absence of ASR decoder information. Then, we apply QE techniques to perform
accurate hypothesis ranking at segment-level before starting the fusion
process. The evaluation is carried out on two different tasks, in which we
respectively combine hypotheses coming from independent ASR systems and
multi-microphone recordings. In both tasks, it is assumed that the ASR decoder
information is not available. The proposed approach significantly outperforms
standard ROVER and it is competitive with two strong oracles that e xploit
prior knowledge about the real quality of the hypotheses to be combined.
Compared to standard ROVER, the abs olute WER improvements in the two
evaluation scenarios range from 0.5% to 7.3%.

procedure. We argue that the process of detecting actions should be naturally
one of observation and refinement: observe the current window and refine the
span of attended window to cover true action regions. In this paper, we propose
an active action proposal model that learns to find actions through
continuously adjusting the temporal bounds in a self-adaptive way. The whole
process can be deemed as an agent, which is firstly placed at a position in the
video at random, adopts a sequence of transformations on the current attended
region to discover actions according to a learned policy. We utilize
reinforcement learning, especially the Deep Q-learning algorithm to learn the
agent's decision policy. In addition, we use temporal pooling operation to
extract more effective feature representation for the long temporal window, and
design a regression network to adjust the position offsets between predicted
results and the ground truth. Experiment results on THUMOS 2014 validate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, which can achieve competitive
performance with current action detection algorithms via much fewer proposals.

 <dc:title>Average Case Constant Factor Optimal Multi-Robot Path Planning in
  Well-Connected Environments</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yu, Jingjin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Fast algorithms for optimal multi-robot path planning are sought after in
many real-world applications. Known methods, however, generally do not
simultaneously guarantee good solution optimality and fast run time (e.g.,
polynomial). In this work, we develop a low-polynomial running time algorithm,
called SplitAndGroup (SAG),that solves the multi-robot path planning problem on
grids and grid-like environments and produces constant factor makespan-optimal
solutions in the average case. That is, SAG is an average case
O(1)-approximation algorithm. SAG computes solutions with sub-linear makespan
and is capable of handling cases when the density of robots is extremely high -
in a graph-theoretic setting, the algorithm supports cases where all vertices
of the underlying graph are occupied by robots. SAG attains its desirable
properties through a careful combination of divide-and-conquer technique and
network flow based methods for routing the robots. Solutions from SAG, in a
weaker sense, is also a constant factor approximation on total distance
optimality.

 <dc:description>  CFI is a computer security technique that detects runtime attacks by
monitoring a program's branching behavior. This work presents a detailed
analysis of the security policies enforced by 21 recent hardware-based CFI
architectures. The goal is to evaluate the security, limitations, hardware
cost, performance, and practicality of using these policies. We show that many
architectures are not suitable for widespread adoption, since they have
practical issues, such as relying on accurate control flow model (which is
difficult to obtain) or they implement policies which provide only limited
security.

 <dc:description>  Tissue oxygenation and perfusion can be an indicator for organ viability
during minimally invasive surgery, for example allowing real-time assessment of
tissue perfusion and oxygen saturation. Multispectral imaging is an optical
modality that can inspect tissue perfusion in wide field images without
contact. In this paper, we present a novel, fast method for using RGB images
for MSI, which while limiting the spectral resolution of the modality allows
normal laparoscopic systems to be used. We exploit the discrete Haar
decomposition to separate individual video frames into low pass and directional
coefficients and we utilise a different multispectral estimation technique on
each. The increase in speed is achieved by using fast Tikhonov regularisation
on the directional coefficients and more accurate Bayesian estimation on the
low pass component. The pipeline is implemented using a graphics processing
unit (GPU) architecture and achieves a frame rate of approximately 15Hz. We
validate the method on animal models and on human data captured using a da
Vinci stereo laparoscope.

 <dc:title>Explanation in Artificial Intelligence: Insights from the Social
  Sciences</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Miller, Tim</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There has been a recent resurgence in the area of explainable artificial
intelligence as researchers and practitioners seek to provide more transparency
to their algorithms. Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining
decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to
say that, if these techniques are to succeed, the explanations they generate
should have a structure that humans accept. However, it is fair to say that
most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers'
intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exists vast and
valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of
how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations. This
paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence should build
on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy,
cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics.
It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be
infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.

 <dc:description>  In engineering, it is a common desire to couple existing simulation tools
together into one big system by passing information from subsystems as
parameters into the subsystems under influence. As executed at fixed time
points, this data exchange gives the global method a strong explicit component,
and as flows of conserved quantities are passed across subsystem boundaries, it
is not ensured that systemwide balances are fulfilled: the system is not solved
as one single equation system. These balance errors can accumulate and make
simulation results inaccurate. Use of higher-order extrapolation in exchanged
data can reduce this problem but cannot solve it. The remaining balance error
has been handled in past work with balance correction methods which compensate
these errors by adding corrections for the balances to the signal in next
coupling time step. Further past work combined smooth extrapolation of
exchanged data and balance correction. This gives rise to the problem that
establishing balance of one quantity a posteriori due to the time delay in
general cannot establish or even disturbs the balances of quantities that
depend on the exchanged quantities, usually energy. In this work, a method is
suggested which allows to choose the quantity that should be balanced to be
that energy, and to accurately balance it.

 <dc:description>  Word embedding models such as Skip-gram learn a vector-space representation
for each word, based on the local word collocation patterns that are observed
in a text corpus. Latent topic models, on the other hand, take a more global
view, looking at the word distributions across the corpus to assign a topic to
each word occurrence. These two paradigms are complementary in how they
represent the meaning of word occurrences. While some previous works have
already looked at using word embeddings for improving the quality of latent
topics, and conversely, at using latent topics for improving word embeddings,
such &quot;two-step&quot; methods cannot capture the mutual interaction between the two
paradigms. In this paper, we propose STE, a framework which can learn word
embeddings and latent topics in a unified manner. STE naturally obtains
topic-specific word embeddings, and thus addresses the issue of polysemy. At
the same time, it also learns the term distributions of the topics, and the
topic distributions of the documents. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the STE model can indeed generate useful topic-specific word embeddings and
coherent latent topics in an effective and efficient way.

 <dc:title>New Cardinality Estimation Methods for HyperLogLog Sketches</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ertl, Otmar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work presents new cardinality estimation methods for data sets recorded
by HyperLogLog sketches. A simple derivation of the original estimator was
found, that also gives insight how to correct its deficiencies. The result is
an improved estimator that is unbiased over the full cardinality range, is easy
computable, and does not rely on empirically determined data as previous
approaches. Based on the maximum likelihood principle a second unbiased
estimation method is presented which can also be extended to estimate
cardinalities of union, intersection, or relative complements of two sets that
are both represented as HyperLogLog sketches. Experimental results show that
this approach is more precise than the conventional technique using the
inclusion-exclusion principle.

 <dc:description>  Technological advancement in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) has made it
become an invaluable component of a reliable environmental monitoring system;
they form the digital skin' through which to 'sense' and collect the context of
the surroundings and provides information on the process leading to complex
events such as drought. However, these environmental properties are measured by
various heterogeneous sensors of different modalities in distributed locations
making up the WSN, using different abstruse terms and vocabulary in most cases
to denote the same observed property, causing data heterogeneity. Adding
semantics and understanding the relationships that exist between the observed
properties, and augmenting it with local indigenous knowledge is necessary for
an accurate drought forecasting system. In this paper, we propose the framework
for the semantic representation of sensor data and integration with indigenous
knowledge on drought using a middleware for an efficient drought forecasting
system.

 <dc:description>  Different subsystems of organisms adapt over many time scales, such as rapid
changes in the nervous system (learning), slower morphological and neurological
change over the lifetime of the organism (postnatal development), and change
over many generations (evolution). Much work has focused on instantiating
learning or evolution in robots, but relatively little on development. Although
many theories have been forwarded as to how development can aid evolution, it
is difficult to isolate each such proposed mechanism. Thus, here we introduce a
minimal yet embodied model of development: the body of the robot changes over
its lifetime, yet growth is not influenced by the environment. We show that
even this simple developmental model confers evolvability because it allows
evolution to sweep over a larger range of body plans than an equivalent
non-developmental system, and subsequent heterochronic mutations 'lock in' this
body plan in more morphologically-static descendants. Future work will involve
gradually complexifying the developmental model to determine when and how such
added complexity increases evolvability.

complex networks. Various definitions for this measure have been proposed for
the cases of networks having weighted edges, but less attention has been paid
to both weighted and directed networks. We provide a new local clustering
coefficient for this kind of networks, starting from those existing in the
literature for the weighted and undirected case. Furthermore, we extract from
our coefficient four specific components, in order to separately consider
different link patterns of triangles. Empirical applications on several real
networks from different frameworks and with different order are provided. The
performance of our coefficient is also compared with that of existing
coefficients in the literature.

 <dc:description>  The Internet topology is of high importance in designing networks and
architectures, evaluating performance, and economics. Interconnections between
domains (ASes), routers, and points of presence (PoPs), have been measured,
analyzed, and modeled. However, existing models have some serious shortcomings,
related to ease, accuracy and completeness of measurements, and limited
applicability to emerging research areas. To this end, in this paper, we
propose a novel approach towards capturing the inter-domain Internet topology.
Motivated by the recent interest in the Internet eXchange Points (IXPs), we
introduce a network graph model based on IXPs and their AS memberships. The
proposed model aims to complement previous modeling efforts, shed light on
unexplored characteristics of the Internet topology, and support new research
directions. We also collect and make available Internet connectivity data,
analyze main topological properties, and discuss application-related issues.

 <dc:title>A universal negative group delay filter for the prediction of
  band-limited signals</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Voss, Henning U.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A filter for universal real-time prediction of band-limited signals is
presented. The filter consists of multiple time-delayed feedback terms in order
to accomplish anticipatory coupling, which again leads to a negative group
delay for frequencies in the baseband. The universality of the filter arises
from its property that it does not rely on a specific model of the signal.
Specifically, as long as the signal to be predicted is band-limited with a
known cutoff frequency, the filter order, the only parameter of the filter,
follows and the filter predicts the signal in real time up to a prediction
horizon that depends on the cutoff frequency, too. It is worked out in detail
how signal prediction arises from the negative group delay of the filter. Its
properties, including stability, are investigated theoretically, by numerical
simulations, and by application to a physiological signal. Possible control and
signal processing applications of this filter are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Ethical thought experiments such as the trolley dilemma have been
investigated extensively in the past, showing that humans act in a utilitarian
way, trying to cause as little overall damage as possible. These trolley
dilemmas have gained renewed attention over the past years; especially due to
the necessity of implementing moral decisions in autonomous driving vehicles.
We conducted a set of experiments in which participants experienced modified
trolley dilemmas as the driver in a virtual reality environment. Participants
had to make decisionsbetween two discrete options: driving on one of two lanes
where different obstacles came into view. Obstacles included a variety of
human-like avatars of different ages and group sizes. Furthermore, we tested
the influence of a sidewalk as a potential safe harbor and a condition
implicating a self-sacrifice. Results showed that subjects, in general, decided
in a utilitarian manner, sparing the highest number of avatars possible with a
limited influence of the other variables. Our findings support that human
behavior is in line with the utilitarian approach to moral decision making.
This may serve as a guideline for the implementation of moral decisions in
ADVs.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Ball and hoop system is a well-known model for the education of linear
control systems. In this paper, we have a look at this system from another
perspective and show that it is also suitable for demonstration of more
advanced control techniques. In contrast to the standard use, we describe the
dynamics of the system at full length; in addition to the mode where the ball
rolls on the (outer) hoop we also consider the mode where the ball drops out of
the hoop and enters a free-fall mode. Furthermore, we add another (inner) hoop
in the center upon which the ball can land from the free-fall mode. This
constitutes another mode of the hybrid description of the system. We present
two challenging tasks for this model and show how they can be solved by
trajectory generation and stabilization. We also describe how such a model can
be built and experimentally verify the validity of our approach solving the
proposed tasks.

 <dc:description>  Automated cardiac image interpretation has the potential to transform
clinical practice in multiple ways including enabling low-cost serial
assessment of cardiac function in the primary care and rural setting. We
hypothesized that advances in computer vision could enable building a fully
automated, scalable analysis pipeline for echocardiogram (echo) interpretation.
Our approach entailed: 1) preprocessing; 2) convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for view identification, image segmentation, and phasing of the cardiac cycle;
3) quantification of chamber volumes and left ventricular mass; 4) particle
tracking to compute longitudinal strain; and 5) targeted disease detection.
CNNs accurately identified views (e.g. 99% for apical 4-chamber) and segmented
individual cardiac chambers. Cardiac structure measurements agreed with study
report values (e.g. mean absolute deviations (MAD) of 7.7 mL/kg/m2 for left
ventricular diastolic volume index, 2918 studies). We computed automated
ejection fraction and longitudinal strain measurements (within 2 cohorts),
which agreed with commercial software-derived values [for ejection fraction,
MAD=5.3%, N=3101 studies; for strain, MAD=1.5% (n=197) and 1.6% (n=110)], and
demonstrated applicability to serial monitoring of breast cancer patients for
trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Overall, we found that, compared to manual
measurements, automated measurements had superior performance across seven
internal consistency metrics with an average increase in the Spearman
correlation coefficient of 0.05 (p=0.02). Finally, we developed disease
detection algorithms for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardiac amyloidosis,
with C-statistics of 0.93 and 0.84, respectively. Our pipeline lays the
groundwork for using automated interpretation to support point-of-care handheld
cardiac ultrasound and large-scale analysis of the millions of echos archived
within healthcare systems.

 <dc:description>  Automatic segmentation of an organ and its cystic region is a prerequisite of
computer-aided diagnosis. In this paper, we focus on pancreatic cyst
segmentation in abdominal CT scan. This task is important and very useful in
clinical practice yet challenging due to the low contrast in boundary, the
variability in location, shape and the different stages of the pancreatic
cancer. Inspired by the high relevance between the location of a pancreas and
its cystic region, we introduce extra deep supervision into the segmentation
network, so that cyst segmentation can be improved with the help of relatively
easier pancreas segmentation. Under a reasonable transformation function, our
approach can be factorized into two stages, and each stage can be efficiently
optimized via gradient back-propagation throughout the deep networks. We
collect a new dataset with 131 pathological samples, which, to the best of our
knowledge, is the largest set for pancreatic cyst segmentation. Without human
assistance, our approach reports a 63.44% average accuracy, measured by the
Dice-S{\o}rensen coefficient (DSC), which is higher than the number (60.46%)
without deep supervision.

 <dc:description>  We study the reachability problem for systems implemented as feed-forward
neural networks whose activation function is implemented via ReLU functions. We
draw a correspondence between establishing whether some arbitrary output can
ever be outputed by a neural system and linear problems characterising a neural
system of interest. We present a methodology to solve cases of practical
interest by means of a state-of-the-art linear programs solver. We evaluate the
technique presented by discussing the experimental results obtained by
analysing reachability properties for a number of benchmarks in the literature.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of minimizing a convex function over a convex set
given access only to an evaluation oracle for the function and a membership
oracle for the set. We give a simple algorithm which solves this problem with
$\tilde{O}(n^2)$ oracle calls and $\tilde{O}(n^3)$ additional arithmetic
operations. Using this result, we obtain more efficient reductions among the
five basic oracles for convex sets and functions defined by Gr\&quot;otschel, Lovasz
and Schrijver.

 <dc:description>  Cell segmentation and tracking allow us to extract a plethora of cell
attributes from bacterial time-lapse cell movies, thus promoting computational
modeling and simulation of biological processes down to the single-cell level.
However, to analyze successfully complex cell movies, imaging multiple
interacting bacterial clones as they grow and merge to generate overcrowded
bacterial communities with thousands of cells in the field of view,
segmentation results should be near perfect to warrant good tracking results.
We introduce here a fully automated closed-loop bio-inspired computational
strategy that exploits prior knowledge about the expected structure of a
colony's lineage tree to locate and correct segmentation errors in analyzed
movie frames. We show that this correction strategy is effective, resulting in
improved cell tracking and consequently trustworthy deep colony lineage trees.
Our image analysis approach has the unique capability to keep tracking cells
even after clonal subpopulations merge in the movie. This enables the
reconstruction of the complete Forest of Lineage Trees (FLT) representation of
evolving multi-clonal bacterial communities. Moreover, the percentage of valid
cell trajectories extracted from the image analysis almost doubles after
segmentation correction. This plethora of trustworthy data extracted from a
complex cell movie analysis enables single-cell analytics as a tool for
addressing compelling questions for human health, such as understanding the
role of single-cell stochasticity in antibiotics resistance without losing site
of the inter-cellular interactions and microenvironment effects that may shape
it.

promotes modeling biological processes at the single-cell level. We introduce a
new fully automated computational strategy to track accurately cells across
frames in time-lapse movies. Our method is based on a dynamic neighborhoods
formation and matching approach, inspired by motion estimation algorithms for
video compression. Moreover, it exploits &quot;divide and conquer&quot; opportunities to
solve effectively the challenging cells tracking problem in overcrowded

demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed method remains very high (exceeds
97%) even when analyzing large overcrowded microbial colonies.

 <dc:description>  Emerging smart infrastructures, such as Smart City, Smart Grid, Smart Health,
and Smart Transportation, need smart wireless connectivity. However, the
requirements of these smart infrastructures cannot be met with today's wireless
networks. A new wireless infrastructure is needed to meet unprecedented needs
in terms of agility, reliability, security, scalability, and partnerships.
  We are at the beginning of a revolution in how we live with technology,
resulting from a convergence of machine learning (ML), the Internet-of-Things
(IoT), and robotics. A smart infrastructure monitors and processes a vast
amount of data, collected from a dense and wide distribution of heterogeneous
sensors (e.g., the IoT), as well as from web applications like social media. In
real time, using machine learning, patterns and relationships in the data over
space, time, and application can be detected and predictions can be made; on
the basis of these, resources can be managed, decisions can be made, and
devices can be actuated to optimize metrics, such as cost, health, safety, and
convenience.

 <dc:description>  Graphs are a useful abstraction of image content. Not only can graphs
represent details about individual objects in a scene but they can capture the
interactions between pairs of objects. We present a method for training a
convolutional neural network such that it takes in an input image and produces
a full graph. This is done end-to-end in a single stage with the use of
associative embeddings. The network learns to simultaneously identify all of
the elements that make up a graph and piece them together. We benchmark on the
Visual Genome dataset, and report a Recall@50 of 9.7% compared to the prior
state-of-the-art at 3.4%, a nearly threefold improvement on the challenging
task of scene graph generation.

 <dc:description>  The actor model is an attractive foundation for developing concurrent
applications because actors are isolated concurrent entities that communicate
through asynchronous messages and do not share state. Thus, they avoid common
concurrency bugs such as data races. However, they are not immune to
concurrency bugs in general. This paper studies concurrency bugs in actor-based
programs reported in literature. We define a taxonomy for these bugs.
Furthermore, we analyze the bugs to identify the patterns causing them as well
as their observable behavior. Based on our taxonomy, we further analyze the
literature and find that current approaches to static analysis and testing
focus on communication deadlocks and message protocol violations. However, they
do not provide solutions to identify livelocks and behavioral deadlocks. We
propose a research roadmap of the main debugging techniques that can help to
support the development of actor-based programs.

 <dc:description>  A CM-order is a reduced order equipped with an involution that mimics complex
conjugation. The Witt-Picard group of such an order is a certain group of ideal
classes that is closely related to the &quot;minus part&quot; of the class group. We
present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for the following problem,
which may be viewed as a special case of the principal ideal testing problem:
given a CM-order, decide whether two given elements of its Witt-Picard group
are equal. In order to prevent coefficient blow-up, the algorithm operates with
lattices rather than with ideals. An important ingredient is a technique
introduced by Gentry and Szydlo in a cryptographic context. Our application of
it to lattices over CM-orders hinges upon a novel existence theorem for
auxiliary ideals, which we deduce from a result of Konyagin and Pomerance in
elementary number theory.

 <dc:description>  Fine-grained categorization can benefit from part-based features which reveal
subtle visual differences between object categories. Handcrafted features have
been widely used for part detection and classification. Although a recent trend
seeks to learn such features automatically using powerful deep learning models
such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), their training and possibly also
testing require manually provided annotations which are costly to obtain. To
relax these requirements, we assume in this study a general problem setting in
which the raw images are only provided with object-level class labels for model
training with no other side information needed. Specifically, by extracting and
interpreting the hierarchical hidden layer features learned by a CNN, we
propose an elaborate CNN-based system for fine-grained categorization. When
evaluated on the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011, FGVC-Aircraft, Cars and Stanford
dogs datasets under the setting that only object-level class labels are used
for training and no other annotations are available for both training and
testing, our method achieves impressive performance that is superior or
comparable to the state of the art. Moreover, it sheds some light on ingenious
use of the hierarchical features learned by CNN which has wide applicability
well beyond the current fine-grained categorization task.

 <dc:description>  Rips complexes are important structures for analyzing topological features of
metric spaces. Unfortunately, generating these complexes constitutes an
expensive task because of a combinatorial explosion in the complex size. For
$n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we present a scheme to construct a
$3\sqrt{2}$-approximation of the multi-scale filtration of the $L_\infty$-Rips
complex, which extends to a $O(d^{0.25})$-approximation of the Rips filtration
for the Euclidean case. The $k$-skeleton of the resulting approximation has a
total size of $n2^{O(d\log k)}$. The scheme is based on the integer lattice and
on the barycentric subdivision of the $d$-cube.

 <dc:description>  A grand challenge for power grid management lies in how to plan and operate
with increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as
solar photovoltaics and electric vehicles, which disturb the power grid
stability. Existing approaches are unable to verify if a point is on a
loadability boundary or characterize all loadability boundary points exactly.
This inability leads to a poor understanding of locational hosting capacity for
accommodating distributed resources. To solve these problems, we compare
existing approaches and propose a rectangular coordinate-based analysis, which
drew less attention in the past. We demonstrate that such a coordinate (1)
provides an integrated geometric understanding of active and reactive power
flow equations, (2) enables linear representation of elements in the Jacobian
matrix, (3) verifies if an operating point is on the loadability boundary and
what is the margin, and ($4$) characterizes the power flow feasibility boundary
points. Finally, IEEE standard test cases demonstrate the capability of the new
method.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a thorough analysis of the nature of news in
different mediums across the ages, introducing a unique mathematical model to
fit the characteristics of information spread. This model enhances the
information diffusion model to account for conflicting information and the
topical distribution of news in terms of popularity for a given era. We
translate this information to a separate graphical node model to determine the
spread of a news item given a certain category and relevance factor. The two
models are used as a base for a simulation of information dissemination for
varying graph topoligies. The simulation is stress-tested and compared against
real-world data to prove its relevancy. We are then able to use these
simulations to deduce some conclusive statements about the optimization of
information spread.

 <dc:description>  An unconstrained nonlinear binary optimization problem of selecting a maximum
expected value subset of items is considered. Each item is associated with a
profit and probability. Each of the items succeeds or fails independently with
the given probabilities, and the profit is obtained in the event that all
selected items succeed. The objective is to select a subset that maximizes the
total value times the product of probabilities of the chosen items. The problem
is proven NP-hard by a nontrivial reduction from subset sum. Then we develop a
fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for this problem.

 <dc:description>  We examine the coordinated and universal rate-efficient sampling of a subset
of correlated discrete memoryless sources followed by lossy compression of the
sampled sources. The goal is to reconstruct a predesignated subset of sources
within a specified level of distortion. The combined sampling mechanism and
rate distortion code are universal in that they are devised to perform robustly
without exact knowledge of the underlying joint probability distribution of the
sources. In Bayesian as well as nonBayesian settings, single-letter
characterizations are provided for the universal sampling rate distortion
function for fixed-set sampling, independent random sampling and memoryless
random sampling. It is illustrated how these sampling mechanisms are
successively better. Our achievability proofs bring forth new schemes for joint
source distribution-learning and lossy compression.

 <dc:description>  Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and for each vertex $v \in V$ a subset $B(v)$ of the
set $\{0,1,\ldots, d_G(v)\}$, where $d_G(v)$ denotes the degree of vertex $v$
in the graph $G$, a $B$-factor of $G$ is any set $F \subseteq E$ such that
$d_F(v) \in B(v)$ for each vertex $v$, where $d_F(v)$ denotes the number of
edges of $F$ incident to $v$. The general factor problem asks the existence of
a $B$-factor in a given graph. A set $B(v)$ is said to have a {\em gap of
length} $p$ if there exists a natural number $k \in B(v)$ such that $k+1,
\ldots, k+p \notin B(v)$ and $k+p+1 \in B(v)$. Without any restrictions the
general factor problem is NP-complete. However, if no set $B(v)$ contains a gap
of length greater than $1$, then the problem can be solved in polynomial time
and Cornuejols \cite{Cor} presented an algorithm for finding a $B$-factor, if
it exists. In this paper we consider a weighted version of the general factor
problem, in which each edge has a nonnegative weight and we are interested in
finding a $B$-factor of maximum (or minimum) weight. In particular, this
version comprises the minimum/maximum cardinality variant of the general factor
problem, where we want to find a $B$-factor having a minimum/maximum number of
edges.
  We present an algorithm for the maximum/minimum weight $B$-factor for the
case when no set $B(v)$ contains a gap of length greater than $1$. This also
yields the first polynomial time algorithm for the maximum/minimum cardinality
$B$-factor for this case.

 <dc:description>  An important aspect of examining printed documents for potential forgeries
and copyright infringement is the identification of source printer as it can be
helpful for ascertaining the leak and detecting forged documents. This paper
proposes a system for classification of source printer from scanned images of
printed documents using all the printed letters simultaneously. This system
uses local texture patterns based features and a single classifier for
classifying all the printed letters. Letters are extracted from scanned images
using connected component analysis followed by morphological filtering without
the need of using an OCR. Each letter is sub-divided into a flat region and an
edge region, and local tetra patterns are estimated separately for these two
regions. A strategically constructed pooling technique is used to extract the
final feature vectors. The proposed method has been tested on both a publicly
available dataset of 10 printers and a new dataset of 18 printers scanned at a
resolution of 600 dpi as well as 300 dpi printed in four different fonts. The
results indicate shape independence property in the proposed method as using a
single classifier it outperforms existing handcrafted feature-based methods and
needs much smaller number of training pages by using all the printed letters.

 <dc:description>  Due to their cost, performance, area, and energy efficiency, MPSoCs offer
appealing architecture for emerging mixed criticality systems (MCS) such as
driverless cars, smart power grids, and healthcare devices. Furthermore,
heterogeneity of MPSoCs presents exceptional opportunities to satisfy the
conflicting requirements of MCS. Seizing these opportunities is unattainable
without addressing the associated challenges. We focus on four aspects of MCS
that we believe are of most importance upon adopting MPSoCs: theoretical model,
interference, data sharing, and security. We outline existing solutions,
highlight the necessary considerations for MPSoCs including both opportunities
they create and research directions yet to be explored.

 <dc:description>  End-to-end training of neural networks is a promising approach to automatic
construction of dialog systems using a human-to-human dialog corpus. Recently,
Vinyals et al. tested neural conversation models using OpenSubtitles. Lowe et
al. released the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus for researching unstructured multi-turn
dialogue systems. Furthermore, the approach has been extended to accomplish
task oriented dialogs to provide information properly with natural
conversation. For example, Ghazvininejad et al. proposed a knowledge grounded
neural conversation model [3], where the research is aiming at combining
conversational dialogs with task-oriented knowledge using unstructured data
such as Twitter data for conversation and Foursquare data for external
knowledge.However, the task is still limited to a restaurant information
service, and has not yet been tested with a wide variety of dialog tasks. In
addition, it is still unclear how to create intelligent dialog systems that can
respond like a human agent.
  In consideration of these problems, we proposed a challenge track to the 6th
dialog system technology challenges (DSTC6) using human-to-human dialog data to
mimic human dialog behaviors. The focus of the challenge track is to train
end-to-end conversation models from human-to-human conversation and accomplish
end-to-end dialog tasks in various situations assuming a customer service, in
which a system plays a role of human agent and generates natural and
informative sentences in response to user's questions or comments given dialog
context.

 <dc:description>  The exquisite sensitivity of the advanced LIGO detectors has enabled the
detection of multiple gravitational wave signals. The sophisticated design of
these detectors mitigates the effect of most types of noise. However, advanced
LIGO data streams are contaminated by numerous artifacts known as glitches:
non-Gaussian noise transients with complex morphologies. Given their high rate
of occurrence, glitches can lead to false coincident detections, obscure and
even mimic gravitational wave signals. Therefore, successfully characterizing
and removing glitches from advanced LIGO data is of utmost importance. Here, we
present the first application of Deep Transfer Learning for glitch
classification, showing that knowledge from deep learning algorithms trained
for real-world object recognition can be transferred for classifying glitches
in time-series based on their spectrogram images. Using the Gravity Spy
dataset, containing hand-labeled, multi-duration spectrograms obtained from
real LIGO data, we demonstrate that this method enables optimal use of very
deep convolutional neural networks for classification given small training
datasets, significantly reduces the time for training the networks, and
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy above 98.8%, with perfect precision-recall
on 8 out of 22 classes. Furthermore, new types of glitches can be classified
accurately given few labeled examples with this technique. Once trained via
transfer learning, we show that the convolutional neural networks can be
truncated and used as excellent feature extractors for unsupervised clustering
methods to identify new classes based on their morphology, without any labeled
examples. Therefore, this provides a new framework for dynamic glitch
classification for gravitational wave detectors, which are expected to
encounter new types of noise as they undergo gradual improvements to attain
design sensitivity.

 <dc:description>  Artificial agents will need to be aware of human moral and social norms, and
able to use them in decision-making. In particular, artificial agents will need
a principled approach to managing conflicting norms, which are common in human
social interactions. Existing logic-based approaches suffer from normative
explosion and are typically designed for deterministic environments;
reward-based approaches lack principled ways of determining which normative
alternatives exist in a given environment. We propose a hybrid approach, using
Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) representations in Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs), that manages norm conflicts in a systematic manner while accommodating
domain stochasticity. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation in a
simulated vacuum cleaning domain.

 <dc:description>  Many inverse problems are formulated as optimization problems over certain
appropriate input distributions. Recently, there has been a growing interest in
understanding the computational hardness of these optimization problems, not
only in the worst case, but in an average-complexity sense under this same
input distribution.
  In this note, we are interested in studying another aspect of hardness,
related to the ability to learn how to solve a problem by simply observing a
collection of previously solved instances. These are used to supervise the
training of an appropriate predictive model that parametrizes a broad class of
algorithms, with the hope that the resulting &quot;algorithm&quot; will provide good
accuracy-complexity tradeoffs in the average sense.
  We illustrate this setup on the Quadratic Assignment Problem, a fundamental
problem in Network Science. We observe that data-driven models based on Graph
Neural Networks offer intriguingly good performance, even in regimes where
standard relaxation based techniques appear to suffer.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we analyze the spatial information of deep features, and
propose two complementary regressions for robust visual tracking. First, we
propose a kernelized ridge regression model wherein the kernel value is defined
as the weighted sum of similarity scores of all pairs of patches between two
samples. We show that this model can be formulated as a neural network and thus
can be efficiently solved. Second, we propose a fully convolutional neural
network with spatially regularized kernels, through which the filter kernel
corresponding to each output channel is forced to focus on a specific region of
the target. Distance transform pooling is further exploited to determine the
effectiveness of each output channel of the convolution layer. The outputs from
the kernelized ridge regression model and the fully convolutional neural
network are combined to obtain the ultimate response. Experimental results on
three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

weak exponential time. That is, out of a set of exponentially small measure in
the space of data the cost of the algorithm is exponential in the size of the
data. All algorithms previously proposed for this problem have a complexity
which is doubly exponential (and this is so for almost all data).

 <dc:description>  We develop efficient parameterized, with additive error, approximation
algorithms for the (Connected) $r$-Domination problem and the (Connected)
$p$-Center problem for unweighted and undirected graphs. Given a graph $G$, we
show how to construct a (connected) $\big(r + \mathcal{O}(\mu)
\big)$-dominating set $D$ with $|D| \leq |D^*|$ efficiently. Here, $D^*$ is a
minimum (connected) $r$-dominating set of $G$ and $\mu$ is our graph parameter,
which is the tree-breadth or the cluster diameter in a layering partition of
$G$. Additionally, we show that a $+ \mathcal{O}(\mu)$-approximation for the
(Connected) $p$-Center problem on $G$ can be computed in polynomial time. Our
interest in these parameters stems from the fact that in many real-world
networks, including Internet application networks, web networks, collaboration
networks, social networks, biological networks, and others, and in many
structured classes of graphs these parameters are small constants.

 <dc:title>Binary Latent Representations for Efficient Ranking: Empirical
  Assessment</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kula, Maciej</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Large-scale recommender systems often face severe latency and storage
constraints at prediction time. These are particularly acute when the number of
items that could be recommended is large, and calculating predictions for the
full set is computationally intensive. In an attempt to relax these
constraints, we train recommendation models that use binary rather than
real-valued user and item representations, and show that while they are
substantially faster to evaluate, the gains in speed come at a large cost in
accuracy. In our Movielens 1M experiments, we show that reducing the latent
dimensionality of traditional models offers a more attractive accuracy/speed
trade-off than using binary representations.

minimum temperature which can be achieved with a long but finite-time process
scales as a negative power of the process duration. In this article, we use our

 <dc:description>  What tweet features are associated with higher effectiveness in tweets?
Through the mining of 122 million engagements of 2.5 million original tweets,
we present a systematic review of tweet time, entities, composition, and user
account features. We show that the relationship between various features and
tweeting effectiveness is non-linear; for example, tweets that use a few
hashtags have higher effectiveness than using no or too many hashtags. This
research closely relates to various industrial applications that are based on
tweet features, including the analysis of advertising campaigns, the prediction
of user engagement, the extraction of signals for automated trading, etc.

 <dc:title>IoT-enabled Distributed Cyber-attacks on Transmission and Distribution
  Grids</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dvorkin, Yury</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Garg, Siddharth</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Internet of things (IoT) will make it possible to interconnect and
simultaneously control distributed electrical loads. Various technical and
regulatory concerns have been raised that IoT-operated loads are being deployed
without appropriately considering and systematically addressing potential
cyber-security challenges. Hence, one can envision a hypothetical scenario when
an ensemble of IoT-controlled loads can be hacked with malicious intentions of
compromising operations of the electrical grid. Under this scenario, the
attacker would use geographically distributed IoT-controlled loads to alternate
their net power injections into the electrical grid in such a way that may
disrupt normal grid operations.
  This paper presents a modeling framework to analyze grid impacts of
distributed cyber-attacks on IoT-controlled loads. This framework is used to
demonstrate how a hypothetical distributed cyber-attack propagates from the
distribution electrical grid, where IoT-controlled loads are expected to be
installed, to the transmission electrical grid. The techno-economic
interactions between the distribution and transmission electrical grids are
accounted for by means of bilevel optimization. The case study is carried out
on the modified versions of the 3-area IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) and
the IEEE 13-bus distribution feeder. Our numerical results demonstrate that the
severity of such attacks depends on the penetration level of IoT-controlled
loads and the strategy of the attacker.

 <dc:description>  The main goal of modeling human conversation is to create agents which can
interact with people in both open-ended and goal-oriented scenarios. End-to-end
trained neural dialog systems are an important line of research for such
generalized dialog models as they do not resort to any situation-specific
handcrafting of rules. However, incorporating personalization into such systems
is a largely unexplored topic as there are no existing corpora to facilitate
such work. In this paper, we present a new dataset of goal-oriented dialogs
which are influenced by speaker profiles attached to them. We analyze the
shortcomings of an existing end-to-end dialog system based on Memory Networks
and propose modifications to the architecture which enable personalization. We
also investigate personalization in dialog as a multi-task learning problem,
and show that a single model which shares features among various profiles
outperforms separate models for each profile.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, research has been done on applying Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs) as recommender systems. Results have been promising, especially in the
session-based setting where RNNs have been shown to outperform state-of-the-art
models. In many of these experiments, the RNN could potentially improve the
recommendations by utilizing information about the user's past sessions, in
addition to its own interactions in the current session. A problem for
session-based recommendation, is how to produce accurate recommendations at the
start of a session, before the system has learned much about the user's current
interests. We propose a novel approach that extends a RNN recommender to be
able to process the user's recent sessions, in order to improve
recommendations. This is done by using a second RNN to learn from recent
sessions, and predict the user's interest in the current session. By feeding
this information to the original RNN, it is able to improve its
recommendations. Our experiments on two different datasets show that the
proposed approach can significantly improve recommendations throughout the
sessions, compared to a single RNN working only on the current session. The
proposed model especially improves recommendations at the start of sessions,
and is therefore able to deal with the cold start problem within sessions.

 <dc:description>  In this report we present experimental results using
\emph{Haussdorf-Besicovich} fractal dimension for performing morphological
galaxy classification. The fractal dimension is a topological, structural and
spatial property that give us information about the space were an object lives.
We have calculated the fractal dimension value of the main types of galaxies:
ellipticals, spirals and irregulars; and we use it as a feature for classifying
them. Also, we have performed an image analysis process in order to standardize
the galaxy images, and we have used principal component analysis to obtain the
main attributes in the images. Galaxy classification was performed using
machine learning algorithms: C4.5, k-nearest neighbors, random forest and
support vector machines. Preliminary experimental results using 10-fold
cross-validation show that fractal dimension helps to improve classification,
with over 88 per cent accuracy for elliptical galaxies, 100 per cent accuracy
for spiral galaxies and over 40 per cent for irregular galaxies.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we initiate a rigorous theoretical study of clustering with
noisy queries (or a faulty oracle). Given a set of $n$ elements, our goal is to
recover the true clustering by asking minimum number of pairwise queries to an
oracle. Oracle can answer queries of the form : &quot;do elements $u$ and $v$ belong
to the same cluster?&quot; -- the queries can be asked interactively (adaptive
queries), or non-adaptively up-front, but its answer can be erroneous with
probability $p$. In this paper, we provide the first information theoretic
lower bound on the number of queries for clustering with noisy oracle in both
situations. We design novel algorithms that closely match this query complexity
lower bound, even when the number of clusters is unknown. Moreover, we design
computationally efficient algorithms both for the adaptive and non-adaptive
settings. The problem captures/generalizes multiple application scenarios. It
is directly motivated by the growing body of work that use crowdsourcing for
{\em entity resolution}, a fundamental and challenging data mining task aimed
to identify all records in a database referring to the same entity. Here crowd
represents the noisy oracle, and the number of queries directly relates to the
cost of crowdsourcing. Another application comes from the problem of {\em sign
edge prediction} in social network, where social interactions can be both
positive and negative, and one must identify the sign of all pair-wise
interactions by querying a few pairs. Furthermore, clustering with noisy oracle
is intimately connected to correlation clustering, leading to improvement
therein. Finally, it introduces a new direction of study in the popular {\em
stochastic block model} where one has an incomplete stochastic block model
matrix to recover the clusters.

 <dc:description>  Review-based recommender systems have gained noticeable ground in recent
years. In addition to the rating scores, those systems are enriched with
textual evaluations of items by the users. Neural language processing models,
on the other hand, have already found application in recommender systems,
mainly as a means of encoding user preference data, with the actual textual
description of items serving only as side information. In this paper, a novel
approach to incorporating the aforementioned models into the recommendation
process is presented. Initially, a neural language processing model and more
specifically the paragraph vector model is used to encode textual user reviews
of variable length into feature vectors of fixed length. Subsequently this
information is fused along with the rating scores in a probabilistic matrix
factorization algorithm, based on maximum a-posteriori estimation. The
resulting system, ParVecMF, is compared to a ratings' matrix factorization
approach on a reference dataset. The obtained preliminary results on a set of
two metrics are encouraging and may stimulate further research in this area.

 <dc:description>  Advances in image processing and computer vision in the latest years have
brought about the use of visual features in artwork recommendation. Recent
works have shown that visual features obtained from pre-trained deep neural
networks (DNNs) perform very well for recommending digital art. Other recent
works have shown that explicit visual features (EVF) based on attractiveness
can perform well in preference prediction tasks, but no previous work has
compared DNN features versus specific attractiveness-based visual features
(e.g. brightness, texture) in terms of recommendation performance. In this
work, we study and compare the performance of DNN and EVF features for the
purpose of physical artwork recommendation using transactional data from
UGallery, an online store of physical paintings. In addition, we perform an
exploratory analysis to understand if DNN embedded features have some relation
with certain EVF. Our results show that DNN features outperform EVF, that
certain EVF features are more suited for physical artwork recommendation and,
finally, we show evidence that certain neurons in the DNN might be partially
encoding visual features such as brightness, providing an opportunity for
explaining recommendations based on visual neural models.

 <dc:description>  Previous neural machine translation models used some heuristic search
algorithms (e.g., beam search) in order to avoid solving the maximum a
posteriori problem over translation sentences at test time. In this paper, we
propose the Gumbel-Greedy Decoding which trains a generative network to predict
translation under a trained model. We solve such a problem using the
Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization, which makes our generative network
differentiable and trainable through standard stochastic gradient methods. We
empirically demonstrate that our proposed model is effective for generating
sequences of discrete words.

 <dc:description>  In every form of digital store-and-forward communication, intermediate
forwarding nodes are computers, with attendant memory and processing resources.
This has inevitably given rise to efforts to create a wide area infrastructure
that goes beyond simple store and forward, a facility that makes more general
and varied use of the potential of this collection of increasingly powerful
nodes. Historically, efforts in this direction predate the advent of globally
routed packet networking. The desire for a converged infrastructure of this
kind has only intensified over the last 30 years, as memory, storage and
processing resources have both increased in density and speed and decreased in
cost. Although there seems to be a general consensus that it should be possible
to define and deploy such a dramatically more capable wide area facility, a
great deal of investment in research prototypes has yet to produce a credible
candidate architecture. Drawing on technical analysis, historical examples, and
case studies, we present a argument for the hypothesis that in order to realize
a distributed system with the kind of convergent generality and deployment
scalability that might qualify as &quot;future-defining,&quot; we must build it up from a
small set of simple, generic, and limited abstractions of the low level
processing, storage and network resources of its intermediate nodes.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a dominant machine
learning tool for a wide variety of application domains. However, training a
deep neural network requires a large amount of labeled data, which is an
expensive process in terms of time, labor and human expertise. Domain
adaptation or transfer learning algorithms address this challenge by leveraging
labeled data in a different, but related source domain, to develop a model for
the target domain. Further, the explosive growth of digital data has posed a
fundamental challenge concerning its storage and retrieval. Due to its storage
and retrieval efficiency, recent years have witnessed a wide application of
hashing in a variety of computer vision applications. In this paper, we first
introduce a new dataset, Office-Home, to evaluate domain adaptation algorithms.
The dataset contains images of a variety of everyday objects from multiple
domains. We then propose a novel deep learning framework that can exploit
labeled source data and unlabeled target data to learn informative hash codes,
to accurately classify unseen target data. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first research effort to exploit the feature learning capabilities of
deep neural networks to learn representative hash codes to address the domain
adaptation problem. Our extensive empirical studies on multiple transfer tasks
corroborate the usefulness of the framework in learning efficient hash codes
which outperform existing competitive baselines for unsupervised domain
adaptation.

 <dc:description>  We consider a mobile edge computing problem, in which mobile users offload
their computation tasks to computing nodes (e.g., base stations) at the network
edge. The edge nodes compute the requested functions and communicate the
computed results to the users via wireless links. For this problem, we propose
a Universal Coded Edge Computing (UCEC) scheme for linear functions to
simultaneously minimize the load of computation at the edge nodes, and maximize
the physical-layer communication efficiency towards the mobile users. In the
proposed UCEC scheme, edge nodes create coded inputs of the users, from which
they compute coded output results. Then, the edge nodes utilize the computed
coded results to create communication messages that zero-force all the
interference signals over the air at each user. Specifically, the proposed
scheme is universal since the coded computations performed at the edge nodes
are oblivious of the channel states during the communication process from the
edge nodes to the users.

trained on one data distribution to different data distributions. In this

by combining domain alignment along with similarity-based embedding. We also

algorithm using the source data. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple vision
datasets demonstrate that the NET algorithm outperforms existing competitive
procedures for unsupervised DA.

domain by sampling relevant data points from the source and combining it with
the target data. We present a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based supervised DA
technique, where the similarity between source and target domains is modeled as
the similarity between their SVM decision boundaries. We couple the source and
target SVMs and reduce the model to a standard single SVM. We test the
Coupled-SVM on multiple datasets and compare our results with other popular SVM

 <dc:description>  Domain adaptation deals with adapting classifiers trained on data from a
source distribution, to work effectively on data from a target distribution. In
this paper, we introduce the Nonlinear Embedding Transform (NET) for
unsupervised domain adaptation. The NET reduces cross-domain disparity through
nonlinear domain alignment. It also embeds the domain-aligned data such that
similar data points are clustered together. This results in enhanced
classification. To determine the parameters in the NET model (and in other
unsupervised domain adaptation models), we introduce a validation procedure by
sampling source data points that are similar in distribution to the target
data. We test the NET and the validation procedure using popular image datasets
and compare the classification results across competitive procedures for
unsupervised domain adaptation.

 <dc:description>  Non-binary (NB) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are graph-based codes
that are increasingly being considered as a powerful error correction tool for
modern dense storage devices. The increasing levels of asymmetry incorporated
by the channels underlying modern dense storage systems exacerbates the error
floor problem. In a recent research, the weight consistency matrix (WCM)
framework was introduced as an effective NB-LDPC code optimization methodology
that is suitable for modern Flash memory and magnetic recording (MR) systems.
In this paper, we provide the in-depth theoretical analysis needed to
understand and properly apply the WCM framework. We focus on general absorbing
sets of type two (GASTs). In particular, we introduce a novel tree
representation of a GAST called the unlabeled GAST tree, using which we prove
that the WCM framework is optimal. Then, we enumerate the WCMs. We demonstrate
the significance of the savings achieved by the WCM framework in the number of
matrices processed to remove a GAST. Moreover, we provide a linear-algebraic
analysis of the null spaces of WCMs associated with a GAST. We derive the
minimum number of edge weight changes needed to remove a GAST via its WCMs,
along with how to choose these changes. Additionally, we propose a new set of
problematic objects, namely the oscillating sets of type two (OSTs), which
contribute to the error floor of NB-LDPC codes with even column weights on
asymmetric channels, and we show how to customize the WCM framework to remove
OSTs. We also extend the domain of the WCM framework applications by
demonstrating its benefits in optimizing column weight 5 codes, codes used over
Flash channels with soft information, and spatially-coupled codes. The
performance gains achieved via the WCM framework range between 1 and nearly 2.5
orders of magnitude in the error floor region over interesting channels.

 <dc:description>  The emergence of depth imaging technologies like the Microsoft Kinect has
renewed interest in computational methods for gesture classification based on
videos. For several years now, researchers have used the Bag-of-Features (BoF)
as a primary method for generation of feature vectors from video data for
recognition of gestures. However, the BoF method is a coarse representation of
the information in a video, which often leads to poor similarity measures
between videos. Besides, when features extracted from different spatio-temporal
locations in the video are pooled to create histogram vectors in the BoF
method, there is an intrinsic loss of their original locations in space and
time. In this paper, we propose a new Multiresolution Match Kernel (MMK) for
video classification, which can be considered as a generalization of the BoF
method. We apply this procedure to hand gesture classification based on RGB-D
videos of the American Sign Language(ASL) hand gestures and our results show
promise and usefulness of this new method.

 <dc:description>  Modern dense Flash memory devices operate at very low error rates, which
require powerful error correcting coding (ECC) techniques. An emerging class of
graph-based ECC techniques that has broad applications is the class of
spatially-coupled (SC) codes, where a block code is partitioned into components
that are then rewired multiple times to construct an SC code. Here, our focus
is on SC codes with the underlying circulant-based structure. In this paper, we
present a three-stage approach for the design of high performance non-binary SC
(NB-SC) codes optimized for practical Flash channels; we aim at minimizing the
number of detrimental general absorbing sets of type two (GASTs) in the graph
of the designed NB-SC code. In the first stage, we deploy a novel partitioning
mechanism, called the optimal overlap partitioning, which acts on the
protograph of the SC code to produce optimal partitioning corresponding to the
smallest number of detrimental objects. In the second stage, we apply a new
circulant power optimizer to further reduce the number of detrimental GASTs. In
the third stage, we use the weight consistency matrix framework to manipulate
edge weights to eliminate as many as possible of the GASTs that remain in the
NB-SC code after the first two stages (that operate on the unlabeled graph of
the code). Simulation results reveal that NB-SC codes designed using our
approach outperform state-of-the-art NB-SC codes when used over Flash channels.

 <dc:description>  Modeling the spread of infections on networks is a well-studied and important
field of research. Most infection and diffusion models require a real value or
probability on the edges of the network as an input, but this is rarely
available in real-life applications. Our goal in this paper is to develop a
general framework for this task. The general model works with the most widely
used infection models and is able to handle an arbitrary number of observations
on such processes. The model is defined as a general optimization task and a
Particle Swarm heuristic is proposed to solve it. We evaluate the accuracy and
speed of the proposed method on a high variety of realistic infection
scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Mutual Information (MI) is often used for feature selection when developing
classifier models. Estimating the MI for a subset of features is often
intractable. We demonstrate, that under the assumptions of conditional
independence, MI between a subset of features can be expressed as the
Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) between pairs of features. But selecting
features with the highest CMI turns out to be a hard combinatorial problem. In
this work, we have applied two unique global methods, Truncated Power Method
(TPower) and Low Rank Bilinear Approximation (LowRank), to solve the feature
selection problem. These algorithms provide very good approximations to the
NP-hard CMI based feature selection problem. We experimentally demonstrate the
effectiveness of these procedures across multiple datasets and compare them
with existing MI based global and iterative feature selection procedures.

 <dc:description>  Extensive efforts have been devoted to recognizing facial action units (AUs).
However, it is still challenging to recognize AUs from spontaneous facial
displays especially when they are accompanied with speech. Different from all
prior work that utilized visual observations for facial AU recognition, this
paper presents a novel approach that recognizes speech-related AUs exclusively
from audio signals based on the fact that facial activities are highly
correlated with voice during speech. Specifically, dynamic and physiological
relationships between AUs and phonemes are modeled through a continuous time
Bayesian network (CTBN); then AU recognition is performed by probabilistic
inference via the CTBN model.
  A pilot audiovisual AU-coded database has been constructed to evaluate the
proposed audio-based AU recognition framework. The database consists of a
&quot;clean&quot; subset with frontal and neutral faces and a challenging subset
collected with large head movements and occlusions. Experimental results on
this database show that the proposed CTBN model achieves promising recognition
performance for 7 speech-related AUs and outperforms the state-of-the-art
visual-based methods especially for those AUs that are activated at low
intensities or &quot;hardly visible&quot; in the visual channel. Furthermore, the CTBN
model yields more impressive recognition performance on the challenging subset,
where the visual-based approaches suffer significantly.

 <dc:title>Simultaneous Transmit and Receive Operation in Next Generation IEEE
  802.11 WLANs: A MAC Protocol Design Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Full-duplex (FD) technology is likely to be adopted in various legacy
communications standards. The IEEE 802.11ax working group has been considering
a simultaneous transmit and receive (STR) mode for the next generation wireless
local area networks (WLANs). Enabling STR mode (FD communication mode) in
802.11 networks creates bi-directional FD (BFD) and uni-directional FD (UFD)
links. The key challenge is to integrate STR mode with minimal protocol
modifications, while considering the co-existence of FD and legacy half-duplex
(HD) stations (STAs) and backwards compatibility. This paper proposes a simple
and practical approach to enable STR mode in 802.11 networks with co-existing
FD and HD STAs. The protocol explicitly accounts for the peculiarities of FD
environments and backwards compatibility. Key aspects of the proposed solution
include FD capability discovery, handshake mechanism for channel access, node
selection for UFD transmission, adaptive acknowledgement (ACK) timeout for STAs
engaged in BFD or UFD transmission, and mitigation of contention unfairness.
Performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed solution
in realizing the gains of FD technology for next generation WLANs.

 <dc:description>  This letter studies a radio-frequency (RF) multi-user wireless power transfer
(WPT) system, where an energy transmitter (ET) with a large number of antennas
delivers energy wirelessly to multiple distributed energy receivers (ERs). We
investigate a low-complexity WPT scheme based on the retrodirective beamforming
technique, where all ERs send a common beacon signal simultaneously to the ET
in the uplink and the ET simply conjugates and amplifies its received
sum-signal and transmits to all ERs in the downlink for WPT. We show that such
a low-complexity scheme achieves the massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) energy beamforming gain. However, a &quot;doubly near-far&quot; issue exists due
to the round-trip (uplink beacon and downlink WPT) signal propagation loss
where the harvested power of a far ER from the ET can be significantly lower
than that of a near ER if the same uplink beacon power is used. To tackle this
problem, we propose a distributed uplink beacon power update algorithm, where
each ER independently adjusts the beacon power based on its current harvested
power in an iterative manner. It is shown that the proposed algorithm converges
quickly to a unique fixed-point solution, which helps achieve the desired user
fairness with best efforts.

 <dc:description>  In large part, rodents see the world through their whiskers, a powerful
tactile sense enabled by a series of brain areas that form the
whisker-trigeminal system. Raw sensory data arrives in the form of mechanical
input to the exquisitely sensitive, actively-controllable whisker array, and is
processed through a sequence of neural circuits, eventually arriving in
cortical regions that communicate with decision-making and memory areas.
Although a long history of experimental studies has characterized many aspects
of these processing stages, the computational operations of the
whisker-trigeminal system remain largely unknown. In the present work, we take
a goal-driven deep neural network (DNN) approach to modeling these
computations. First, we construct a biophysically-realistic model of the rat
whisker array. We then generate a large dataset of whisker sweeps across a wide
variety of 3D objects in highly-varying poses, angles, and speeds. Next, we
train DNNs from several distinct architectural families to solve a shape
recognition task in this dataset. Each architectural family represents a
structurally-distinct hypothesis for processing in the whisker-trigeminal
system, corresponding to different ways in which spatial and temporal
information can be integrated. We find that most networks perform poorly on the
challenging shape recognition task, but that specific architectures from
several families can achieve reasonable performance levels. Finally, we show
that Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs), a tool for comparing
population codes between neural systems, can separate these higher-performing
networks with data of a type that could plausibly be collected in a
neurophysiological or imaging experiment. Our results are a proof-of-concept
that goal-driven DNN networks of the whisker-trigeminal system are potentially
within reach.

 <dc:description>  As platform ecosystems are growing by platform users' data, the importance of
data governance has been highlighted. In particular, how to share control and
decision rights with platform users are regarded as significant design issues
since the role of them is increasing. Platform context should be considered
when designing data governance in platform ecosystems (i.e.
centralized/decentralized governance). However, there is limited research on
this issue. Existing models focus on characteristics for enterprises. This
results in limited support for platform ecosystems where there are different
types of business context such as open strategies or platform maturity. This
paper develops a contingency model for platform ecosystems including
distinctive contingency factors. The study then discusses which data governance
factors should be carefully considered and strengthened for each contingency in
order to succeed in governance and to win market. A case study is performed to
validate our model and to show its practical implications.

 <dc:description>  Existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are either based on
general-purpose and domain-agnostic schemes which can lead to slow convergence,
or hand-crafting of problem-specific proposals by an expert. We propose
A-NICE-MC, a novel method to train flexible parametric Markov chain kernels to
produce samples with desired properties. First, we propose an efficient
likelihood-free adversarial training method to train a Markov chain and mimic a
given data distribution. Then, we leverage flexible volume preserving flows to
obtain parametric kernels for MCMC. Using a bootstrap approach, we show how to
train efficient Markov chains to sample from a prescribed posterior
distribution by iteratively improving the quality of both the model and the
samples. A-NICE-MC provides the first framework to automatically design
efficient domain-specific MCMC proposals. Empirical results demonstrate that
A-NICE-MC combines the strong guarantees of MCMC with the expressiveness of
deep neural networks, and is able to significantly outperform competing methods
such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

 <dc:description>  Deep embeddings answer one simple question: How similar are two images?
Learning these embeddings is the bedrock of verification, zero-shot learning,
and visual search. The most prominent approaches optimize a deep convolutional
network with a suitable loss function, such as contrastive loss or triplet
loss. While a rich line of work focuses solely on the loss functions, we show
in this paper that selecting training examples plays an equally important role.
We propose distance weighted sampling, which selects more informative and
stable examples than traditional approaches. In addition, we show that a simple
margin based loss is sufficient to outperform all other loss functions. We
evaluate our approach on the Stanford Online Products, CAR196, and the
CUB200-2011 datasets for image retrieval and clustering, and on the LFW dataset
for face verification. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on all
of them.

 <dc:description>  This work addresses the challenge of allowing simultaneous and predictable
accesses to shared data on multi-core systems. We accomplish this by proposing
a predictable cache coherence protocol, which mandates the use of certain
invariants to ensure predictability. In particular, we enforce these invariants
by augmenting the classic modify-share-invalid (MSI) protocol with transient
coherence states, and minimal architectural changes. This allows us to derive
worst-case latency bounds on predictable MSI (PMSI) protocol. Our analysis
shows that while the arbitration latency scales linearly, the coherence latency
scales quadratically with the number of cores. We implement PMSI in gem5, and
execute SPLASH-2 and synthetic multi-threaded workloads. Our empirical results
show that our approach is always within the analytical worst-case latency
bounds, and that PMSI improves average-case performance by up to 4x over the
next best predictable alternative. PMSI has average slowdowns of 1.45x and
1.46x compared to conventional MSI and MESI protocols, respectively.

 <dc:description>  The GFR (Gabor Filter Residual) features, built as histograms of quantized
residuals obtained with 2D Gabor filters, can achieve competitive detection
performance against adaptive JPEG steganography. In this paper, an improved
version of the GFR is proposed. First, a novel histogram merging method is
proposed according to the symmetries between different Gabor filters, thus
making the features more compact and robust. Second, a new weighted histogram
method is proposed by considering the position of the residual value in a
quantization interval, making the features more sensitive to the slight changes
in residual values. The experiments are given to demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed methods. Finally, we design a CNN to duplicate the detector
with the improved GFR features and the ensemble classifier, thus optimizing the
design of the filters used to form residuals in JPEG-phase-aware features.

 <dc:title>Fundamental Limits of Universal Variable-to-Fixed Length Coding of

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Universal variable-to-fixed (V-F) length coding of $d$-dimensional
exponential family of distributions is considered. We propose an achievable
scheme consisting of a dictionary, used to parse the source output stream,
making use of the previously-introduced notion of quantized types. The
quantized type class of a sequence is based on partitioning the space of
minimal sufficient statistics into cuboids. Our proposed dictionary consists of
sequences in the boundaries of transition from low to high quantized type class
size. We derive the asymptotics of the $\epsilon$-coding rate of our coding
scheme for large enough dictionaries. In particular, we show that the
third-order coding rate of our scheme is $H\frac{d}{2}\frac{\log\log M}{\log
M}$, where $H$ is the entropy of the source and $M$ is the dictionary size. We
further provide a converse, showing that this rate is optimal up to the
third-order term.

 <dc:description>  Understanding the 3D structure of a scene is of vital importance, when it
comes to developing fully autonomous robots. To this end, we present a novel
deep learning based framework that estimates depth, surface normals and surface
curvature by only using a single RGB image. To the best of our knowledge this
is the first work to estimate surface curvature from colour using a machine
learning approach. Additionally, we demonstrate that by tuning the network to
infer well designed features, such as surface curvature, we can achieve
improved performance at estimating depth and normals.This indicates that
network guidance is still a useful aspect of designing and training a neural
network. We run extensive experiments where the network is trained to infer
different tasks while the model capacity is kept constant resulting in
different feature maps based on the tasks at hand. We outperform the previous
state-of-the-art benchmarks which jointly estimate depths and surface normals
while predicting surface curvature in parallel.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Human-machine networks pervade much of contemporary life. Network change is
the product of structural modifications along with differences in participant
be-havior. If we assume that behavioural change in a human-machine network is
the result of changing the attitudes of participants in the network, then the
question arises whether network structure can affect participant attitude.
Taking citizen par-ticipation as an example, engagement with relevant
stakeholders reveals trust and motivation to be the major objectives for the
network. Using a typology to de-scribe network state based on multiple
characteristic or dimensions, we can pre-dict possible behavioural outcomes in
the network. However, this has to be medi-ated via attitude change. Motivation
for the citizen participation network can only increase in line with enhanced
trust. The focus for changing network dynamics, therefore, shifts to the
dimensional changes needed to encourage increased trust. It turns out that the
coordinated manipulation of multiple dimensions is needed to bring about the
desired shift in attitude.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have seen the Internet become a key vehicle for citizens around
the globe to express political opinions and organize protests. This fact has
not gone unnoticed, with countries around the world repurposing network
management tools (e.g., URL filtering products) and protocols (e.g., BGP, DNS)
for censorship. However, repurposing these products can have unintended
international impact, which we refer to as &quot;censorship leakage&quot;. While there
have been anecdotal reports of censorship leakage, there has yet to be a
systematic study of censorship leakage at a global scale. In this paper, we
combine a global censorship measurement platform (ICLab) with a general-purpose
technique -- boolean network tomography -- to identify which AS on a network
path is performing censorship. At a high-level, our approach exploits BGP churn
to narrow down the set of potential censoring ASes by over 95%. We exactly
identify 65 censoring ASes and find that the anomalies introduced by 24 of the
65 censoring ASes have an impact on users located in regions outside the
jurisdiction of the censoring AS, resulting in the leaking of regional
censorship policies.

 <dc:description>  This study deals with content-based musical playlists generation focused on
Songs and Instrumentals. Automatic playlist generation relies on collaborative
filtering and autotagging algorithms. Autotagging can solve the cold start
issue and popularity bias that are critical in music recommender systems.
However, autotagging remains to be improved and cannot generate satisfying
music playlists. In this paper, we suggest improvements toward better
autotagging-generated playlists compared to state-of-the-art. To assess our
method, we focus on the Song and Instrumental tags. Song and Instrumental are
two objective and opposite tags that are under-studied compared to genres or
moods, which are subjective and multi-modal tags. In this paper, we consider an
industrial real-world musical database that is unevenly distributed between
Songs and Instrumentals and bigger than databases used in previous studies. We
set up three incremental experiments to enhance automatic playlist generation.
Our suggested approach generates an Instrumental playlist with up to three
times less false positives than cutting edge methods. Moreover, we provide a
design of experiment framework to foster research on Songs and Instrumentals.
We give insight on how to improve further the quality of generated playlists
and to extend our methods to other musical tags. Furthermore, we provide the
source code to guarantee reproducible research.

 <dc:description>  Social bots are currently regarded an influential but also somewhat
mysterious factor in public discourse and opinion making. They are considered
to be capable of massively distributing propaganda in social and online media
and their application is even suspected to be partly responsible for recent
election results. Astonishingly, the term `Social Bot' is not well defined and
different scientific disciplines use divergent definitions. This work starts
with a balanced definition attempt, before providing an overview of how social
bots actually work (taking the example of Twitter) and what their current
technical limitations are. Despite recent research progress in Deep Learning
and Big Data, there are many activities bots cannot handle well. We then
discuss how bot capabilities can be extended and controlled by integrating
humans into the process and reason that this is currently the most promising
way to go in order to realize effective interactions with other humans.

embedding, in order to leverage both product content information, such as
textual descriptions and images, and product collaborative filtering signal. By
introducing the fusion step at the very end of our architecture, we are able to
train each modality separately, allowing us to keep a modular architecture that
is preferable in real-world recommendation deployments. We analyze our
performance on normal and hard recommendation setups such as cold-start and
cross-category recommendations and achieve good performance on a large product

 <dc:description>  A Fog radio access network is considered as a network architecture candidate
to meet the soaring demand in terms of reliability, spectral efficiency, and
latency in next generation wireless networks. This architecture combines the
benefits associated with centralized cloud processing and wireless edge caching
enabling primarily low-latency transmission under moderate fronthaul capacity
requirements. The F-RAN we consider in this paper is composed of a centralized
cloud server which is connected through fronthaul links to two edge nodes
serving two mobile users through a Z-shaped partially connected wireless
network. We define an information-theoretic metric, the delivery time per bit
(DTB), that captures the worst-case per-bit delivery latency for conveying any
requested content to the users. For the cases when cloud and wireless
transmission occur either sequentially or in parallel, we establish coinciding
lower and upper bounds on the DTB as a function of cache size, backhaul
capacity and wireless channel parameters. Through optimized rate allocation,
our achievability scheme determines the best combination of private, common
signalling and interference neutralization that matches the converse. Our
converse bounds use subsets of wireless, fronthaul and caching resources of the
F-RAN as side information that enable a single receiver to decode either one or
both users' requested files. We show the optimality on the DTB for all channel
regimes. In case of serial transmission, the functional DTB-behavior changes at
fronthaul capacity thresholds. In this context, we combine multiple channel
regimes to classes of channel regimes which share the same fronthaul capacity
thresholds and as such the same DTB-functional. In total, our analysis
identifies four classes; in only three of those edge caching and cloud
processing can provide nontrivial synergestic and non-synergestic performance
gains.

 <dc:description>  Big data has shown its uniquely powerful ability to reveal, model, and
understand driver behaviors. The amount of data affects the experiment cost and
conclusions in the analysis. Insufficient data may lead to inaccurate models
while excessive data waste resources. For projects that cost millions of
dollars, it is critical to determine the right amount of data needed. However,
how to decide the appropriate amount has not been fully studied in the realm of
driver behaviors. This paper systematically investigates this issue to estimate
how much naturalistic driving data (NDD) is needed for understanding driver
behaviors from a statistical point of view. A general assessment method is
proposed using a Gaussian kernel density estimation to catch the underlying
characteristics of driver behaviors. We then apply the Kullback-Liebler
divergence method to measure the similarity between density functions with
differing amounts of NDD. A max-minimum approach is used to compute the
appropriate amount of NDD. To validate our proposed method, we investigated the
car-following case using NDD collected from the University of Michigan Safety
Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) program. We demonstrate that from a statistical
perspective, the proposed approach can provide an appropriate amount of NDD
capable of capturing most features of the normal car-following behavior, which
is consistent with the experiment settings in many literatures.

 <dc:title>Causal Embeddings for Recommendation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many current applications use recommendations in order to modify the natural
user behavior, such as to increase the number of sales or the time spent on a
website. This results in a gap between the final recommendation objective and
the classical setup where recommendation candidates are evaluated by their
coherence with past user behavior, by predicting either the missing entries in
the user-item matrix, or the most likely next event. To bridge this gap, we
optimize a recommendation policy for the task of increasing the desired outcome
versus the organic user behavior. We show this is equivalent to learning to
predict recommendation outcomes under a fully random recommendation policy. To
this end, we propose a new domain adaptation algorithm that learns from logged
data containing outcomes from a biased recommendation policy and predicts
recommendation outcomes according to random exposure. We compare our method
against state-of-the-art factorization methods and new approaches of causal
recommendation and show significant improvements.

 <dc:title>A Variance Maximization Criterion for Active Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Active learning aims to train a classifier as fast as possible with as few
labels as possible. The core element in virtually any active learning strategy
is the criterion that measures the usefulness of the unlabeled data. We propose
a novel approach which we refer to as maximizing variance for active learning
or MVAL for short. MVAL measures the value of unlabeled instances by evaluating
the rate of change of output variables caused by changes in the next sample to
be queried and its potential labelling. In a sense, this criterion measures how
unstable the classifier's output is for the unlabeled data points under
perturbations of the training data. MVAL maintains, what we will refer to as,
retraining information matrices to keep track of these output scores and
exploits two kinds of variance to measure the informativeness and
representativeness, respectively. By fusing these variances, MVAL is able to
select the instances which are both informative and representative. We employ
our technique both in combination with logistic regression and support vector
machines and demonstrate that MVAL achieves state-of-the-art performance in
experiments on a large number of standard benchmark datasets.

 <dc:description>  Climate change, vaccination, abortion, Trump: Many topics are surrounded by
fierce controversies. The nature of such heated debates and their elements have
been studied extensively in the social science literature. More recently,
various computational approaches to controversy analysis have appeared, using
new data sources such as Wikipedia, which help us now better understand these
phenomena. However, compared to what social sciences have discovered about such
debates, the existing computational approaches mostly focus on just a few of
the many important aspects around the concept of controversies. In order to
link the two strands, we provide and evaluate here a controversy model that is
both, rooted in the findings of the social science literature and at the same
time strongly linked to computational methods. We show how this model can lead
to computational controversy analytics that have full coverage over all the
crucial aspects that make up a controversy.

 <dc:description>  Patient-specific cranial implants are important and necessary in the surgery
of cranial defect restoration. However, traditional methods of manual design of
cranial implants are complicated and time-consuming. Our purpose is to develop
a novel software named EasyCrania to design the cranial implants conveniently
and efficiently. The process can be divided into five steps, which are
mirroring model, clipping surface, surface fitting, the generation of the
initial implant and the generation of the final implant. The main concept of
our method is to use the geometry information of the mirrored model as the base
to generate the final implant. The comparative studies demonstrated that the
EasyCrania can improve the efficiency of cranial implant design significantly.
And, the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the software were stable, which
were 87.07+/-1.6% and 87.73+/-1.4% respectively.

 <dc:description>  This work explores the query complexity of property testing for general
piecewise functions on the real line, in the active and passive property
testing settings. The results are proven under an abstract zero-measure
crossings condition, which has as special cases piecewise constant functions
and piecewise polynomial functions. We find that, in the active testing
setting, the query complexity of testing general piecewise functions is
independent of the number of pieces. We also identify the optimal dependence on
the number of pieces in the query complexity of passive testing in the special
case of piecewise constant functions.

 <dc:description>  With advanced data analytical techniques, efforts for more accurate decision
support systems for disease prediction are on rise. Surveys by World Health
Organization (WHO) indicate a great increase in number of diabetic patients and
related deaths each year. Early diagnosis of diabetes is a major concern among
researchers and practitioners. The paper presents an application of
\textit{Automatic Multilayer Perceptron }which\textit{ }is combined with an
outlier detection method \textit{Enhanced Class Outlier Detection using
distance based algorithm }to create a prediction framework named as Enhanced
Class Outlier with Automatic Multi layer Perceptron (ECO-AMLP). A series of
experiments are performed on publicly available Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset to
compare ECO-AMLP with other individual classifiers as well as ensemble based
methods. The outlier technique used in our framework gave better results as
compared to other pre-processing and classification techniques. Finally, the
results are compared with other state-of-the-art methods reported in literature
for diabetes prediction on PIDD and achieved accuracy of 88.7\% bests all other
reported studies.

 <dc:description>  Abnormal crowd behaviour detection attracts a large interest due to its
importance in video surveillance scenarios. However, the ambiguity and the lack
of sufficient &quot;abnormal&quot; ground truth data makes end-to-end training of large
deep networks hard in this domain. In this paper we propose to use Generative
Adversarial Nets (GANs), which are trained to generate only the &quot;normal&quot;
distribution of the data. During the adversarial GAN training, a discriminator
&quot;D&quot; is used as a supervisor for the generator network &quot;G&quot; and vice versa. At
testing time we use &quot;D&quot; to solve our discriminative task (abnormality
detection), where &quot;D&quot; has been trained without the need of manually-annotated
abnormal data. Moreover, in order to prevent &quot;G&quot; learn a trivial identity
function, we use a cross-channel approach, forcing &quot;G&quot; to transform raw-pixel
data in motion information and vice versa. The quantitative results on standard
benchmarks show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods
in both the frame-level and the pixel-level evaluation.

 <dc:title>Contextual Sequence Modeling for Recommendation with Recurrent Neural

 <dc:creator>Smirnova, Elena</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recommendations can greatly benefit from good representations of the user
state at recommendation time. Recent approaches that leverage Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs) for session-based recommendations have shown that Deep Learning
models can provide useful user representations for recommendation. However,
current RNN modeling approaches summarize the user state by only taking into
account the sequence of items that the user has interacted with in the past,
without taking into account other essential types of context information such
as the associated types of user-item interactions, the time gaps between events
and the time of day for each interaction. To address this, we propose a new
class of Contextual Recurrent Neural Networks for Recommendation (CRNNs) that
can take into account the contextual information both in the input and output
layers and modifying the behavior of the RNN by combining the context embedding
with the item embedding and more explicitly, in the model dynamics, by
parametrizing the hidden unit transitions as a function of context information.
We compare our CRNNs approach with RNNs and non-sequential baselines and show
good improvements on the next event prediction task.

 <dc:description>  To model deformation of anatomical shapes, non-linear statistics are required
to take into account the non-linear structure of the data space. Computer
implementations of non-linear statistics and differential geometry algorithms
often lead to long and complex code sequences. The aim of the paper is to show
how the Theano framework can be used for simple and concise implementation of
complex differential geometry algorithms while being able to handle complex and
high-dimensional data structures. We show how the Theano framework meets both
of these requirements. The framework provides a symbolic language that allows
mathematical equations to be directly translated into Theano code, and it is
able to perform both fast CPU and GPU computations on high-dimensional data. We
show how different concepts from non-linear statistics and differential
geometry can be implemented in Theano, and give examples of the implemented
theory visualized on landmark representations of Corpus Callosum shapes.

 <dc:description>  Many reasons make NFV an attractive paradigm for IT security: lowers costs,
agile operations and better isolation as well as fast security updates,
improved incident responses and better level of automation. On the other side,
the network threats tend to be increasingly complex and distributed, implying
huge traffic scale to be monitored and increasingly strict mitigation delay
requirements. Considering the current trend of the net- working and the
requirements to counteract to the evolution of cyber-threats, it is expected
that also network monitoring will move towards NFV based solutions. In this
paper, we present D- StreaMon an NFV-capable distributed framework for network
monitoring realized to face the above described challenges. It relies on the
StreaMon platform, a solution for network monitoring originally designed for
traditional middleboxes. An evolution path which migrates StreaMon from
middleboxes to Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) has been realized.

 <dc:description>  A fundamental question for edge detection in noisy images is how faint can an
edge be and still be detected. In this paper we offer a formalism to study this
question and subsequently introduce computationally efficient multiscale edge
detection algorithms designed to detect faint edges in noisy images. In our
formalism we view edge detection as a search in a discrete, though potentially
large, set of feasible curves. First, we derive approximate expressions for the
detection threshold as a function of curve length and the complexity of the
search space. We then present two edge detection algorithms, one for straight
edges, and the second for curved ones. Both algorithms efficiently search for
edges in a large set of candidates by hierarchically constructing difference
filters that match the curves traced by the sought edges. We demonstrate the
utility of our algorithms in both simulations and applications involving
challenging real images. Finally, based on these principles, we develop an
algorithm for fiber detection and enhancement. We exemplify its utility to
reveal and enhance nerve axons in light microscopy images.

pair-wise queries of the form, &quot;do two elements $u$ and $v$ belong to the same
cluster?&quot;. The goal is to recover the optimum clustering by asking the minimum
number of queries. In this paper, we initiate a rigorous theoretical study of
this basic problem of query complexity of interactive clustering, and provide
strong information theoretic lower bounds, as well as nearly matching upper
bounds. Most clustering problems come with a similarity matrix, which is used
by an automated process to cluster similar points together. Our main
contribution in this paper is to show the dramatic power of side information
aka similarity matrix on reducing the query complexity of clustering. A
similarity matrix represents noisy pair-wise relationships such as one computed
by some function on attributes of the elements. A natural noisy model is where
similarity values are drawn independently from some arbitrary probability
distribution $f_+$ when the underlying pair of elements belong to the same
cluster, and from some $f_-$ otherwise. We show that given such a similarity
matrix, the query complexity reduces drastically from $\Theta(nk)$ (no
similarity matrix) to $O(\frac{k^2\log{n}}{\cH^2(f_+\|f_-)})$ where $\cH^2$
denotes the squared Hellinger divergence. Moreover, this is also
information-theoretic optimal within an $O(\log{n})$ factor. Our algorithms are
all efficient, and parameter free, i.e., they work without any knowledge of $k,
f_+$ and $f_-$, and only depend logarithmically with $n$. Along the way, our
work also reveals intriguing connection to popular community detection models
such as the {\em stochastic block model}, significantly generalizes them, and
opens up many venues for interesting future research.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the maximum coding rate achievable on a two-user broadcast
channel for the case where a common message is transmitted with feedback using
either fixed-blocklength codes or variable-length codes. For the
fixed-blocklength-code setup, we establish nonasymptotic converse and
achievability bounds. An asymptotic analysis of these bounds reveals that
feedback improves the second-order term compared to the no-feedback case. In
particular, for a certain class of anti-symmetric broadcast channels, we show
that the dispersion is halved. For the variable-length-code setup, we
demonstrate that the channel dispersion is zero.

 <dc:title>Information Diffusion in Social Networks in Two Phases</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of maximizing information diffusion, given a certain budget
expressed in terms of the number of seed nodes, is an important topic in social
networks research. Existing literature focuses on single phase diffusion where
all seed nodes are selected at the beginning of diffusion and all the selected
nodes are activated simultaneously. This paper undertakes a detailed
investigation of the effect of selecting and activating seed nodes in multiple
phases. Specifically, we study diffusion in two phases assuming the
well-studied independent cascade model. First, we formulate an objective
function for two-phase diffusion, investigate its properties, and propose
efficient algorithms for finding seed nodes in the two phases. Next, we study
two associated problems: (1) budget splitting which seeks to optimally split
the total budget between the two phases and (2) scheduling which seeks to
determine an optimal delay after which to commence the second phase. Our main
conclusions include: (a) under strict temporal constraints, use single phase
diffusion, (b) under moderate temporal constraints, use two-phase diffusion
with a short delay while allocating most of the budget to the first phase, and
(c) when there are no temporal constraints, use two-phase diffusion with a long
delay while allocating roughly one-third of the budget to the first phase.

 <dc:title>An Analytical Approach to Computing Blocking Probabilities in Flexi-Grid
  Optical Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Singh, Sandeep Kumar</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Due to the analytical complexity of routing and spectrum allocation policies
-- random-fit and first-fit, in flexi-grid optical networks, it is necessary to
analyze the approximate blocking probabilities. To this end, we present a novel
model for reduced link state occupancy, whereby each state of a Markov chain
represents the total occupied spectrum slices in a flexi-grid optical link.
Using the independence link model, we further develop a method to calculate
state-dependent per-class connection setup rates in multi-class flexi-grid
optical networks. To alleviate the spectrum fragmentation problem, we extend
the analysis with a defragmentation process as a reactive connection
reconfiguration scheme, taking into account the probability of observing a link
being in a fragmentation state, and show that a reactive defragmentation
process can indeed reduce blocking considerably. We show that the
defragmentation process is most effective under the medium load condition as
analysed in a large scale flexi-grid optical networks. Through various
numerical and simulation results we show that our model, with or without
defragmentation, can be efficiently used to calculate accurate blocking
probabilities in multi-class flexi-grid optical networks, as the approximate
results match closely with the exact and simulation results under different
scenarios, including varying link capacities, classes of demands, and traffic
loads.

 <dc:description>  Security exploits can include cyber threats such as computer programs that
can disturb the normal behavior of computer systems (viruses), unsolicited
e-mail (spam), malicious software (malware), monitoring software (spyware),
attempting to make computer resources unavailable to their intended users
(Distributed Denial-of-Service or DDoS attack), the social engineering, and
online identity theft (phishing). One such cyber threat, which is particularly
dangerous to computer users is phishing. Phishing is well known as online
identity theft, which targets to steal victims' sensitive information such as
username, password and online banking details. This paper focuses on designing
an innovative and gamified approach to educate individuals about phishing
attacks. The study asks how one can integrate self-efficacy, which has a
co-relation with the user's knowledge, into an anti-phishing educational game
to thwart phishing attacks? One of the main reasons would appear to be a lack
of user knowledge to prevent from phishing attacks. Therefore, this research
investigates the elements that influence (in this case, either conceptual or
procedural knowledge or their interaction effect) and then integrate them into
an anti-phishing educational game to enhance people's phishing prevention
behaviour through their motivation.

 <dc:description>  Reactive molecular dynamics simulations are computationally demanding.
Reaching spatial and temporal scales where interesting scientific phenomena can
be observed requires efficient and scalable implementations on modern hardware.
In this paper, we focus on optimizing the performance of the widely used
LAMMPS/ReaxC package for multi-core architectures. As hybrid parallelism allows
better leverage of the increasing on-node parallelism, we adopt thread
parallelism in the construction of bonded and nonbonded lists, and in the
computation of complex ReaxFF interactions. To mitigate the I/O overheads due
to large volumes of trajectory data produced and to save users the burden of
post-processing, we also develop a novel in-situ tool for molecular species
analysis. We analyze the performance of the resulting ReaxC-OMP package on
Mira, an IBM Blue Gene/Q supercomputer. For PETN systems of sizes ranging from
32 thousand to 16.6 million particles, we observe speedups in the range of
1.5-4.5x. We observe sustained performance improvements for up to 262,144 cores
(1,048,576 processes) of Mira and a weak scaling efficiency of 91.5% in large
simulations containing 16.6 million particles. The in-situ molecular species
analysis tool incurs only insignificant overheads across various system sizes
and run configurations.

 <dc:description>  This paper concerns the maximum coding rate at which data can be transmitted
over a noncoherent, single-antenna, Rayleigh block-fading channel using an
error-correcting code of a given blocklength with a block-error probability not
exceeding a given value. A high-SNR normal approximation of the maximum coding
rate is presented that becomes accurate as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the number of coherence intervals L over which we code tend to infinity.
Numerical analyses suggest that the approximation is accurate already at SNR
values of 15 dB and when the number of coherence intervals is 10 or more.

 <dc:title>Comparison of Modified Kneser-Ney and Witten-Bell Smoothing Techniques

 <dc:creator>Rusli, Ismail</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Smoothing is one technique to overcome data sparsity in statistical language
model. Although in its mathematical definition there is no explicit dependency
upon specific natural language, different natures of natural languages result
in different effects of smoothing techniques. This is true for Russian language
as shown by Whittaker (1998). In this paper, We compared Modified Kneser-Ney
and Witten-Bell smoothing techniques in statistical language model of Bahasa
Indonesia. We used train sets of totally 22M words that we extracted from
Indonesian version of Wikipedia. As far as we know, this is the largest train
set used to build statistical language model for Bahasa Indonesia. The
experiments with 3-gram, 5-gram, and 7-gram showed that Modified Kneser-Ney
consistently outperforms Witten-Bell smoothing technique in term of perplexity
values. It is interesting to note that our experiments showed 5-gram model for
Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing technique outperforms that of 7-gram. Meanwhile,
Witten-Bell smoothing is consistently improving over the increase of n-gram
order.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that recognizers personalized to each user are much more
effective than user-independent recognizers. With the popularity of smartphones
today, although it is not difficult to collect a large set of audio data for
each user, it is difficult to transcribe it. However, it is now possible to
automatically discover acoustic tokens from unlabeled personal data in an
unsupervised way. We therefore propose a multi-task deep learning framework
called a phoneme-token deep neural network (PTDNN), jointly trained from
unsupervised acoustic tokens discovered from unlabeled data and very limited
transcribed data for personalized acoustic modeling. We term this scenario
&quot;weakly supervised&quot;. The underlying intuition is that the high degree of
similarity between the HMM states of acoustic token models and phoneme models
may help them learn from each other in this multi-task learning framework.
Initial experiments performed over a personalized audio data set recorded from
Facebook posts demonstrated that very good improvements can be achieved in both
frame accuracy and word accuracy over popularly-considered baselines such as
fDLR, speaker code and lightly supervised adaptation. This approach complements
existing speaker adaptation approaches and can be used jointly with such
techniques to yield improved results.

 <dc:title>Generalization of a reduced Trefftz type approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Diab, Sulaiman Abo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Summary This work presents variational concepts associated with reduced
Trefftz type approaches and discusses the interrelationship between various
concepts of the displacement, hybrid and Trefftz methods. The basic concept of
the displacement version of the reduced Trefftz method operates on the natural
boundary conditions enforced in an integral form whereas the stress version of
the reduced Trefftz type approach operates on the essential boundary conditions
enforced in an integral sense. The application of the method proposed in the
framework of the finite element method is briefly outlined. The methods used by
the reduced Trefftz type approach for enforcing conformity and interelement
continuity between neighboured elements are also discussed. Comparisons with
other known methods for the same purpose are performed. General strategy for
developing finite elements of general geometric form such as quadrilateral
elements with invariance properties is presented. The basic idea of this
strategy consists in using the natural coordinate system only for defining the
element geometry and performing the element integration in the biunit interval.
For defining the approximation functions a local coordinate system defined from
the directions of the covariant base vectors and the perpendicular
contravariant base vectors computed in the geometric centre of the element is
used. This strategy can also be used to implement other versions of finite
elements and other forms of finite elements. Different numerical calculations
and comparisons in the linear statics and kinetics are performed in order to
assess the convergence and the numerical performance of finite elements
developed by applying the reduced Trefftz type approach.

 <dc:description>  We present and apply a general-purpose, multi-start algorithm for improving
the performance of low-energy samplers used for solving optimization problems.
The algorithm iteratively fixes the value of a large portion of the variables
to values that have a high probability of being optimal. The resulting problems
are smaller and less connected, and samplers tend to give better low-energy
samples for these problems. The algorithm is trivially parallelizable, since
each start in the multi-start algorithm is independent, and could be applied to
any heuristic solver that can be run multiple times to give a sample. We
present results for several classes of hard problems solved using simulated
annealing, path-integral quantum Monte Carlo, parallel tempering with
isoenergetic cluster moves, and a quantum annealer, and show that the success
metrics as well as the scaling are improved substantially. When combined with
this algorithm, the quantum annealer's scaling was substantially improved for
native Chimera graph problems. In addition, with this algorithm the scaling of
the time to solution of the quantum annealer is comparable to the Hamze--de
Freitas--Selby algorithm on the weak-strong cluster problems introduced by
Boixo et al. Parallel tempering with isoenergetic cluster moves was able to
consistently solve 3D spin glass problems with 8000 variables when combined
with our method, whereas without our method it could not solve any.

 <dc:title>Inferring Structural Characteristics of Networks with Strong and Weak

 <dc:description>  Knowing the structure of an offline social network facilitates a variety of
analyses, including studying the rate at which infectious diseases may spread
and identifying a subset of actors to immunize in order to reduce, as much as
possible, the rate of spread. Offline social network topologies are typically
estimated by surveying actors and asking them to list their neighbours. While
identifying close friends and family (i.e., strong ties) can typically be done
reliably, listing all of one's acquaintances (i.e., weak ties) is subject to
error due to respondent fatigue. This issue is commonly circumvented through
the use of so-called &quot;fixed choice&quot; surveys where respondents are asked to name
a fixed, small number of their weak ties (e.g., two or ten). Of course, the
resulting crude observed network will omit many ties, and using this crude
network to infer properties of the network, such as its degree distribution or
clustering coefficient, will lead to biased estimates. This paper develops
estimators, based on the method of moments, for a number of network
characteristics including those related to the first and second moments of the
degree distribution as well as the network size, using fixed-choice survey
data. Experiments with simulated data illustrate that the proposed estimators
perform well across a variety of network topologies and measurement scenarios,
and the resulting estimates are significantly more accurate than those obtained
directly using the crude observed network, which are commonly used in the
literature. We also describe a variation of the Jackknife procedure that can be
used to obtain an estimate of the estimator variance.

 <dc:description>  Recently, with the advancement of the GPS-enabled cellular technologies, the
location-based services (LBS) have gained in popularity. Nowadays, an
increasingly larger number of map-based applications enable users to ask a
wider variety of queries. Researchers have studied the ride-sharing, the
carpooling, the vehicle routing, and the collective travel planning problems
extensively in recent years. Collective traveling has the benefit of being
environment-friendly by reducing the global travel cost, the greenhouse gas
emission, and the energy consumption. In this paper, we introduce several
optimization problems to recommend a suitable route and stops of a vehicle, in
a road network, for a group of users intending to travel collectively. The goal
of each problem is to minimize the aggregate cost of the individual travelers'
paths and the shared route under various constraints. First, we formulate the
problem of determining the optimal pair of end-stops, given a set of queries
that originate and terminate near the two prospective end regions. We outline a
baseline polynomial-time algorithm and propose a new faster solution - both
calculating an exact answer. In our approach, we utilize the path-coherence
property of road networks to develop an efficient algorithm. Second, we define
the problem of calculating the optimal route and intermediate stops of a
vehicle that picks up and drops off passengers en-route, given its start and
end stoppages, and a set of path queries from users. We outline an exact
solution of both time and space complexities exponential in the number of
queries. Then, we propose a novel polynomial-time-and-space heuristic algorithm
that performs reasonably well in practice. We also analyze several variants of
this problem under different constraints. Last, we perform extensive
experiments that demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithms.

 <dc:title>Formation Maneuvering Control of Multiple Nonholonomic Robotic Vehicles:

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a new leader-follower type solution to the
formation maneuvering problem for multiple, nonholonomic wheeled mobile robots.
The solution is based on the graph that models the coordination among the
robots being a spanning tree. Our decentralized control law ensures, in the
least squares sense, that the robots globally acquire a given planar formation
while the formation as a whole globally tracks a desired trajectory. The
control law is first designed at the kinematic level and then extended to the
dynamic level. In the latter, we consider that parametric uncertainty exists in
the equations of motion. These uncertainties are accounted for by employing an
adaptive control scheme. The proposed formation maneuvering controls are
demonstrated experimentally and numerically.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we study algorithms for dynamic networks with asynchronous
start, i.e., each node may start running the algorithm in a different round.
Inactive nodes transmit only heartbeats, which contain no information but can
be detected by active nodes. We make no assumption on the way the nodes are
awakened, except that for each node u there is a time $s_u$ in which it is
awakened and starts to run the algorithm. The identities of the nodes are not
mutually known, and the network size is unknown as well.
  We present synchronization algorithms, which guarantee that after a finite
number of rounds, all nodes hold the same round number, which is incremented by
one each round thereafter. We study the time complexity and message size
required for synchronization, and specifically for simultaneous
synchronization, in which all nodes synchronize their round numbers at exactly
the same round.
  We show that there is a strong relation between the complexity of
simultaneous synchronization and the connectivity of the dynamic graphs: With
high connectivity which guarantees that messages can be broadcasted in a
constant number of rounds, simultaneous synchronization by all nodes can be
obtained by a deterministic algorithm within a constant number of rounds, and
with messages of constant size. With a weaker connectivity, which only
guarantees that the broadcast time is proportional to the network size, our
algorithms still achieve simultaneous synchronization, but within linear time
and long messages.
  We also discuss how information on the network size and randomization may
improve synchronization algorithms, and show related impossibility results.

 <dc:title>Growing Linear Consensus Networks Endowed by Spectral Systemic

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Spectral Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose an axiomatic approach for design and performance analysis of noisy
linear consensus networks by introducing a notion of systemic performance
measure. This class of measures are spectral functions of Laplacian eigenvalues
of the network that are monotone, convex, and orthogonally invariant with
respect to the Laplacian matrix of the network. It is shown that several
existing gold-standard and widely used performance measures in the literature
belong to this new class of measures. We build upon this new notion and
investigate a general form of combinatorial problem of growing a linear
consensus network via minimizing a given systemic performance measure. Two
efficient polynomial-time approximation algorithms are devised to tackle this
network synthesis problem: a linearization-based method and a simple greedy
algorithm based on rank-one updates. Several theoretical fundamental limits on
the best achievable performance for the combinatorial problem is derived that
assist us to evaluate optimality gaps of our proposed algorithms. A detailed
complexity analysis confirms the effectiveness and viability of our algorithms
to handle large-scale consensus networks.

 <dc:description>  Managing dynamic information in large multi-site, multi-species, and
multi-discipline consortia is a challenging task for data management
applications. Often in academic research studies the goals for informatics
teams are to build applications that provide extract-transform-load (ETL)
functionality to archive and catalog source data that has been collected by the
research teams. In consortia that cross species and methodological or
scientific domains, building interfaces that supply data in a usable fashion
and make intuitive sense to scientists from dramatically different backgrounds
increases the complexity for developers. Further, reusing source data from
outside one's scientific domain is fraught with ambiguities in understanding
the data types, analysis methodologies, and how to combine the data with those
from other research teams. We report on the design, implementation, and
performance of a semantic data management application to support the NIMH
funded Conte Center at the University of California, Irvine. The Center is
testing a theory of the consequences of &quot;fragmented&quot; (unpredictable, high
entropy) early-life experiences on adolescent cognitive and emotional outcomes
in both humans and rodents. It employs cross-species neuroimaging, epigenomic,
molecular, and neuroanatomical approaches in humans and rodents to assess the
potential consequences of fragmented unpredictable experience on brain
structure and circuitry. To address this multi-technology, multi-species
approach, the system uses semantic web techniques based on the Neuroimaging
Data Model (NIDM) to facilitate data ETL functionality. We find this approach
enables a low-cost, easy to maintain, and semantically meaningful information
management system, enabling the diverse research teams to access and use the
data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose to utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
the segmentation-based multi-scale analysis to locate tampered areas in digital
images. First, to deal with color input sliding windows of different scales, a
unified CNN architecture is designed. Then, we elaborately design the training
procedures of CNNs on sampled training patches. With a set of robust
multi-scale tampering detectors based on CNNs, complementary tampering
possibility maps can be generated. Last but not least, a segmentation-based
method is proposed to fuse the maps and generate the final decision map. By
exploiting the benefits of both the small-scale and large-scale analyses, the
segmentation-based multi-scale analysis can lead to a performance leap in
forgery localization of CNNs. Numerous experiments are conducted to demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.

 <dc:description>  We present HARP, a novel method for learning low dimensional embeddings of a
graph's nodes which preserves higher-order structural features. Our proposed
method achieves this by compressing the input graph prior to embedding it,
effectively avoiding troublesome embedding configurations (i.e. local minima)
which can pose problems to non-convex optimization. HARP works by finding a
smaller graph which approximates the global structure of its input. This
simplified graph is used to learn a set of initial representations, which serve
as good initializations for learning representations in the original, detailed
graph. We inductively extend this idea, by decomposing a graph in a series of
levels, and then embed the hierarchy of graphs from the coarsest one to the
original graph. HARP is a general meta-strategy to improve all of the
state-of-the-art neural algorithms for embedding graphs, including DeepWalk,
LINE, and Node2vec. Indeed, we demonstrate that applying HARP's hierarchical
paradigm yields improved implementations for all three of these methods, as
evaluated on both classification tasks on real-world graphs such as DBLP,
BlogCatalog, CiteSeer, and Arxiv, where we achieve a performance gain over the
original implementations by up to 14% Macro F1.

 <dc:description>  The Flow Decomposition problem, which asks for the smallest set of weighted
paths that &quot;covers&quot; a flow on a DAG, has recently been used as an important
computational step in transcript assembly. We prove the problem is in FPT when
parameterized by the number of paths by giving a practical linear fpt
algorithm. Further, we implement and engineer a Flow Decomposition solver based
on this algorithm, and evaluate its performance on RNA-sequence data.
Crucially, our solver finds exact solutions while achieving runtimes
competitive with a state-of-the-art heuristic. Finally, we contextualize our
design choices with two hardness results related to preprocessing and weight
recovery. Specifically, $k$-Flow Decomposition does not admit polynomial
kernels under standard complexity assumptions, and the related problem of
assigning (known) weights to a given set of paths is NP-hard.

 <dc:description>  Loom (LM), a hardware inference accelerator for Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) is presented. In LM every bit of data precision that can be saved
translates to proportional performance gains. Specifically, for convolutional
layers LM's execution time scales inversely proportionally with the precisions
of both weights and activations. For fully-connected layers LM's performance
scales inversely proportionally with the precision of the weights. The LM
accelerator targets area constrained System-on-a-Chip designs such as those
found on mobile devices that cannot afford the multi-megabyte buffers that
would be needed to store each layer on-chip during processing. Experiments on
image classification CNNs show that on average across all networks studied and
assuming that weights are supplied via a High Bandwidth Memory v2 (HBM2)
interface, a configuration of LM outperforms a state-of-the-art bit-parallel
accelerator [1] by 2.34x without any loss in accuracy while being 2.23x more
energy efficient. Moreover, LM can trade-off accuracy for additional
improvements in execution performance and energy efficiency.

 <dc:description>  End-to-end learning treats the entire system as a whole adaptable black box,
which, if sufficient data are available, may learn a system that works very
well for the target task. This principle has recently been applied to several
prototype research on speaker verification (SV), where the feature learning and
classifier are learned together with an objective function that is consistent
with the evaluation metric. An opposite approach to end-to-end is feature
learning, which firstly trains a feature learning model, and then constructs a
back-end classifier separately to perform SV. Recently, both approaches
achieved significant performance gains on SV, mainly attributed to the smart
utilization of deep neural networks. However, the two approaches have not been
carefully compared, and their respective advantages have not been well
discussed. In this paper, we compare the end-to-end and feature learning
approaches on a text-independent SV task. Our experiments on a dataset sampled
from the Fisher database and involving 5,000 speakers demonstrated that the
feature learning approach outperformed the end-to-end approach. This is a
strong support for the feature learning approach, at least with data and
computation resources similar to ours.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a speaker recognition (SRE) task with trivial speech
events, such as cough and laugh. These trivial events are ubiquitous in
conversations and less subjected to intentional change, therefore offering
valuable particularities to discover the genuine speaker from disguised speech.
However, trivial events are often short and idiocratic in spectral patterns,
making SRE extremely difficult. Fortunately, we found a very powerful deep
feature learning structure that can extract highly speaker-sensitive features.
By employing this tool, we studied the SRE performance on three types of
trivial events: cough, laugh and &quot;Wei&quot; (a short Chinese &quot;Hello&quot;). The results
show that there is rich speaker information within these trivial events, even
for cough that is intuitively less speaker distinguishable. With the deep
feature approach, the EER can reach 10%-14% with the three trivial events,
despite their extremely short durations (0.2-1.0 seconds).

 <dc:description>  Existing speaker verification (SV) systems often suffer from performance
degradation if there is any language mismatch between model training, speaker
enrollment, and test. A major cause of this degradation is that most existing
SV methods rely on a probabilistic model to infer the speaker factor, so any
significant change on the distribution of the speech signal will impact the
inference. Recently, we proposed a deep learning model that can learn how to
extract the speaker factor by a deep neural network (DNN). By this feature
learning, an SV system can be constructed with a very simple back-end model. In
this paper, we investigate the robustness of the feature-based SV system in
situations with language mismatch. Our experiments were conducted on a complex
cross-lingual scenario, where the model training was in English, and the
enrollment and test were in Chinese or Uyghur. The experiments demonstrated
that the feature-based system outperformed the i-vector system with a large
margin, particularly with language mismatch between enrollment and test.

procedure for mildly heterogeneous systems and subsequent formulation of
counting constraints as linear inequalities.

 <dc:description>  Hierarchical models are utilized in a wide variety of problems which are
characterized by task hierarchies, where predictions on smaller subtasks are
useful for trying to predict a final task. Typically, neural networks are first
trained for the subtasks, and the predictions of these networks are
subsequently used as additional features when training a model and doing
inference for a final task. In this work, we focus on improving learning for
such hierarchical models and demonstrate our method on the task of speaker
trait prediction. Speaker trait prediction aims to computationally identify
which personality traits a speaker might be perceived to have, and has been of
great interest to both the Artificial Intelligence and Social Science
communities. Persuasiveness prediction in particular has been of interest, as
persuasive speakers have a large amount of influence on our thoughts, opinions
and beliefs. In this work, we examine how leveraging the relationship between
related speaker traits in a hierarchical structure can help improve our ability
to predict how persuasive a speaker is. We present a novel algorithm that
allows us to backpropagate through this hierarchy. This hierarchical model
achieves a 25% relative error reduction in classification accuracy over current
state-of-the art methods on the publicly available POM dataset.

 <dc:description>  There is significant recent interest to parallelize deep learning algorithms
in order to handle the enormous growth in data and model sizes. While most
advances focus on model parallelization and engaging multiple computing agents
via using a central parameter server, aspect of data parallelization along with
decentralized computation has not been explored sufficiently. In this context,
this paper presents a new consensus-based distributed SGD (CDSGD) (and its
momentum variant, CDMSGD) algorithm for collaborative deep learning over fixed
topology networks that enables data parallelization as well as decentralized
computation. Such a framework can be extremely useful for learning agents with
access to only local/private data in a communication constrained environment.
We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm with strongly
convex and nonconvex objective functions with fixed and diminishing step sizes
using concepts of Lyapunov function construction. We demonstrate the efficacy
of our algorithms in comparison with the baseline centralized SGD and the
recently proposed federated averaging algorithm (that also enables data
parallelism) based on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in neural networks have inspired people to design hybrid
recommendation algorithms that can incorporate both (1) user-item interaction
information and (2) content information including image, audio, and text.
Despite their promising results, neural network-based recommendation algorithms
pose extensive computational costs, making it challenging to scale and improve
upon. In this paper, we propose a general neural network-based recommendation
framework, which subsumes several existing state-of-the-art recommendation
algorithms, and address the efficiency issue by investigating sampling
strategies in the stochastic gradient descent training for the framework. We
tackle this issue by first establishing a connection between the loss functions
and the user-item interaction bipartite graph, where the loss function terms
are defined on links while major computation burdens are located at nodes. We
call this type of loss functions &quot;graph-based&quot; loss functions, for which varied
mini-batch sampling strategies can have different computational costs. Based on
the insight, three novel sampling strategies are proposed, which can
significantly improve the training efficiency of the proposed framework (up to
$\times 30$ times speedup in our experiments), as well as improving the
recommendation performance. Theoretical analysis is also provided for both the
computational cost and the convergence. We believe the study of sampling
strategies have further implications on general graph-based loss functions, and
would also enable more research under the neural network-based recommendation
framework.

 <dc:description>  Low-rank approximations are popular techniques to reduce the high
computational cost of large-scale kernel matrices, which are of significant
interest in many applications. The success of low-rank methods hinges on the
matrix rank, and in practice, these methods are effective even for
high-dimensional datasets. The practical success has elicited the theoretical
analysis of the rank in this paper. We will consider radial basis functions
(RBF) and present theorems on the rank and error bounds. Our three main results
are as follows. First, the rank of RBFs grows polynomially with the data
dimension, in the worst case; second, precise approximation error bounds in
terms of function properties and data structures are derived; and last, a group
pattern in the decay of singular values for RBF kernel matrices is analyzed,
and is explained by a grouping of the expansion terms. Empirical results verify
and illustrate the theoretical results.

 <dc:description>  The fundamental matrix (FM) describes the geometric relations that exist
between two images of the same scene. Different error criteria are used for
estimating FMs from an input set of correspondences. In this paper, the
accuracy and efficiency aspects of the different error criteria were studied.
We mathematically and experimentally proved that the most popular error
criterion, the symmetric epipolar distance, is biased. It was also shown that
despite the similarity between the algebraic expressions of the symmetric
epipolar distance and Sampson distance, they have different accuracy
properties. In addition, a new error criterion, Kanatani distance, was proposed
and was proved to be the most effective for use during the outlier removal
phase from accuracy and efficiency perspectives. To thoroughly test the
accuracy of the different error criteria, we proposed a randomized algorithm
for Reprojection Error-based Correspondence Generation (RE-CG). As input, RE-CG
takes an FM and a desired reprojection error value $d$. As output, RE-CG
generates a random correspondence having that error value. Mathematical
analysis of this algorithm revealed that the success probability for any given
trial is 1 - (2/3)^2 at best and is 1 - (6/7)^2 at worst while experiments
demonstrated that the algorithm often succeeds after only one trial.

 <dc:description>  Satellite imagery and remote sensing provide explanatory variables at
relatively high resolutions for modeling geospatial phenomena, yet regional
summaries are often desirable for analysis and actionable insight. In this
paper, we propose a novel method of inducing spatial aggregations as a
component of the machine learning process, yielding regional model features
whose construction is driven by model prediction performance rather than prior
assumptions. Our results demonstrate that Genetic Programming is particularly
well suited to this type of feature construction because it can automatically
synthesize appropriate aggregations, as well as better incorporate them into
predictive models compared to other regression methods we tested. In our
experiments we consider a specific problem instance and real-world dataset
relevant to predicting snow properties in high-mountain Asia.

 <dc:title>A Note on a Communication Game</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Drucker, Andrew</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We describe a communication game, and a conjecture about this game, whose
proof would imply the well-known Sensitivity Conjecture asserting a polynomial
relation between sensitivity and block sensitivity for Boolean functions. The
author defined this game and observed the connection in Dec. 2013 - Jan. 2014.
The game and connection were independently discovered by Gilmer, Kouck\'y, and
Saks, who also established further results about the game (not proved by us)
and published their results in ITCS '15 [GKS15].
  This note records our independent work, including some observations that did
not appear in [GKS15]. Namely, the main conjecture about this communication
game would imply not only the Sensitivity Conjecture, but also a stronger
hypothesis raised by Chung, F\&quot;uredi, Graham, and Seymour [CFGS88]; and,
another related conjecture we pose about a &quot;query-bounded&quot; variant of our
communication game would suffice to answer a question of Aaronson, Ambainis,
Balodis, and Bavarian [AABB14] about the query complexity of the &quot;Weak Parity&quot;
problem---a question whose resolution was previously shown by [AABB14] to
follow from a proof of the Chung et al. hypothesis.

 <dc:title>Seasonality in Dynamic Stochastic Block Models</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sociotechnological and geospatial processes exhibit time varying structure
that make insight discovery challenging. This paper proposes a new statistical
model for such systems, modeled as dynamic networks, to address this challenge.
It assumes that vertices fall into one of k types and that the probability of
edge formation at a particular time depends on the types of the incident nodes
and the current time. The time dependencies are driven by unique seasonal
processes, which many systems exhibit (e.g., predictable spikes in geospatial
or web traffic each day). The paper defines the model as a generative process
and an inference procedure to recover the seasonal processes from data when
they are unknown. Evaluation with synthetic dynamic networks show the recovery
of the latent seasonal processes that drive its formation.

 <dc:description>  Reservoir Computing (RC) refers to a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
framework, frequently used for sequence learning and time series prediction.
The RC system consists of a random fixed-weight RNN (the input-hidden reservoir
layer) and a classifier (the hidden-output readout layer). Here we focus on the
sequence learning problem, and we explore a different approach to RC. More
specifically, we remove the non-linear neural activation function, and we
consider an orthogonal reservoir acting on normalized states on the unit
hypersphere. Surprisingly, our numerical results show that the system's memory
capacity exceeds the dimensionality of the reservoir, which is the upper bound
for the typical RC approach based on Echo State Networks (ESNs). We also show
how the proposed system can be applied to symmetric cryptography problems, and
we include a numerical implementation.

 <dc:title>Tree-Residue Vertex-Breaking: a new tool for proving hardness</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>F.1.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a new problem called Tree-Residue Vertex-Breaking
(TRVB): given a multigraph $G$ some of whose vertices are marked &quot;breakable,&quot;
is it possible to convert $G$ into a tree via a sequence of &quot;vertex-breaking&quot;
operations (disconnecting the edges at a degree-$k$ breakable vertex by
replacing that vertex with $k$ degree-$1$ vertices)? We consider the special
cases of TRVB with any combination of the following additional constraints: $G$
must be planar, $G$ must be a simple graph, the degree of every breakable
vertex must belong to an allowed list $B$, and the degree of every unbreakable
vertex must belong to an allowed list $U$. We fully characterize these variants
of TRVB as polynomially solvable or NP-complete. The two results which we
expect to be most generally applicable are that (1) TRVB is polynomially
solvable when breakable vertices are restricted to have degree at most $3$; and
(2) for any $k \ge 4$, TRVB is NP-complete when the given multigraph is
restricted to be planar and to consist entirely of degree-$k$ breakable
vertices. To demonstrate the use of TRVB, we give a simple proof of the known
result that Hamiltonicity in max-degree-$3$ square grid graphs is NP-hard.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a deep mixture of diverse experts algorithm is developed for
seamlessly combining a set of base deep CNNs (convolutional neural networks)
with diverse outputs (task spaces), e.g., such base deep CNNs are trained to
recognize different subsets of tens of thousands of atomic object classes.
First, a two-layer (category layer and object class layer) ontology is
constructed to achieve more effective solution for task group generation, e.g.,
assigning the semantically-related atomic object classes at the sibling leaf
nodes into the same task group because they may share similar learning
complexities. Second, one particular base deep CNNs with $M+1$ ($M \leq 1,000$)
outputs is learned for each task group to recognize its $M$ atomic object
classes effectively and identify one special class of &quot;not-in-group&quot;
automatically, and the network structure (numbers of layers and units in each
layer) of the well-designed AlexNet is directly used to configure such base
deep CNNs. A deep multi-task learning algorithm is developed to leverage the
inter-class visual similarities to learn more discriminative base deep CNNs and
multi-task softmax for enhancing the separability of the atomic object classes
in the same task group. Finally, all these base deep CNNs with diverse outputs
(task spaces) are seamlessly combined to form a deep mixture of diverse experts
for recognizing tens of thousands of atomic object classes. Our experimental
results have demonstrated that our deep mixture of diverse experts algorithm
can achieve very competitive results on large-scale visual recognition.

 <dc:description>  Caching and multicasting are two promising methods to support massive content
delivery in multi-tier wireless networks. In this paper, we consider a random
caching and multicasting scheme with caching distributions in the two tiers as
design parameters, to achieve efficient content dissemination in a two-tier
large-scale cache-enabled wireless multicasting network. First, we derive
tractable expressions for the successful transmission probabilities in the
general region as well as the high SNR and high user density region,
respectively, utilizing tools from stochastic geometry. Then, for the case of a
single operator for the two tiers, we formulate the optimal joint caching
design problem to maximize the successful transmission probability in the
asymptotic region, which is nonconvex in general. By using the block successive
approximate optimization technique, we develop an iterative algorithm, which is
shown to converge to a stationary point. Next, for the case of two different
operators, one for each tier, we formulate the competitive caching design game
where each tier maximizes its successful transmission probability in the
asymptotic region. We show that the game has a unique Nash equilibrium (NE) and
develop an iterative algorithm, which is shown to converge to the NE under a
mild condition. Finally, by numerical simulations, we show that the proposed
designs achieve significant gains over existing schemes.

 <dc:description>  Starting from NMT, encoder-decoder neu- ral networks have been used for many
NLP problems. Graph-based models and transition-based models borrowing the en-
coder components achieve state-of-the-art performance on dependency parsing and
constituent parsing, respectively. How- ever, there has not been work
empirically studying the encoder-decoder neural net- works for transition-based
parsing. We apply a simple encoder-decoder to this end, achieving comparable
results to the parser of Dyer et al. (2015) on standard de- pendency parsing,
and outperforming the parser of Vinyals et al. (2015) on con- stituent parsing.

 <dc:description>  In this work we propose, implement, and evaluate GRM, a novel mobility model
that accounts for the role of group meeting dynamics and regularity in human
mobility. Specifically, we show that existing mobility models for humans do not
capture the regularity of human group meetings which is present in real
mobility traces. Next, we characterize the statistical properties of such group
meetings in real mobility traces and design GRM accordingly. We show that GRM
maintains the typical pairwise contact properties of real traces, such as
contact duration and inter-contact time distributions. In addition, GRM
accounts for the role of group mobility, presenting group meetings regularity
and social communities' structure. Finally, we evaluate state-of-art
social-aware protocols for opportunistic routing using a synthetic contact
trace generated by our model. The results show that the behavior of such
protocols in our model is similar to their behavior in real mobility traces.

 <dc:description>  This paper is the first work to perform spatio-temporal mapping of human
activity using the visual content of geo-tagged videos. We utilize a recent
deep-learning based video analysis framework, termed hidden two-stream
networks, to recognize a range of activities in YouTube videos. This framework
is efficient and can run in real time or faster which is important for
recognizing events as they occur in streaming video or for reducing latency in
analyzing already captured video. This is, in turn, important for using video
in smart-city applications. We perform a series of experiments to show our
approach is able to accurately map activities both spatially and temporally. We
also demonstrate the advantages of using the visual content over the
tags/titles.

 <dc:description>  In this work, a problem associated with imbalanced text corpora is addressed.
A method of converting an imbalanced text corpus into a balanced one is
presented. The presented method employs a clustering algorithm for conversion.
Initially to avoid curse of dimensionality, an effective representation scheme
based on term class relevancy measure is adapted, which drastically reduces the
dimension to the number of classes in the corpus. Subsequently, the samples of
larger sized classes are grouped into a number of subclasses of smaller sizes
to make the entire corpus balanced. Each subclass is then given a single
symbolic vector representation by the use of interval valued features. This
symbolic representation in addition to being compact helps in reducing the
space requirement and also the classification time. The proposed model has been
empirically demonstrated for its superiority on bench marking datasets viz.,
Reuters 21578 and TDT2. Further, it has been compared against several other
existing contemporary models including model based on support vector machine.
The comparative analysis indicates that the proposed model outperforms the
other existing models.

classification of text documents. A method of labeling unlabeled text documents
is presented. The presented method is based on the principle of divide and
conquer strategy. It uses recursive K-means algorithm for partitioning both
labeled and unlabeled data collection. The K-means algorithm is applied
recursively on each partition till a desired level partition is achieved such
that each partition contains labeled documents of a single class. Once the
desired clusters are obtained, the respective cluster centroids are considered
as representatives of the clusters and the nearest neighbor rule is used for
classifying an unknown text document. Series of experiments have been conducted
to bring out the superiority of the proposed model over other recent state of
the art models on 20Newsgroups dataset.

 <dc:description>  It is very difficult to solve the Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) or Maximum
Likelihood (ML) for all possible Shannon Channels or uncertain rules of
choosing hypotheses, so that we have to use iterative methods. According to the
Semantic Mutual Information (SMI) and R(G) function proposed by Chenguang Lu
(1993) (where R(G) is an extension of information rate distortion function
R(D), and G is the lower limit of the SMI), we can obtain a new iterative
algorithm of solving the MMI and ML for tests, estimations, and mixture models.
The SMI is defined by the average log normalized likelihood. The likelihood
function is produced from the truth function and the prior by semantic Bayesian
inference. A group of truth functions constitute a semantic channel. Letting
the semantic channel and Shannon channel mutually match and iterate, we can
obtain the Shannon channel that maximizes the Shannon mutual information and
the average log likelihood. This iterative algorithm is called Channels'
Matching algorithm or the CM algorithm. The convergence can be intuitively
explained and proved by the R(G) function. Several iterative examples for
tests, estimations, and mixture models show that the computation of the CM
algorithm is simple (which can be demonstrated in excel files). For most random
examples, the numbers of iterations for convergence are close to 5. For mixture
models, the CM algorithm is similar to the EM algorithm; however, the CM
algorithm has better convergence and more potential applications in comparison
with the standard EM algorithm.

 <dc:description>  The modeling of speech can be used for speech synthesis and speech
recognition. We present a speech analysis method based on pole-zero modeling of
speech with mixed block sparse and Gaussian excitation. By using a pole-zero
model, instead of the all-pole model, a better spectral fitting can be
expected. Moreover, motivated by the block sparse glottal flow excitation
during voiced speech and the white noise excitation for unvoiced speech, we
model the excitation sequence as a combination of block sparse signals and
white noise. A variational EM (VEM) method is proposed for estimating the
posterior PDFs of the block sparse residuals and point estimates of mod- elling
parameters within a sparse Bayesian learning framework. Compared to
conventional pole-zero and all-pole based methods, experimental results show
that the proposed method has lower spectral distortion and good performance in
reconstructing of the block sparse excitation.

 <dc:title>ISTA-Net: Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm Inspired Deep
  Network for Image Compressive Sensing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Traditional methods for image compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction solve a
well-defined inverse problem that is based on a predefined CS model, which
defines the underlying structure of the problem and is generally solved by
employing convergent iterative solvers. These optimization-based CS methods
face the challenge of choosing optimal transforms and tuning parameters in
their solvers, while also suffering from high computational complexity in most
cases. Recently, some deep network based CS algorithms have been proposed to
improve CS reconstruction performance, while dramatically reducing time
complexity as compared to optimization-based methods. Despite their impressive
results, the proposed networks (either with fully-connected or repetitive
convolutional layers) lack any structural diversity and they are trained as a
black box, void of any insights from the CS domain. In this paper, we combine
the merits of both types of CS methods: the structure insights of
optimization-based method and the performance/speed of network-based ones. We
propose a novel structured deep network, dubbed ISTA-Net, which is inspired by
the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) for optimizing a general
$l_1$ norm CS reconstruction model. ISTA-Net essentially implements a truncated
form of ISTA, where all ISTA-Net parameters are learned end-to-end to minimize
a reconstruction error in training. Borrowing more insights from the
optimization realm, we propose an accelerated version of ISTA-Net, dubbed
FISTA-Net, which is inspired by the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding
algorithm (FISTA). Interestingly, this acceleration naturally leads to skip
connections in the underlying network design. Extensive CS experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ISTA-Net and FISTA-Net outperform existing
optimization-based and network-based CS methods by large margins, while
maintaining a fast runtime.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The paper discusses the challenges of faceted vocabulary organization in
universal classifications which treat the universe of knowledge as a coherent
whole and in which the concepts and subjects in different disciplines are
shared, related and combined. The authors illustrate the challenges of the
facet analytical approach using, as an example, the revision of class 72 in
UDC. The paper reports on the research undertaken in 2013 as preparation for
the revision. This consisted of analysis of concept organization in the UDC
schedules in comparison with the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus and class W of
the Bliss Bibliographic Classification. The paper illustrates how such research
can contribute to a better understanding of the field and may lead to
improvements in the facet structure of this segment of the UDC vocabulary.

 <dc:title>When Can We Answer Queries Using Result-Bounded Data Interfaces?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Amarilli, Antoine</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Benedikt, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider answering queries where the underlying data is available only
over limited interfaces which provide lookup access to the tuples matching a
given binding, but possibly restricting the number of output tuples returned.
Interfaces imposing such &quot;result bounds&quot; are common in accessing data via the
web. Given a query over a set of relations as well as some integrity
constraints that relate the queried relations to the data sources, we examine
the problem of deciding if the query is answerable over the interfaces; that
is, whether there exists a plan that returns all answers to the query, assuming
the source data satisfies the integrity constraints.
  The first component of our analysis of answerability is a reduction to a
query containment problem with constraints. The second component is a set of
&quot;schema simplification&quot; theorems capturing limitations on how interfaces with
result bounds can be useful to obtain complete answers to queries. These
results also help to show decidability for the containment problem that
captures answerability, for many classes of constraints. The final component in
our analysis of answerability is a &quot;linearization&quot; method, showing that query
containment with certain guarded dependencies -- including those that emerge
from answerability problems -- can be reduced to query containment for a
well-behaved class of linear dependencies. Putting these components together,
we get a detailed picture of how to check answerability over result-bounded
services.

 <dc:title>Justifications in Constraint Handling Rules for Logical Retraction in
  Dynamic Algorithms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fruehwirth, Thom</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a straightforward source-to-source transformation that introduces
justifications for user-defined constraints into the CHR programming language.
Then a scheme of two rules suffices to allow for logical retraction (deletion,
removal) of constraints during computation. Without the need to recompute from
scratch, these rules remove not only the constraint but also undo all
consequences of the rule applications that involved the constraint. We prove a
confluence result concerning the rule scheme and show its correctness. When
algorithms are written in CHR, constraints represent both data and operations.
CHR is already incremental by nature, i.e. constraints can be added at runtime.
Logical retraction adds decrementality. Hence any algorithm written in CHR with
justifications will become fully dynamic. Operations can be undone and data can
be removed at any point in the computation without compromising the correctness
of the result. We present two classical examples of dynamic algorithms, written
in our prototype implementation of CHR with justifications that is available
online: maintaining the minimum of a changing set of numbers and shortest paths
in a graph whose edges change.

 <dc:description>  In the last decade, driven also by the availability of an unprecedented
computational power and storage capabilities in cloud environments we assisted
to the proliferation of new algorithms, methods, and approaches in two areas of
artificial intelligence: knowledge representation and machine learning. On the
one side, the generation of a high rate of structured data on the Web led to
the creation and publication of the so-called knowledge graphs. On the other
side, deep learning emerged as one of the most promising approaches in the
generation and training of models that can be applied to a wide variety of
application fields. More recently, autoencoders have proven their strength in
various scenarios, playing a fundamental role in unsupervised learning. In this
paper, we instigate how to exploit the semantic information encoded in a
knowledge graph to build connections between units in a Neural Network, thus
leading to a new method, SEM-AUTO, to extract and weigh semantic features that
can eventually be used to build a recommender system. As adding content-based
side information may mitigate the cold user problems, we tested how our
approach behave in the presence of a few rating from a user on the Movielens 1M
dataset and compare results with BPRSLIM.

 <dc:description>  YouTube-8M is the largest video dataset for multi-label video classification.
In order to tackle the multi-label classification on this challenging dataset,
it is necessary to solve several issues such as temporal modeling of videos,
label imbalances, and correlations between labels. We develop a deep neural
network model, which consists of four components: the frame encoder, the
classification layer, the label processing layer, and the loss function. We
introduce our newly proposed methods and discusses how existing models operate
in the YouTube-8M Classification Task, what insights they have, and why they
succeed (or fail) to achieve good performance. Most of the models we proposed
are very high compared to the baseline models, and the ensemble of the models
we used is 8th in the Kaggle Competition.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional kernels are basic and vital components of deep Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN). In this paper, we equip convolutional kernels with shape
attributes to generate the deep Irregular Convolutional Neural Networks (ICNN).
Compared to traditional CNN applying regular convolutional kernels like
${3\times3}$, our approach trains irregular kernel shapes to better fit the
geometric variations of input features. In other words, shapes are learnable
parameters in addition to weights. The kernel shapes and weights are learned
simultaneously during end-to-end training with the standard back-propagation
algorithm. Experiments for semantic segmentation are implemented to validate
the effectiveness of our proposed ICNN.

 <dc:description>  Most information spreading models consider that all individuals are identical
psychologically. They ignore, for instance, the curiosity level of people,
which may indicate that they can be influenced to seek for information given
their interest. For example, the game Pok\'emon GO spread rapidly because of
the aroused curiosity among users. This paper proposes an information
propagation model considering the curiosity level of each individual, which is
a dynamical parameter that evolves over time. We evaluate the efficiency of our
model in contrast to traditional information propagation models, like SIR or
IC, and perform analysis on different types of artificial and real-world
networks, like Google+, Facebook, and the United States roads map. We present a
mean-field approach that reproduces with a good accuracy the evolution of
macroscopic quantities, such as the density of stiflers, for the system's
behavior with the curiosity. We also obtain an analytical solution of the
mean-field equations that allows to predicts a transition from a phase where
the information remains confined to a small number of users to a phase where it
spreads over a large fraction of the population. The results indicate that the
curiosity increases the information spreading in all networks as compared with
the spreading without curiosity, and that this increase is larger in spatial
networks than in social networks. When the curiosity is taken into account, the
maximum number of informed individuals is reached close to the transition
point. Since curious people are more open to a new product, concepts, and
ideas, this is an important factor to be considered in propagation modeling.
Our results contribute to the understanding of the interplay between diffusion
process and dynamical heterogeneous transmission in social networks.

Simulations are conducted to illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:title>Theory and Practice of Data Citation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Silvello, Gianmaria</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Citations are the cornerstone of knowledge propagation and the primary means
of assessing the quality of research, as well as directing investments in
science. Science is increasingly becoming &quot;data-intensive&quot;, where large volumes
of data are collected and analyzed to discover complex patterns through
simulations and experiments, and most scientific reference works have been
replaced by online curated datasets. Yet, given a dataset, there is no
quantitative, consistent and established way of knowing how it has been used
over time, who contributed to its curation, what results have been yielded or
what value it has.
  The development of a theory and practice of data citation is fundamental for
considering data as first-class research objects with the same relevance and
centrality of traditional scientific products. Many works in recent years have
discussed data citation from different viewpoints: illustrating why data
citation is needed, defining the principles and outlining recommendations for
data citation systems, and providing computational methods for addressing
specific issues of data citation.
  The current panorama is many-faceted and an overall view that brings together
diverse aspects of this topic is still missing. Therefore, this paper aims to
describe the lay of the land for data citation, both from the theoretical (the
why and what) and the practical (the how) angle.

 <dc:description>  This paper provides an entry point to the problem of interpreting a deep
neural network model and explaining its predictions. It is based on a tutorial
given at ICASSP 2017. It introduces some recently proposed techniques of
interpretation, along with theory, tricks and recommendations, to make most
efficient use of these techniques on real data. It also discusses a number of
practical applications.

 <dc:title>In Search of Effectful Dependent Types</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>V&#xe1;k&#xe1;r, Matthijs</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Real world programming languages crucially depend on the availability of
computational effects to achieve programming convenience and expressive power
as well as program efficiency. Logical frameworks rely on predicates, or
dependent types, to express detailed logical properties about entities.
According to the Curry-Howard correspondence, programming languages and logical
frameworks should be very closely related. However, a language that has both
good support for real programming and serious proving is still missing from the
programming languages zoo. We believe this is due to a fundamental lack of
understanding of how dependent types should interact with computational
effects. In this thesis, we make a contribution towards such an understanding,
with a focus on semantic methods.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we extend the conventional framework of
convolutional-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine to learn highly abstract features
among abitrary number of time related input maps by constructing a layer of
multiplicative units, which capture the relations among inputs. In many cases,
more than two maps are strongly related, so it is wise to make multiplicative
unit learn relations among more input maps, in other words, to find the optimal
relational-order of each unit. In order to enable our machine to learn
relational order, we developed a reinforcement-learning method whose optimality
is proven to train the network.

 <dc:title>OS Fingerprinting: New Techniques and a Study of Information Gain and

 <dc:creator>Anderson, Blake</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Passive operating system fingerprinting reveals valuable information to the
defenders of heterogeneous private networks; at the same time, attackers can
use fingerprinting to reconnoiter networks, so defenders need obfuscation
techniques to foil them. We present an effective approach for passive
fingerprinting that uses data features from TLS as well as the TCP/IP and HTTP
protocols in a multi-session model, which is applicable whenever several
sessions can be observed within a time window. In experiments on a real-world
private network, our approach identified operating system major and minor
versions with accuracies of 99.4% and 97.5%, respectively, and provided
significant information gain. We also show that obfuscation strategies can
often be defeated due to the difficulty of manipulating data features from all
protocols, especially TLS, by studying how obfuscation affects our
fingerprinting system. Because devices running unpatched operating systems on
private networks create significant vulnerabilities, their detection is
critical; our approach achieved over 98% accuracy at this important goal.

 <dc:title>Local Refinement Typing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cosman, Benjamin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Jhala, Ranjit</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce the Fusion algorithm for local refinement type inference,
yielding a new SMT-based method for verifying programs with polymorphic data
types and higher-order functions. Fusion is concise as the programmer need only
write signatures for (externally exported) top-level functions and places with
cyclic (recursive) dependencies, after which Fusion can predictably synthesize
the most precise refinement types for all intermediate terms (expressible in
the decidable refinement logic), thereby checking the program without false
alarms. We have implemented Fusion and evaluated it on the benchmarks from the
LiquidHaskell suite totalling about 12KLOC. Fusion checks an existing safety
benchmark suite using about half as many templates as previously required and
nearly 2x faster. In a new set of theorem proving benchmarks Fusion is both 10
- 50x faster and, by synthesizing the most precise types, avoids false alarms
to make verification possible.

 <dc:description>  In the era when the market segment of Internet of Things (IoT) tops the chart
in various business reports, it is apparently envisioned that the field of
medicine expects to gain a large benefit from the explosion of wearables and
internet-connected sensors that surround us to acquire and communicate
unprecedented data on symptoms, medication, food intake, and daily-life
activities impacting one's health and wellness. However, IoT-driven healthcare
would have to overcome many barriers, such as: 1) There is an increasing demand
for data storage on cloud servers where the analysis of the medical big data
becomes increasingly complex, 2) The data, when communicated, are vulnerable to
security and privacy issues, 3) The communication of the continuously collected
data is not only costly but also energy hungry, 4) Operating and maintaining
the sensors directly from the cloud servers are non-trial tasks. This book
chapter defined Fog Computing in the context of medical IoT. Conceptually, Fog
Computing is a service-oriented intermediate layer in IoT, providing the
interfaces between the sensors and cloud servers for facilitating connectivity,
data transfer, and queryable local database. The centerpiece of Fog computing
is a low-power, intelligent, wireless, embedded computing node that carries out
signal conditioning and data analytics on raw data collected from wearables or
other medical sensors and offers efficient means to serve telehealth
interventions. We implemented and tested an fog computing system using the
Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi that allows acquisition, computing, storage and
communication of the various medical data such as pathological speech data of
individuals with speech disorders, Phonocardiogram (PCG) signal for heart rate
estimation, and Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based Q, R, S detection.

 <dc:description>  Art Gallery Localization (AGL) is the problem of placing a set $T$ of
broadcast towers in a simple polygon $P$ in order for a point to locate itself
in the interior. For any point $p \in P$: for each tower $t \in T \cap V(p)$
(where $V(p)$ denotes the visibility polygon of $p$) the point $p$ receives the
coordinates of $t$ and the Euclidean distance between $t$ and $p$. From this
information $p$ can determine its coordinates. We study the computational
complexity of AGL problem. We show that the problem of determining the minimum
number of broadcast towers that can localize a point anywhere in a simple
polygon $P$ is NP-hard. We show a reduction from Boolean Three Satisfiability
problem to our problem and give a proof that the reduction takes polynomial
time.

 <dc:description>  Cloud security is one of the biggest concerns for many companies. The growth
in the number and size of websites increases the need for better securing those
websites. Manual testing and detection of web vulnerabilities can be very time
consuming. Automated Web Vulnerability Scanners (WVS) help with the detection
of vulnerabilities in web applications. Acunetix is one of the widely used
vulnerability scanners. Acunetix is also easy to implement and to use. The scan
results not only provide the details of the vulnerabilities, but also give
information about fixing the vulnerabilities. AcuSensor and AcuMonitor
(technologies used by Acunetix) help generate more accurate potential
vulnerability results. One of the purposes of this paper is to orient current
students of computer security with using vulnerability scanners. Secondly, this
paper provides a literature review related to the topic of security
vulnerability scanners. Finally, web vulnerabilities are addressed from the
mobile device and browser perspectives.

addressed in the past and it becomes challenging for students to connect with
the right faculty of their domain. Since we have so many colleges and faculties
this lies in the category of big data problem. In this paper, we present a

The proposed model uses apache spark as an execution engine and hive as

 <dc:title>Online Power Control for Block i.i.d. Energy Harvesting Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shaviv, Dor</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of online power control for energy harvesting
communication nodes with random energy arrivals and a finite battery. We assume
a block i.i.d. stochastic model for the energy arrivals, in which the energy
arrivals are constant for a fixed duration $T$, but are independent across
different blocks, drawn from an arbitrary distribution. This model serves as a
simple approximation to a random process with coherence time $T$. We propose a
simple online power control policy, and prove that its performance gap to the
optimal throughput is bounded by a constant which is independent of the
parameters of the problem. This also yields a simple formula for the
approximately optimal long-term average throughput, which sheds some light on
the qualitative behavior of the throughput and how it depends on the coherence
time of the energy arrival process. Our results show that, perhaps
counter-intuitively, for a fixed mean energy arrival rate the throughput
decreases with increasing coherence time $T$ of the energy arrival process. In
particular, the battery size needed to approach the AWGN capacity of the
channel increases linearly with the coherence time of the process. Finally, we
show that our results can provide an approximation to the information-theoretic
capacity of the same channel.

 <dc:description>  The $p$-set, which is in a simple analytic form, is well distributed in unit
cubes. The well-known Weil's exponential sum theorem presents an upper bound of
the exponential sum over the $p$-set. Based on the result, one shows that the
$p$-set performs well in numerical integration, in compressed sensing as well
as in UQ. However, $p$-set is somewhat rigid since the cardinality of the
$p$-set is a prime $p$ and the set only depends on the prime number $p$. The
purpose of this paper is to present generalizations of $p$-sets, say
$\mathcal{P}_{d,p}^{{\mathbf a},\epsilon}$, which is more flexible.
Particularly, when a prime number $p$ is given, we have many different choices
of the new $p$-sets. Under the assumption that Goldbach conjecture holds, for
any even number $m$, we present a point set, say ${\mathcal L}_{p,q}$, with
cardinality $m-1$ by combining two different new $p$-sets, which overcomes a
major bottleneck of the $p$-set. We also present the upper bounds of the
exponential sums over $\mathcal{P}_{d,p}^{{\mathbf a},\epsilon}$ and ${\mathcal
L}_{p,q}$, which imply these sets have many potential applications.

 <dc:title>A Deep Neural Architecture for Sentence-level Sentiment Classification

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework including a
lexicon-based approach for sentence-level prediction of sentiment label
distribution. We propose to first apply semantic rules and then use a Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (DeepCNN) for character-level embeddings in order
to increase information for word-level embedding. After that, a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM) produces a sentence-wide feature
representation from the word-level embedding. We evaluate our approach on three
Twitter sentiment classification datasets. Experimental results show that our
model can improve the classification accuracy of sentence-level sentiment
analysis in Twitter social networking.

corresponding temporal dynamics. By independently modeling motion and content,
predicting the next frame reduces to converting the extracted content features
into the next frame content by the identified motion features, which simplifies
the task of prediction. Our model is end-to-end trainable over multiple time
steps, and naturally learns to decompose motion and content without separate
training. We evaluate the proposed network architecture on human activity
videos using KTH, Weizmann action, and UCF-101 datasets. We show
state-of-the-art performance in comparison to recent approaches. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end trainable network architecture with
motion and content separation to model the spatiotemporal dynamics for
pixel-level future prediction in natural videos.

 <dc:description>  STorage as a Service (STaaS) cloud platforms benefits such as getting access
to data anywhere, anytime, on a wide range of devices made them very popular
among businesses and individuals. As such forensics investigators are
increasingly facing cases that involve investigation of STaaS platforms.
Therefore, it is essential for cyber investigators to know how to collect,
preserve, and analyse evidences of these platforms. In this paper, we describe
investigation of three STaaS platforms namely SpiderOak, JustCloud, and pCloud
on Windows 8.1 and iOS 8.1.1 devices. Moreover, possible changes on uploaded
and downloaded files metadata on these platforms would be tracked and their
forensics value would be investigated.

 <dc:description>  The increasing pervasiveness of internet-connected systems means that such
systems will continue to be exploited for criminal purposes by cybercriminals
(including malicious insiders such as employees and vendors). The importance of
protecting corporate system and intellectual property, and the escalating
complexities of the online environment underscore the need for ongoing
information security awareness and education training and the promotion of a
culture of security among employees. Two honeypots were deployed at a private
university based in Singapore. Findings from the analysis of the honeypot data
are presented in this paper. This paper then examines how analysis of honeypot
data can be used in employee information security awareness and education
training. Adapting the Routine Activity Theory, a criminology theory widely
used in the study of cybercrime, this paper proposes a conceptual Engaging
Stakeholders, Acceptable Behavior, Simple Teaching method, Yardstick (EASY)
training model, and explains how the model can be used to design employee
information security awareness and education training. Future research
directions are also outlined in this paper.

 <dc:description>  Mobile phones have been playing a very significant role in our daily
activities for the last decade. With the increase need for these devices,
people are now more reliant on their smartphone applications for their daily
tasks and many prefer to save their mobile data on a cloud platform to access
them anywhere on any device. Cloud technology is the new way for better data
storage, as it offers better security, more flexibility, and mobility. Many
smartphones have been investigated as subjects, objects or tools of the crime.
Many of these investigations include analysing data stored through cloud
storage apps which contributes to importance of cloud apps forensics on mobile
devices. In this paper, various cloud Android applications are analysed using
the forensics tool XRY and a forensics taxonomy for investigation of these apps
is suggested. The proposed taxonomy reflects residual artefacts retrievable
from 31 different cloud applications. It is expected that the proposed taxonomy
and the forensic findings in this paper will assist future forensic
investigations involving cloud based storage applications.

 <dc:description>  Before reaching full autonomy, vehicles will gradually be equipped with more
and more advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), effectively rendering them
semi-autonomous. However, current ADAS technologies seem unable to handle
complex traffic situations, notably when dealing with vehicles arriving from
the sides, either at intersections or when merging on highways. The high rate
of accidents in these settings prove that they constitute difficult driving
situations. Moreover, intersections and merging lanes are often the source of
important traffic congestion and, sometimes, deadlocks. In this article, we
propose a cooperative framework to safely coordinate semi-autonomous vehicles
in such settings, removing the risk of collision or deadlocks while remaining
compatible with human driving. More specifically, we present a supervised
coordination scheme that overrides control inputs from human drivers when they
would result in an unsafe or blocked situation. To avoid unnecessary
intervention and remain compatible with human driving, overriding only occurs
when collisions or deadlocks are imminent. In this case, safe overriding
controls are chosen while ensuring they deviate minimally from those originally
requested by the drivers. Simulation results based on a realistic physics
simulator show that our approach is scalable to real-world scenarios, and
computations can be performed in real-time on a standard computer for up to a
dozen simultaneous vehicles.

 <dc:description>  This paper uses a scenario-based role-play experiment based on the usage of
QR codes to detect how mobile users respond to social engineering attacks
conducted via mobile devices. The results of this experiment outline a guided
mobile phone forensics investigation method which could facilitate the work of
digital forensics investigators while analysing the data from mobile devices.
The behavioural response of users could be impacted by several aspects, such as
impulsivity, smartphone usage and security or simply awareness that QR codes
could contain malware. The findings indicate that the impulsivity of users is
one of the key areas that determine the common mistakes of mobile device users.
As a result, an investigative framework for mobile phone forensics is proposed
based on the impulsivity and common mistakes of mobile device users. As a
result, an investigative framework for mobile phone forensics is proposed based
on the impulsivity and common mistakes of mobile device users. It could help
the forensics investigators by potentially shortening the time spent on
investigation of possible breach scenarios.

 <dc:description>  We perform a systematic study in the computational complexity of the
connected variant of three related transversal problems: Vertex Cover, Feedback
Vertex Set, and Odd Cycle Transversal. Just like their original counterparts,
these variants are NP-complete for general graphs. A graph $G$ is $H$-free for
some graph $H$ if $G$ contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to $H$. It is
known that Connected Vertex Cover is NP-complete even for $H$-free graphs if
$H$ contains a claw or a cycle. We show that the two other connected variants
also remain NP-complete if $H$ contains a cycle or claw. In the remaining case
$H$ is a linear forest. We show that Connected Vertex Cover, Connected Feedback
Vertex Set, and Connected Odd Cycle Transversal are polynomial-time solvable
for $sP_2$-free graphs for every constant $s\geq 1$. For proving these results
we use known results on the price of connectivity for vertex cover, feedback
vertex set, and odd cycle transversal. This is the first application of the
price of connectivity that results in polynomial-time algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Development of mobile web-centric OS such as Firefox OS has created new
challenges, and opportunities for digital investigators. Network traffic
forensic plays an important role in cybercrime investigation to detect
subject(s) and object(s) of the crime. In this chapter, we detect and analyze
residual network traffic artefacts of Firefox OS in relation to two popular
social networking applications (Facebook and Twitter) and one instant messaging
application (Telegram). We utilized a Firefox OS simulator to generate relevant
traffic while all communication data were captured using network monitoring
tools. Captured network packets were examined and remnants with forensic value
were reported. This paper as the first focused study on mobile Firefox OS
network traffic analysis should pave the way for the future research in this
direction.

 <dc:description>  Mobile devices are increasingly utilized to access social media and instant
messaging services, which allow users to communicate with others easily and
quickly. However, the misuse of social media and instant messaging services
facilitated conducting different cybercrimes such as cyber stalking, cyber
bullying, slander spreading and sexual harassment. Therefore, mobile devices
are an important evidentiary piece in digital investigation. In this chapter,
we report the results of our investigation and analysis of social media and
instant messaging services in Firefox OS. We examined three social media
services (Facebook, Twitter and Google+) as well as three instant messaging
services (Telegram, OpenWapp and Line). Our analysis may pave the way for
future forensic investigators to trace and examine residual remnants of
forensics value in FireFox OS.

 <dc:description>  In domain adaptation, classifiers with information from a source domain adapt
to generalize to a target domain. However, an adaptive classifier can perform
worse than a non-adaptive classifier due to invalid assumptions, increased
sensitivity to estimation errors or model misspecification. Our goal is to
develop a domain-adaptive classifier that is robust in the sense that it does
not rely on restrictive assumptions on how the source and target domains relate
to each other and that it does not perform worse than the non-adaptive
classifier. We formulate a conservative parameter estimator that only deviates
from the source classifier when a lower risk is guaranteed for all possible
labellings of the given target samples. We derive the classical least-squares
and discriminant analysis cases and show that these perform on par with
state-of-the-art domain adaptive classifiers in sample selection bias settings,
while outperforming them in more general domain adaptation settings.

 <dc:description>  Wireless Multimedia Sensor Network (WMSN) is a promising technology capturing
rich multimedia data like audio and video, which can be useful to monitor an
environment under surveillance. However, many scenarios in real time monitoring
requires 3D depth information. In this research work, we propose to use the
disparity map that is computed from two or multiple images, in order to monitor
the depth information in an object or event under surveillance using WMSN. Our
system is based on distributed wireless sensors allowing us to notably reduce
the computational time needed for 3D depth reconstruction, thus permitting the
success of real time solutions. Each pair of sensors will capture images for a
targeted place/object and will operate a Stereo Matching in order to create a
Disparity Map. Disparity maps will give us the ability to decrease traffic on
the bandwidth, because they are of low size. This will increase WMSN lifetime.
Any event can be detected after computing the depth value for the target object
in the scene, and also 3D scene reconstruction can be achieved with a disparity
map and some reference(s) image(s) taken by the node(s).

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a toolbox for a specific optimization problem that
frequently arises in bioinformatics or genomics. In this specific optimisation
problem, the state space is a set of words of specified length over a finite
alphabet. To each word is associated a score. The overall objective is to find
the words which have the lowest possible score. This type of general
optimization problem is encountered in e.g 3D conformation optimisation for
protein structure prediction, or largest core genes subset discovery based on
best supported phylogenetic tree for a set of species. In order to solve this
problem, we propose a toolbox that can be easily launched using MPI and embeds
3 well-known metaheuristics. The toolbox is fully parametrized and well
documented. It has been specifically designed to be easy modified and possibly
improved by the user depending on the application, and does not require to be a
computer scientist. We show that the toolbox performs very well on two
difficult practical problems.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new count-based optimistic exploration algorithm for
Reinforcement Learning (RL) that is feasible in environments with
high-dimensional state-action spaces. The success of RL algorithms in these
domains depends crucially on generalisation from limited training experience.
Function approximation techniques enable RL agents to generalise in order to
estimate the value of unvisited states, but at present few methods enable
generalisation regarding uncertainty. This has prevented the combination of
scalable RL algorithms with efficient exploration strategies that drive the
agent to reduce its uncertainty. We present a new method for computing a
generalised state visit-count, which allows the agent to estimate the
uncertainty associated with any state. Our \phi-pseudocount achieves
generalisation by exploiting same feature representation of the state space
that is used for value function approximation. States that have less frequently
observed features are deemed more uncertain. The \phi-Exploration-Bonus
algorithm rewards the agent for exploring in feature space rather than in the
untransformed state space. The method is simpler and less computationally
expensive than some previous proposals, and achieves near state-of-the-art
results on high-dimensional RL benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Sub-categories of mathematical topology, like the mathematical theory of
chaos, offer interesting applications devoted to information security. In this
research work, we have introduced a new chaos-based pseudorandom number
generator implemented in FPGA, which is mainly based on the deletion of a
Hamilton cycle within the $n$-cube (or on the vectorial negation), plus one
single permutation. By doing so, we produce a kind of post-treatment on
hardware pseudorandom generators, but the obtained generator has usually a
better statistical profile than its input, while running at a similar speed. We
tested 6 combinations of Boolean functions and strategies that all achieve to
pass the most stringent TestU01 battery of tests. This generation can reach a
throughput/latency ratio equal to 6.7 Gbps, being thus the second fastest FPGA
generator that can pass TestU01.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With an exponentially growing number of scientific papers published each
year, advanced tools for exploring and discovering publications of interest are
becoming indispensable. To empower users beyond a simple keyword search
provided e.g. by Google Scholar, we present the novel web application PubVis.
Powered by a variety of machine learning techniques, it combines essential
features to help researchers find the content most relevant to them. An
interactive visualization of a large collection of scientific publications
provides an overview of the field and encourages the user to explore articles
beyond a narrow research focus. This is augmented by personalized content based
article recommendations as well as an advanced full text search to discover
relevant references. The open sourced implementation of the app can be easily
set up and run locally on a desktop computer to provide access to content
tailored to the specific needs of individual users. Additionally, a PubVis demo
with access to a collection of 10,000 papers can be tested online.

 <dc:title>Merging real and virtual worlds: An analysis of the state of the art and

 <dc:description>  Achieving a symbiotic blending between reality and virtuality is a dream that
has been lying in the minds of many people for a long time. Advances in various
domains constantly bring us closer to making that dream come true. Augmented
reality as well as virtual reality are in fact trending terms and are expected
to further progress in the years to come.
  This master's thesis aims to explore these areas and starts by defining
necessary terms such as augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR). Usual
taxonomies to classify and compare the corresponding experiences are then
discussed.
  In order to enable those applications, many technical challenges need to be
tackled, such as accurate motion tracking with 6 degrees of freedom (positional
and rotational), that is necessary for compelling experiences and to prevent
user sickness. Additionally, augmented reality experiences typically rely on
image processing to position the superimposed content. To do so, &quot;paper&quot;
markers or features extracted from the environment are often employed. Both
sets of techniques are explored and common solutions and algorithms are
presented.
  After investigating those technical aspects, I carry out an objective
comparison of the existing state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice in those
domains, and I discuss present and potential applications in these areas. As a
practical validation, I present the results of an application that I have
developed using Microsoft HoloLens, one of the more advanced affordable
technologies for augmented reality that is available today. Based on the
experience and lessons learned during this development, I discuss the
limitations of current technologies and present some avenues of future
research.

 <dc:title>Flexible Rectified Linear Units for Improving Convolutional Neural

 <dc:description>  Rectified linear unit (ReLU) is a widely used activation function for deep
convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel activation
function called flexible rectified linear unit (FReLU). FReLU improves the
flexibility of ReLU by a learnable rectified point. FReLU achieves a faster
convergence and higher performance. Furthermore, FReLU does not rely on strict
assumptions by self-adaption. FReLU is also simple and effective without using
exponential function. We evaluate FReLU on two standard image classification
dataset, including CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Experimental results show the
strengths of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of encryption was invented in 1976, and
it is currently one of the most commonly used mode. In our previous research
works, we have proven that the CBC mode of operation exhibits, under some
conditions, a chaotic behavior. The dynamics of this mode has been deeply
investigated later, both qualitatively and quantitatively, using the rigorous
mathematical topology field of research. In this article, which is an extension
of our previous work, we intend to compute a new important quantitative
property concerning our chaotic CBC mode of operation, which is the Lyapunov
exponent.

 <dc:title>Specifying Non-Markovian Rewards in MDPs Using LDL on Finite Traces

 <dc:description>  In Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), the reward obtained in a state depends
on the properties of the last state and action. This state dependency makes it
difficult to reward more interesting long-term behaviors, such as always
closing a door after it has been opened, or providing coffee only following a
request. Extending MDPs to handle such non-Markovian reward function was the
subject of two previous lines of work, both using variants of LTL to specify
the reward function and then compiling the new model back into a Markovian
model. Building upon recent progress in the theories of temporal logics over
finite traces, we adopt LDLf for specifying non-Markovian rewards and provide
an elegant automata construction for building a Markovian model, which extends
that of previous work and offers strong minimality and compositionality
guarantees.

 <dc:description>  Investigating how to construct a secure hash algorithm needs in-depth study,
as various existing hash functions like the MD5 algorithm have recently exposed
their security flaws. At the same time, hash function based on chaotic theory
has become an emerging research in the field of nonlinear information security.
As an extension of our previous research works, a new chaotic iterations keyed
hash function is proposed in this article. Chaotic iterations are used both to
construct strategies with pseudorandom number generator and to calculate new
hash values using classical hash functions. It is shown that, by doing so, it
is possible to apply a kind of post-treatment on existing hash algorithms,
which preserves their security properties while adding Devaney's chaos.
Security performance analysis of such a post-treatment are finally provided.

 <dc:description>  Counting interior-disjoint empty convex polygons in a point set is a typical
Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres-type problem. We study this problem for 4-gons. Let $P$ be a
set of $n$ points in the plane and in general position. A subset $Q$ of $P$
with four points is called a $4$-hole in $P$ if the convex hull of $Q$ is a
quadrilateral and does not contain any point of $P$ in its interior. Two
4-holes in $P$ are compatible if their interiors are disjoint. We show that $P$
contains at least $\lfloor 5n/11\rfloor {-} 1$ pairwise compatible 4-holes.
This improves the lower bound of $2\lfloor(n-2)/5\rfloor$ which is implied by a
result of Sakai and Urrutia (2007).

 <dc:description>  In this paper, random forests are proposed for operating devices diagnostics
in the presence of a variable number of features. In various contexts, like
large or difficult-to-access monitored areas, wired sensor networks providing
features to achieve diagnostics are either very costly to use or totally
impossible to spread out. Using a wireless sensor network can solve this
problem, but this latter is more subjected to flaws. Furthermore, the networks'
topology often changes, leading to a variability in quality of coverage in the
targeted area. Diagnostics at the sink level must take into consideration that
both the number and the quality of the provided features are not constant, and
that some politics like scheduling or data aggregation may be developed across
the network. The aim of this article is ($1$) to show that random forests are
relevant in this context, due to their flexibility and robustness, and ($2$) to
provide first examples of use of this method for diagnostics based on data
provided by a wireless sensor network.

 <dc:description>  In recent years a growing interest on action recognition is observed,
including detection of fall accident for the elderly. However, despite many
efforts undertaken, the existing technology is not widely used by elderly,
mainly because of its flaws like low precision, large number of false alarms,
inadequate privacy preserving during data acquisition and processing. This
research work meets these expectations. The work is empirical and it is
situated in the field of computer vision systems. The main part of the work
situates itself in the area of action and behavior recognition. Efficient
algorithms for fall detection were developed, tested and implemented using
image sequences and wireless inertial sensor worn by a monitored person. A set
of descriptors for depth maps has been elaborated to permit classification of
pose as well as the action of a person. Experimental research was carried out
based on the prepared data repository consisting of synchronized depth and
accelerometric data. The study was carried out in the scenario with a static
camera facing the scene and an active camera observing the scene from above.
The experimental results showed that the developed algorithms for fall
detection have high sensitivity and specificity. The algorithm were designed
with regard to low computational demands and possibility to run on ARM
platforms. Several experiments including person detection, tracking and fall
detection in real-time were carried out to show efficiency and reliability of
the proposed solutions.

the involutions acting fixed point freely, we show that also automorphisms of
order 8 cannot occur and the automorphism group is of order at most 120, with
further restrictions. Finally, we present some necessary conditions for the
existence of the code, based on shadow and design theory.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the Steiner point removal (SPR) problem, we are given a weighted graph
$G=(V,E)$ and a set of terminals $K\subset V$ of size $k$. The objective is to
find a minor $M$ of $G$ with only the terminals as its vertex set, such that
the distance between the terminals will be preserved up to a small
multiplicative distortion. Kamma, Krauthgamer and Nguyen [KKN15] used a
ball-growing algorithm with exponential distributions to show that the
distortion is at most $O(\log^5 k)$. Cheung [Che17] improved the analysis of
the same algorithm, bounding the distortion by $O(\log^2 k)$. We improve the
analysis of this ball-growing algorithm even further, bounding the distortion
by $O(\log k)$.

 <dc:description>  Brain tumour segmentation plays a key role in computer-assisted surgery. Deep
neural networks have increased the accuracy of automatic segmentation
significantly, however these models tend to generalise poorly to different
imaging modalities than those for which they have been designed, thereby
limiting their applications. For example, a network architecture initially
designed for brain parcellation of monomodal T1 MRI can not be easily
translated into an efficient tumour segmentation network that jointly utilises
T1, T1c, Flair and T2 MRI. To tackle this, we propose a novel scalable
multimodal deep learning architecture using new nested structures that
explicitly leverage deep features within or across modalities. This aims at
making the early layers of the architecture structured and sparse so that the
final architecture becomes scalable to the number of modalities. We evaluate
the scalable architecture for brain tumour segmentation and give evidence of
its regularisation effect compared to the conventional concatenation approach.

 <dc:description>  Real-time tool segmentation from endoscopic videos is an essential part of
many computer-assisted robotic surgical systems and of critical importance in
robotic surgical data science. We propose two novel deep learning architectures
for automatic segmentation of non-rigid surgical instruments. Both methods take
advantage of automated deep-learning-based multi-scale feature extraction while
trying to maintain an accurate segmentation quality at all resolutions. The two
proposed methods encode the multi-scale constraint inside the network
architecture. The first proposed architecture enforces it by cascaded
aggregation of predictions and the second proposed network does it by means of
a holistically-nested architecture where the loss at each scale is taken into
account for the optimization process. As the proposed methods are for real-time
semantic labeling, both present a reduced number of parameters. We propose the
use of parametric rectified linear units for semantic labeling in these small
architectures to increase the regularization ability of the design and maintain
the segmentation accuracy without overfitting the training sets. We compare the
proposed architectures against state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks.
We validate our methods using existing benchmark datasets, including ex vivo
cases with phantom tissue and different robotic surgical instruments present in
the scene. Our results show a statistically significant improved Dice
Similarity Coefficient over previous instrument segmentation methods. We
analyze our design choices and discuss the key drivers for improving accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Maintenance is an important activity in industry. It is performed either to
revive a machine/component or to prevent it from breaking down. Different
strategies have evolved through time, bringing maintenance to its current
state: condition-based and predictive maintenances. This evolution was due to
the increasing demand of reliability in industry. The key process of
condition-based and predictive maintenances is prognostics and health
management, and it is a tool to predict the remaining useful life of
engineering assets. Nowadays, plants are required to avoid shutdowns while
offering safety and reliability. Nevertheless, planning a maintenance activity
requires accurate information about the system/component health state. Such
information is usually gathered by means of independent sensor nodes. In this
study, we consider the case where the nodes are interconnected and form a
wireless sensor network. As far as we know, no research work has considered
such a case of study for prognostics. Regarding the importance of data
accuracy, a good prognostics requires reliable sources of information. This is
why, in this paper, we will first discuss the dependability of wireless sensor
networks, and then present a state of the art in prognostic and health
management activities.

 <dc:description>  Wireless sensor networks are often deployed in public or otherwise untrusted
and even hostile environments, which prompts a number of security issues.
Although security is a necessity in other types of networks, it is much more so
in sensor networks due to the resource-constraint, susceptibility to physical
capture, and wireless nature. In this work we emphasize two security issues:
(1) secure communication infrastructure and (2) secure nodes scheduling
algorithm. Due to resource constraints, specific strategies are often necessary
to preserve the network's lifetime and its quality of service. For instance, to
reduce communication costs nodes can go to sleep mode periodically (nodes
scheduling). These strategies must be proven as secure, but protocols used to
guarantee this security must be compatible with the resource preservation
requirement. To achieve this goal, secure communications in such networks will
be defined, together with the notions of secure scheduling. Finally, some of
these security properties will be evaluated in concrete case studies.

 <dc:description>  A wireless sensor network (WSN) typically consists of base stations and a
large number of wireless sensors. The sensory data gathered from the whole
network at a certain time snapshot can be visualized as an image. As a result,
information hiding techniques can be applied to this &quot;sensory data image&quot;.
Steganography refers to the technology of hiding data into digital media
without drawing any suspicion, while steganalysis is the art of detecting the
presence of steganography. This article provides a brief review of
steganography and steganalysis applications for wireless sensor networks
(WSNs). Then we show that the steganographic techniques are both related to
sensed data authentication in wireless sensor networks, and when considering
the attacker point of view, which has not yet been investigated in the
literature. Our simulation results show that the sink level is unable to detect
an attack carried out by the nsF5 algorithm on sensed data.

 <dc:description>  We propose a simple and efficient approach to learning sparse models. Our
approach consists of (1) projecting the data into a lower dimensional space,
(2) learning a dense model in the lower dimensional space, and then (3)
recovering the sparse model in the original space via compressive sensing. We
apply this approach to Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), tensor
decomposition and linear classification---showing that it obtains $10\times$
compression with negligible loss in accuracy on real data, and obtains up to
$5\times$ speedups. Our main theoretical contribution is to show the following
result for NMF: if the original factors are sparse, then their projections are
the sparsest solutions to the projected NMF problem. This explains why our
method works for NMF and shows an interesting new property of random
projections: they can preserve the solutions of non-convex optimization
problems such as NMF.

 <dc:description>  We analyze the revenue loss due to market shrinkage. Specifically, consider a
simple market with one item for sale and $n$ bidders whose values are drawn
from some joint distribution. Suppose that the market shrinks as a single
bidder retires from the market. Suppose furthermore that the value of this
retiring bidder is fixed and always strictly smaller than the values of the
other players. We show that even this slight decrease in competition might
cause a significant fall of a multiplicative factor of
$\frac{1}{e+1}\approx0.268$ in the revenue that can be obtained by a dominant
strategy ex-post individually rational mechanism.
  In particular, our results imply a solution to an open question that was
posed by Dobzinski, Fu, and Kleinberg [STOC'11].

 <dc:description>  Photometric Stereo methods seek to reconstruct the 3d shape of an object from
motionless images obtained with varying illumination. Most existing methods
solve a restricted problem where the physical reflectance model, such as
Lambertian reflectance, is known in advance. In contrast, we do not restrict
ourselves to a specific reflectance model. Instead, we offer a method that
works on a wide variety of reflectances. Our approach uses a simple yet
uncommonly used property of the problem - the sought after normals are points
on a unit hemisphere. We present a novel embedding method that maps pixels to
normals on the unit hemisphere. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach
outperforms existing manifold learning methods for the task of hemisphere
embedding. We further show successful reconstructions of objects from a wide
variety of reflectances including smooth, rough, diffuse and specular surfaces,
even in the presence of significant attached shadows. Finally, we empirically
prove that under these challenging settings we obtain more accurate shape
reconstructions than existing methods.

 <dc:description>  Word embeddings, which represent a word as a point in a vector space, have
become ubiquitous to several NLP tasks. A recent line of work uses bilingual
(two languages) corpora to learn a different vector for each sense of a word,
by exploiting crosslingual signals to aid sense identification. We present a
multi-view Bayesian non-parametric algorithm which improves multi-sense word
embeddings by (a) using multilingual (i.e., more than two languages) corpora to
significantly improve sense embeddings beyond what one achieves with bilingual
information, and (b) uses a principled approach to learn a variable number of
senses per word, in a data-driven manner. Ours is the first approach with the
ability to leverage multilingual corpora efficiently for multi-sense
representation learning. Experiments show that multilingual training
significantly improves performance over monolingual and bilingual training, by
allowing us to combine different parallel corpora to leverage multilingual
context. Multilingual training yields comparable performance to a state of the
art mono-lingual model trained on five times more training data.

 <dc:description>  The practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) urges medical practitioners to
utilise the latest research evidence when making clinical decisions. Because of
the massive and growing volume of published research on various medical topics,
practitioners often find themselves overloaded with information. As such,
natural language processing research has recently commenced exploring
techniques for performing medical domain-specific automated text summarisation
(ATS) techniques-- targeted towards the task of condensing large medical texts.
However, the development of effective summarisation techniques for this task
requires cross-domain knowledge. We present a survey of EBM, the
domain-specific needs for EBM, automated summarisation techniques, and how they
have been applied hitherto. We envision that this survey will serve as a first
resource for the development of future operational text summarisation
techniques for EBM.

 <dc:title>Strong Converses Are Just Edge Removal Properties</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kosut, Oliver</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kliewer, Joerg</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper explores the relationship between two ideas in network information
theory: edge removal and strong converses. Edge removal properties state that
if an edge of small capacity is removed from a network, the capacity region
does not change too much. Strong converses state that, for rates outside the
capacity region, the probability of error converges to 1. Various notions of
edge removal and strong converse are defined, depending on how edge capacity
and residual error probability scale with blocklength, and relations between
them are proved. In particular, each class of strong converse implies a
specific class of edge removal. The opposite directions are proved for
deterministic networks. Furthermore, a technique based on a novel, causal
version of the blowing-up lemma is used to prove that for discrete memoryless
stationary networks, the weak edge removal property---that the capacity region
changes continuously as the capacity of an edge vanishes---is equivalent to the
exponentially strong converse---that outside the capacity region, the
probability of error goes to 1 exponentially fast. This result is used to prove
exponentially strong converses for several examples---including the cut-set
bound and the discrete 2-user interference channel with strong
interference---with only a small variation from traditional weak converse
proofs.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a computer-based recursion algorithm for automatic charge
of power device of electric vehicles carrying electromagnet. The charging
system includes charging cable with one end connecting gang socket,
electromagnetic gear driving the connecting socket and a charging pile breaking
or closing, and detecting part for detecting electric vehicle static call or
start state. The gang socket mentioned above is linked to electromagnetic gear,
and the detecting part is connected with charging management system containing
the intelligent charging power module which controls the electromagnetic drive
action to close socket with a charging pile at static state and to break at
start state. Our work holds an electric automobile with convenience, safety low
maintenance cost.

 <dc:title>Detecting Integrity Attacks on Control Systems using a Moving Target
  Approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Weerakkody, Sean</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sinopoli, Bruno</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Maintaining the security of control systems in the presence of integrity
attacks is a significant challenge. In literature, several possible attacks
against control systems have been formulated including replay, false data
injection, and zero dynamics attacks. The detection and prevention of these
attacks may require the defender to possess a particular subset of trusted
communication channels. Alternatively, these attacks can be prevented by
keeping the system model secret from the adversary. In this paper, we consider
an adversary who has the ability to modify and read all sensor and actuator
channels. To thwart this adversary, we introduce external states dependent on
the state of the control system, with linear time-varying dynamics unknown to
the adversary. We also include sensors to measure these states. The presence of
unknown time-varying dynamics is leveraged to detect an adversary who
simultaneously aims to identify the system and inject stealthy outputs.
Potential attack strategies and bounds on the attacker's performance are
provided.

employ the new interface to collect dense recommender datasets that will
complement existing sparse industry-scale datasets. The new interface and the
collected datasets are intended to foster integration of research in
recommender systems with research in social and behavioral sciences. For
instance, we will use the datasets to assess the diversity of human preferences
in different domains of visual experience. Further, using the datasets we will
be able to measure crucial psychological effects, such as preference

 <dc:title>Automatic Synonym Discovery with Knowledge Bases</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recognizing entity synonyms from text has become a crucial task in many
entity-leveraging applications. However, discovering entity synonyms from
domain-specific text corpora (e.g., news articles, scientific papers) is rather
challenging. Current systems take an entity name string as input to find out
other names that are synonymous, ignoring the fact that often times a name
string can refer to multiple entities (e.g., &quot;apple&quot; could refer to both Apple
Inc and the fruit apple). Moreover, most existing methods require training data
manually created by domain experts to construct supervised-learning systems. In
this paper, we study the problem of automatic synonym discovery with knowledge
bases, that is, identifying synonyms for knowledge base entities in a given
domain-specific corpus. The manually-curated synonyms for each entity stored in
a knowledge base not only form a set of name strings to disambiguate the
meaning for each other, but also can serve as &quot;distant&quot; supervision to help
determine important features for the task. We propose a novel framework, called
DPE, to integrate two kinds of mutually-complementing signals for synonym
discovery, i.e., distributional features based on corpus-level statistics and
textual patterns based on local contexts. In particular, DPE jointly optimizes
the two kinds of signals in conjunction with distant supervision, so that they
can mutually enhance each other in the training stage. At the inference stage,
both signals will be utilized to discover synonyms for the given entities.
Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

 <dc:title>Robust Video-Based Eye Tracking Using Recursive Estimation of Pupil
  Characteristics</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Brouns, Terence</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Video-based eye tracking is a valuable technique in various research fields.
Numerous open-source eye tracking algorithms have been developed in recent
years, primarily designed for general application with many different camera
types. These algorithms do not, however, capitalize on the high frame rate of
eye tracking cameras often employed in psychophysical studies. We present a
pupil detection method that utilizes this high-speed property to obtain
reliable predictions through recursive estimation about certain pupil
characteristics in successive camera frames. These predictions are subsequently
used to carry out novel image segmentation and classification routines to
improve pupil detection performance. Based on results from hand-labelled eye
images, our approach was found to have a greater detection rate, accuracy and
speed compared to other recently published open-source pupil detection
algorithms. The program's source code, together with a graphical user
interface, can be downloaded at https://github.com/tbrouns/eyestalker

 <dc:description>  Neural machine translation (NMT) has recently become popular in the field of
machine translation. However, NMT suffers from the problem of repeating or
missing words in the translation. To address this problem, Tu et al. (2017)
proposed an encoder-decoder-reconstructor framework for NMT using
back-translation. In this method, they selected the best forward translation
model in the same manner as Bahdanau et al. (2015), and then trained a
bi-directional translation model as fine-tuning. Their experiments show that it
offers significant improvement in BLEU scores in Chinese-English translation
task. We confirm that our re-implementation also shows the same tendency and
alleviates the problem of repeating and missing words in the translation on a
English-Japanese task too. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of
pre-training by comparing it with a jointly-trained model of forward
translation and back-translation.

 <dc:description>  It was recently conjectured by Vivo, Pato, and Oshanin [Phys. Rev. E 93,
052106 (2016)] that for a quantum system of Hilbert dimension $mn$ in a pure
state, the variance of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of dimension
$m\leq n$ is given by \begin{equation*}
-\psi_{1}\left(mn+1\right)+\frac{m+n}{mn+1}\psi_{1}\left(n\right)-\frac{(m+1)(m+2n+1)}{4n^{2}(mn+1)},
\end{equation*} where $\psi_{1}(\cdot)$ is the trigamma function. We give a
proof of this formula.

 <dc:description>  Variance reduction (VR) algorithms for convergence acceleration of stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) have been developed with great efforts recently. Its two
variants, stochastic variance-reduced-gradient (SVRG) and importance sampling
(IS) have achieved impressive progresses. Meanwhile, asynchronous SGD (ASGD) is
becoming more important due to the ever-increasing scale of optimization
problems and thus applying VR in ASGD to accelerate its convergence procedure
has attracted lots of researches. Unlike well-studied SVRG-styled VR algorithms
which need at least double computation cost per iteration and periodical
computation of the true gradient, IS achieves improved convergence bound with
no extra on-line computation. This advantage makes it very suitable for ASGD
which targeting at the best performance and scalability. In considering the
fact that the research of applying IS in ASGD is still missing, this paper
studies the application of IS in ASGD for efficient variance reduction, namely,
IS-ASGD algorithm. We prove in theoretical that IS-ASGD achieves superior
convergence bound than ASGD which accelerates the training significantly in
practical deployment. The experimental evaluation conducted validates the
effectiveness of IS-ASGD. We also make our evaluation source code accessible
publicly on github.

 <dc:description>  We propose an image based end-to-end learning framework that helps
lane-change decisions for human drivers and autonomous vehicles. The proposed
system, Safe Lane-Change Aid Network (SLCAN), trains a deep convolutional
neural network to classify the status of adjacent lanes from rear view images
acquired by cameras mounted on both sides of the vehicle. Rather than depending
on any explicit object detection or tracking scheme, SLCAN reads the whole
input image and directly decides whether initiation of the lane-change at the
moment is safe or not. We collected and annotated 77,273 rear side view images
to train and test SLCAN. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
achieves 96.98% classification accuracy although the test images are from
unseen roadways. We also visualize the saliency map to understand which part of
image SLCAN looks at for correct decisions.

 <dc:description>  Large-scale datasets have played a significant role in progress of neural
network and deep learning areas. YouTube-8M is such a benchmark dataset for
general multi-label video classification. It was created from over 7 million
YouTube videos (450,000 hours of video) and includes video labels from a
vocabulary of 4716 classes (3.4 labels/video on average). It also comes with
pre-extracted audio &amp; visual features from every second of video (3.2 billion
feature vectors in total). Google cloud recently released the datasets and
organized 'Google Cloud &amp; YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge' on Kaggle.
Competitors are challenged to develop classification algorithms that assign
video-level labels using the new and improved Youtube-8M V2 dataset. Inspired
by the competition, we started exploration of audio understanding and
classification using deep learning algorithms and ensemble methods. We built
several baseline predictions according to the benchmark paper and public github
tensorflow code. Furthermore, we improved global prediction accuracy (GAP) from
base level 77% to 80.7% through approaches of ensemble.

corresponds to a spatialtemporal video tube that potentially locates one human
action. Our method consists of a recurrent YoTube detector and a static YoTube
detector, where the recurrent YoTube explores the regression capability of RNN
for candidate bounding boxes predictions using learnt temporal dynamics and the
static YoTube produces the bounding boxes using rich appearance cues in a
single frame. Both networks are trained using rgb and optical flow in order to
fully exploit the rich appearance, motion and temporal context, and their
outputs are fused to produce accurate and robust proposal boxes. Action
proposals are finally constructed by linking these boxes using dynamic
programming with a novel trimming method to handle the untrimmed video
effectively and efficiently. Extensive experiments on the challenging UCF-101
and UCF-Sports datasets show that our proposed technique obtains superior
performance compared with the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  The problem of dividing resources fairly occurs in many practical situations
and is therefore an important topic of study in economics. In this paper, we
investigate envy-free divisions in the setting where there are multiple players
in each interested party. While all players in a party share the same set of
resources, each player has her own preferences. Under additive valuations drawn
randomly from probability distributions, we show that when all groups contain
an equal number of players, a welfare-maximizing allocation is likely to be
envy-free if the number of items exceeds the total number of players by a
logarithmic factor. On the other hand, an envy-free allocation is unlikely to
exist if the number of items is less than the total number of players. In
addition, we show that a simple truthful mechanism, namely the random
assignment mechanism, yields an allocation that satisfies the weaker notion of
approximate envy-freeness with high probability.

 <dc:title>Do GANs actually learn the distribution? An empirical study</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Do GANS (Generative Adversarial Nets) actually learn the target distribution?
The foundational paper of (Goodfellow et al 2014) suggested they do, if they
were given sufficiently large deep nets, sample size, and computation time. A
recent theoretical analysis in Arora et al (to appear at ICML 2017) raised
doubts whether the same holds when discriminator has finite size. It showed
that the training objective can approach its optimum value even if the
generated distribution has very low support ---in other words, the training
objective is unable to prevent mode collapse. The current note reports
experiments suggesting that such problems are not merely theoretical. It
presents empirical evidence that well-known GANs approaches do learn
distributions of fairly low support, and thus presumably are not learning the
target distribution. The main technical contribution is a new proposed test,
based upon the famous birthday paradox, for estimating the support size of the
generated distribution.

 <dc:description>  The revolutionary developments in the field of supervised machine learning
have paved way to the development of CAD tools for assisting doctors in
diagnosis. Recently, the former has been employed in the prediction of
neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. We propose a CAD (Computer
Aided Diagnosis tool for differentiating neural lesions caused by CVA
(Cerebrovascular Accident) from the lesions caused by other neural disorders by
using Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) and Haralick features for feature
extraction and SVM (Support Vector Machine) for pattern recognition. We also
introduce a multi-level classification system that has better classification
efficiency, sensitivity and specificity when compared to systems using NMF or
Haralick features alone as features for classification. Cross-validation was
performed using LOOCV (Leave-One-Out Cross Validation) method and our proposed
system has a classification accuracy of over 86%.

 <dc:title>Between Homomorphic Signal Processing and Deep Neural Networks:
  Constructing Deep Algorithms for Polyphonic Music Transcription</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new approach in understanding how deep neural networks
(DNNs) work by applying homomorphic signal processing techniques. Focusing on
the task of multi-pitch estimation (MPE), this paper demonstrates the
equivalence relation between a generalized cepstrum and a DNN in terms of their
structures and functionality. Such an equivalence relation, together with pitch
perception theories and the recently established
rectified-correlations-on-a-sphere (RECOS) filter analysis, provide an
alternative way in explaining the role of the nonlinear activation function and
the multi-layer structure, both of which exist in a cepstrum and a DNN. To
validate the efficacy of this new approach, a new feature designed in the same
fashion is proposed for pitch salience function. The new feature outperforms
the one-layer spectrum in the MPE task and, as predicted, it addresses the
issue of the missing fundamental effect and also achieves better robustness to
noise.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study object detection using a large pool of unlabeled
images and only a few labeled images per category, named &quot;few-shot object
detection&quot;. The key challenge consists in generating trustworthy training
samples as many as possible from the pool. Using few training examples as
seeds, our method iterates between model training and high-confidence sample
selection. In training, easy samples are generated first and, then the poorly
initialized model undergoes improvement. As the model becomes more
discriminative, challenging but reliable samples are selected. After that,
another round of model improvement takes place. To further improve the
precision and recall of the generated training samples, we embed multiple
detection models in our framework, which has proven to outperform the single
model baseline and the model ensemble method. Experiments on PASCAL VOC'07
indicate that by using as few as three or four samples selected for each
category, our method produces very competitive results when compared to the
state-of-the-art weakly-supervised approaches using a large number of
image-level labels.

 <dc:description>  Business process models describe the way of working in an organization.
Typically, business process models distinguish between the normal flow of work
and exceptions to that normal flow. However, they often present an idealized
view. This means that unexpected exceptions - exceptions that are not modelled
in the business process model - can also occur in practice. This has an effect
on the efficiency of the organization, because information systems are not
developed to handle unexpected exceptions. This paper studies the relation
between the occurrence of exceptions and operational performance. It does this
by analyzing the execution logs of business processes from five organizations,
classifying execution paths as normal or exceptional. Subsequently, it analyzes
the differences between normal and exceptional paths. The results show that
exceptions are related to worse operational performance in terms of a longer
throughput time and that unexpected exceptions relate to a stronger increase in
throughput time than expected exceptions.

 <dc:description>  The execution logs that are used for process mining in practice are often
obtained by querying an operational database and storing the result in a flat
file. Consequently, the data processing power of the database system cannot be
used anymore for this information, leading to constrained flexibility in the
definition of mining patterns and limited execution performance in mining large
logs. Enabling process mining directly on a database - instead of via
intermediate storage in a flat file - therefore provides additional flexibility
and efficiency. To help facilitate this ideal of in-database process mining,
this paper formally defines a database operator that extracts the 'directly
follows' relation from an operational database. This operator can both be used
to do in-database process mining and to flexibly evaluate process mining
related queries, such as: &quot;which employee most frequently changes the 'amount'
attribute of a case from one task to the next&quot;. We define the operator using
the well-known relational algebra that forms the formal underpinning of
relational databases. We formally prove equivalence properties of the operator
that are useful for query optimization and present time-complexity properties
of the operator. By doing so this paper formally defines the necessary
relational algebraic elements of a 'directly follows' operator, which are
required for implementation of such an operator in a DBMS.

 <dc:title>Deep Semantics-Aware Photo Adjustment</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Automatic photo adjustment is to mimic the photo retouching style of
professional photographers and automatically adjust photos to the learned
style. There have been many attempts to model the tone and the color adjustment
globally with low-level color statistics. Also, spatially varying photo
adjustment methods have been studied by exploiting high-level features and
semantic label maps. Those methods are semantics-aware since the color mapping
is dependent on the high-level semantic context. However, their performance is
limited to the pre-computed hand-crafted features and it is hard to reflect
user's preference to the adjustment. In this paper, we propose a deep neural
network that models the semantics-aware photo adjustment. The proposed network
exploits bilinear models that are the multiplicative interaction of the color
and the contexual features. As the contextual features we propose the semantic
adjustment map, which discovers the inherent photo retouching presets that are
applied according to the scene context. The proposed method is trained using a
robust loss with a scene parsing task. The experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms the existing method both quantitatively and
qualitatively. The proposed method also provides users a way to retouch the
photo by their own likings by giving customized adjustment maps.

 <dc:description>  NURBS curve is widely used in Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided
Geometric Design. When a single weight approaches infinity, the limit of a
NURBS curve tends to the corresponding control point. In this paper, a kind of
control structure of a NURBS curve, called regular control curve, is defined.
We prove that the limit of the NURBS curve is exactly its regular control curve
when all of weights approach infinity, where each weight is multiplied by a
certain one-parameter function tending to infinity, different for each control
point. Moreover, some representative examples are presented to show this
property and indicate its application for shape deformation.

 <dc:description>  Every rational number p/q defines a rational base numeration system in which
every integer has a unique finite representation, up to leading zeroes. This
work is a contribution to the study of the set of the representations of
integers. This prefix-closed subset of the free monoid is naturally represented
as a highly non-regular tree. Its nodes are the integers, its edges bear labels
taken in {0,1,...,p-1}, and its subtrees are all distinct.
  We associate with each subtree (or with its root n) three infinite words. The
bottom word of n is the lexicographically smallest word that is the label of a
branch of the subtree. The top word of n is defined similarly. The span-word of
n is the digitwise difference between the latter and the former.
  First, we show that the set of all the span-words is accepted by an infinite
automaton whose underlying graph is essentially the same as the tree itself.
Second, we study the function that computes for all n the bottom word
associated with n+1 from the one associated with n, and show that it is
realised by an infinite sequential transducer whose underlying graph is once
again essentially the same as the tree itself.
  An infinite word may be interpreted as an expansion in base p/q after the
radix point, hence evaluated to a real number. If T is a subtree whose root is
n, then the evaluations of the labels of the branches of T form an interval of
$\mathbb{R}$. The length of this interval is called the span of n and is equal
to the evaluation of the span-word of n. The set of all spans is then a subset
of R and we use the preceding construction to study its topological closure. We
show that it is an interval when p is greater than or equal to 2q-1, and a
Cantor set of measure zero otherwise.

 <dc:description>  We study statistical model checking of continuous-time stochastic hybrid
systems. The challenge in applying statistical model checking to these systems
is that one cannot simulate such systems exactly. We employ the multilevel
Monte Carlo method (MLMC) and work on a sequence of discrete-time stochastic
processes whose executions approximate and converge weakly to that of the
original continuous-time stochastic hybrid system with respect to satisfaction
of the property of interest. With focus on bounded-horizon reachability, we
recast the model checking problem as the computation of the distribution of the
exit time, which is in turn formulated as the expectation of an indicator
function. This latter computation involves estimating discontinuous
functionals, which reduces the bound on the convergence rate of the Monte Carlo
algorithm. We propose a smoothing step with tunable precision and formally
quantify the error of the MLMC approach in the mean-square sense, which is
composed of smoothing error, bias, and variance. We formulate a general
adaptive algorithm which balances these error terms. Finally, we describe an
application of our technique to verify a model of thermostatically controlled
loads.

 <dc:description>  Self-adaptive software is considered as the most advanced approach and its
development attracts a lot of attention. Decentralization is an effective way
to design and manage the complexity of modern self-adaptive software systems.
However, there are still tremendous challenges. One major challenge is to unify
decentrality with traditional self-adaptive implementation framework during
design and implementation activity. One is to guarantee the required global
goals and performance of decentralized self-adaptive systems operating in
highly dynamic and uncertain environments. Another challenge is to predict the
influence of system's internal change on its self-adaptability to the
environment. To solve these problems, we combine the mechanisms of separation
of concerns with modeling method using timed automata to allow the system to be
analyzed and verified. Timed computation tree logic is used to specify system
goals and stochastic simulations in dynamic environment are experimented to
verify decentralized self-adaptive system's adaptation properties. In this
paper, we extracted a motivation example from practical applications in UAV
emergency mission scenarios. The whole approach is evaluated and illustrated
with this motivation example and the statistical results can be used as
reference for arrangement planning of UAVs in cyber physical spaces.

 <dc:description>  Mobile applications (a.k.a., apps), which facilitate a large variety of tasks
on mobile devices, have become indispensable in our everyday lives.
Accomplishing a task may require the user to navigate among various apps.
Unlike Web pages that are inherently interconnected through hyperlinks, mobile
apps are usually isolated building blocks, and the lack of direct links between
apps has largely compromised the efficiency of task completion. In this paper,
we present the first in-depth empirical study of inter-app navigation behaviors
of smartphone users based on a comprehensive dataset collected through a
sizable user study over three months. We propose a model to distinguish
informational pages and transitional pages, based on which a large number of
inter-app navigation are identified. We reveal that developing 'tunnels'
between of isolated apps has a huge potential to reduce the cost of navigation.
Our analysis provides various practical implications on how to improve
app-navigation experiences from both the operating system's perspective and the
developer's perspective.

 <dc:description>  Skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted a lot of research
attention during the past few years. Recent works attempted to utilize
recurrent neural networks to model the temporal dependencies between the 3D
positional configurations of human body joints for better analysis of human
activities in the skeletal data. The proposed work extends this idea to spatial
domain as well as temporal domain to better analyze the hidden sources of
action-related information within the human skeleton sequences in both of these
domains simultaneously. Based on the pictorial structure of Kinect's skeletal
data, an effective tree-structure based traversal framework is also proposed.
In order to deal with the noise in the skeletal data, a new gating mechanism
within LSTM module is introduced, with which the network can learn the
reliability of the sequential data and accordingly adjust the effect of the
input data on the updating procedure of the long-term context representation
stored in the unit's memory cell. Moreover, we introduce a novel multi-modal
feature fusion strategy within the LSTM unit in this paper. The comprehensive
experimental results on seven challenging benchmark datasets for human action
recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

 <dc:title>Wideband DOA Estimation through Projection Matrix Interpolation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Selva, J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a method to reduce the complexity of the deterministic
maximum likelihood (DML) estimator in the wideband direction-of-arrival (WDOA)
problem, which is based on interpolating the array projection matrix in the
temporal frequency variable. It is shown that an accurate interpolator like
Chebyshev's is able to produce DML cost functions comprising just a few
narrowband-like summands. Actually, the number of such summands is far smaller
(roughly by factor ten in the numerical examples) than the corresponding number
in the ML cost function that is derived by dividing the spectrum into separate
bins. The paper also presents two spin-offs of the interpolation method. The
first is a fast procedure to compute one-dimensional search estimators like
Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), that exploits the close relation
between Chebyshev interpolation and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). And
the second is a detection-estimation procedure for the DML estimator. The
methods in the paper are assessed in several numerical examples.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of communication over compound quantum channel in the
presence of entanglement. Classically such channels are modeled as a collection
of conditional probability distributions wherein neither the sender nor the
receiver is aware of the channel being used for transmission, except for the
fact that it belongs to this collection. We provide achievability and converse
bounds for this problem in the one shot quantum setting in terms of quantum
hypothesis testing divergence. We also consider the case of informed sender,
showing a one shot achievability result that converges appropriately in the
asymptotic i.i.d. setting. Our achievability proof is similar in spirit to its
classical counterpart. To arrive at our result, we use the technique of
position based decoding along with a new approach for constructing a union of
two projectors, which can be of independent interest.

over dynamically built spanning trees rooted at the message's source. For a

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we revisit the idea of putting interfaces to sleep during
'packet overhearing' (i.e., when there are ongoing transmissions addressed to
other stations) from a practical standpoint. To this aim, we perform a robust
experimental characterisation of the timing and consumption behaviour of a
commercial 802.11 card. We design $\mu$Nap, a local standard-compliant
energy-saving mechanism that leverages micro-sleep opportunities inherent to
the CSMA operation of 802.11 WLANs. This mechanism is backwards compatible and
incrementally deployable, and takes into account the timing limitations of
existing hardware, as well as practical CSMA-related issues (e.g., capture
effect). According to the performance assessment carried out through
trace-based simulation, the use of our scheme would result in a 57% reduction
in the time spent in overhearing, thus leading to an energy saving of 15.8% of
the activity time.

 <dc:title>A simple method for shifting local dq impedance models to a global

 <dc:description>  Impedance-based stability analysis in the dq-domain is a widely applied
method for power electronic dominated systems. An inconvenient property with
this method is that impedance models are normally referred to their own local
reference frame, and need to be recalculated when referring to a global
reference frame in a given network. This letter presents a simple method for
translating impedance sub-models within a complex network, from their own
reference frames to any given point in the network. What distinguishes this
method is that by using a simple rotational matrix, it only needs impedance
models in their own local reference frames, to be translated to a global
reference in the network. By way of this method, standard circuit analysis
rules for series and parallel connection are applicable, as proven in the
letter. The method is defined and validated for impedances in the dq and
modified sequence domains, and it is shown that the dependency on reference
frame is marginal in the latter. An additional finding from the application of
this method is that components or subsystems with a certain symmetry property
called Mirror Frequency Decoupling are invariant to the choice of reference
frame.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We compare pushdown automata (PDAs for short) against other representations.
First, we show that there is a family of PDAs over a unary alphabet with $n$
states and $p \geq 2n + 4$ stack symbols that accepts one single long word for
which every equivalent context-free grammar needs $\Omega(n^2(p-2n-4))$
variables. This family shows that the classical algorithm for converting a PDA
to an equivalent context-free grammar is optimal even when the alphabet is
unary. Moreover, we observe that language equivalence and Parikh equivalence,
which ignores the ordering between symbols, coincide for this family. We
conclude that, when assuming this weaker equivalence, the conversion algorithm
is also optimal. Second, Parikh's theorem motivates the comparison of PDAs
against finite state automata. In particular, the same family of unary PDAs
gives a lower bound on the number of states of every Parikh-equivalent finite
state automaton. Finally, we look into the case of unary deterministic PDAs. We
show a new construction converting a unary deterministic PDA into an equivalent
context-free grammar that achieves best known bounds.

 <dc:description>  Nested weighted automata (NWA) present a robust and convenient
automata-theoretic formalism for quantitative specifications. Previous works
have considered NWA that processed input words only in the forward direction.
It is natural to allow the automata to process input words backwards as well,
for example, to measure the maximal or average time between a response and the
preceding request. We therefore introduce and study bidirectional NWA that can
process input words in both directions. First, we show that bidirectional NWA
can express interesting quantitative properties that are not expressible by
forward-only NWA. Second, for the fundamental decision problems of emptiness
and universality, we establish decidability and complexity results for the new
framework which match the best-known results for the special case of
forward-only NWA. Thus, for NWA, the increased expressiveness of
bidirectionality is achieved at no additional computational complexity. This is
in stark contrast to the unweighted case, where bidirectional finite automata
are no more expressive but exponentially more succinct than their forward-only
counterparts.

of using temporal landmarks to handle the state trajectory constraints of
PDDL3.0. We analyze the formalism of TempLM, a temporal planner particularly

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the modern theory of the Bayesian brain from
cognitive neurosciences in the light of recommender systems and expose
potentials for our community. In particular, we elaborate on noisy user
feedback and the thus resulting multicomponent user models, which have indeed a
biological origin. In real user experiments we observe the impact of both
factors directly in a repeated rating task along with recommendation. As a
consequence, this contribution supports the plausibility of contemporary
theories of mind in the context of recommender systems and can be understood as
a solicitation to integrate ideas of cognitive neurosciences into our systems
in order to further improve the prediction of human behaviour.

 <dc:description>  Multi-label learning deals with training instances associated with multiple
labels. Many common multi-label algorithms are to treat each label in a crisp
manner, being either relevant or irrelevant to an instance, and such label can
be called logical label. In contrast, we assume that there is a vector of
numerical label behind each multi-label instance, and the numerical label can
be treated as the indicator to judge whether the corresponding label is
relevant or irrelevant to the instance. The approach we are proposing
transforms multilabel problem into regression problem about numerical labels
which can reflect the hidden label importance. In order to explore the
numerical label, one way is to extend the label space to a Euclidean space by
mining the hidden label importance from the training instances. Such process of
transforming logical labels into numerical labels is called Label Enhancement.
Besides, we give three assumptions for numerical label of multi-label instance
in this paper. Based on this, we propose an effective multi-label learning
framework called MLL-LE, i.e., Multi-Label Learning with Label Enhancement,
which incorporates the regression loss and the three assumptions into a unified
framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MLL-LE
framework.

 <dc:description>  Aptamers are single stranded DNA, RNA or peptide sequences having the ability
to bind a variety of specific targets (proteins, molecules as well as ions).
Therefore, aptamer production and selection for therapeutic and diagnostic
applications is very challenging. Usually they are in vitro generated, but,
recently, computational approaches have been developed for the in silico
selection, with a higher affinity for the specific target. Anyway, the
mechanism of aptamer-ligand formation is not completely clear, and not obvious
to predict. This paper aims to develop a computational model able to describe
aptamer-ligand affinity performance by using the topological structure of the
corresponding graphs, assessed by means of numerical tools such as the
conventional degree distribution, but also the rank-degree distribution
(hierarchy) and the node assortativity. Calculations are applied to the
thrombin binding aptamer (TBA), and the TBA-thrombin complex, produced in the
presence of Na+ or K+. The topological analysis reveals different affinity
performances between the macromolecules in the presence of the two cations, as
expected by previous investigations in literature. These results nominate the
graph topological analysis as a novel theoretical tool for testing affinity.
Otherwise, starting from the graphs, an electrical network can be obtained by
using the specific electrical properties of amino acids and nucleobases.
Therefore, a further analysis concerns with the electrical response, which
reveals that the resistance sensitively depends on the presence of sodium or
potassium thus posing resistance as a crucial physical parameter for testing
affinity.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a technique for symmetry reduction that adaptively
assigns a prefix of variables in a system of constraints so that the generated
prefix-assignments are pairwise nonisomorphic under the action of the symmetry
group of the system. The technique is based on McKay's canonical extension
framework [J. Algorithms 26 (1998), no. 2, 306-324]. Among key features of the
technique are (i) adaptability - the prefix sequence can be user-prescribed and
truncated for compatibility with the group of symmetries; (ii)
parallelisability - prefix-assignments can be processed in parallel
independently of each other; (iii) versatility - the method is applicable
whenever the group of symmetries can be concisely represented as the
automorphism group of a vertex-colored graph; and (iv) implementability - the
method can be implemented relying on a canonical labeling map for
vertex-colored graphs as the only nontrivial subroutine. To demonstrate the
tentative practical applicability of our technique we have prepared a
preliminary implementation and report on a limited set of experiments that
demonstrate ability to reduce symmetry on hard instances.

 <dc:title>The Boolean Solution Problem from the Perspective of Predicate Logic -
  Extended Version</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wernhard, Christoph</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Finding solution values for unknowns in Boolean equations was a principal
reasoning mode in the Algebra of Logic of the 19th century. Schr\&quot;oder
investigated it as &quot;Aufl\&quot;osungsproblem&quot; (&quot;solution problem&quot;). It is closely
related to the modern notion of Boolean unification. Today it is commonly
presented in an algebraic setting, but seems potentially useful also in
knowledge representation based on predicate logic. We show that it can be
modeled on the basis of first-order logic extended by second-order
quantification. A wealth of classical results transfers, foundations for
algorithms unfold, and connections with second-order quantifier elimination and
Craig interpolation show up. Although for first-order inputs the set of
solutions is recursively enumerable, the development of constructive methods
remains a challenge. We identify some cases that allow constructions, most of
them based on Craig interpolation, and show a method to take vocabulary
restrictions on solution components into account.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of learning when obtaining the training labels is
costly, which is usually tackled in the literature using active-learning
techniques. These approaches provide strategies to choose the examples to label
before or during training. These strategies are usually based on heuristics or
even theoretical measures, but are not learned as they are directly used during
training. We design a model which aims at \textit{learning active-learning
strategies} using a meta-learning setting. More specifically, we consider a
pool-based setting, where the system observes all the examples of the dataset
of a problem and has to choose the subset of examples to label in a single
shot. Experiments show encouraging results.

 <dc:description>  We present a method to jointly refine the geometry and semantic segmentation
of 3D surface meshes. Our method alternates between updating the shape and the
semantic labels. In the geometry refinement step, the mesh is deformed with
variational energy minimization, such that it simultaneously maximizes
photo-consistency and the compatibility of the semantic segmentations across a
set of calibrated images. Label-specific shape priors account for interactions
between the geometry and the semantic labels in 3D. In the semantic
segmentation step, the labels on the mesh are updated with MRF inference, such
that they are compatible with the semantic segmentations in the input images.
Also, this step includes prior assumptions about the surface shape of different
semantic classes. The priors induce a tight coupling, where semantic
information influences the shape update and vice versa. Specifically, we
introduce priors that favor (i) adaptive smoothing, depending on the class
label; (ii) straightness of class boundaries; and (iii) semantic labels that
are consistent with the surface orientation. The novel mesh-based
reconstruction is evaluated in a series of experiments with real and synthetic
data. We compare both to state-of-the-art, voxel-based semantic 3D
reconstruction, and to purely geometric mesh refinement, and demonstrate that
the proposed scheme yields improved 3D geometry as well as an improved semantic
segmentation.

 <dc:description>  Rate adaptation and transmission power control in 802.11 WLANs have received
a lot of attention from the research community, with most of the proposals
aiming at maximising throughput based on network conditions. Considering energy
consumption, an implicit assumption is that optimality in throughput implies
optimality in energy efficiency, but this assumption has been recently put into
question. In this paper, we address via analysis, simulation and
experimentation the relation between throughput performance and energy
efficiency in multi-rate 802.11 scenarios. We demonstrate the trade-off between
these performance figures, confirming that they may not be simultaneously
optimised, and analyse their sensitivity towards the energy consumption
parameters of the device. We analyse this trade-off in existing rate adaptation
with transmission power control algorithms, and discuss how to design novel
schemes taking energy consumption into account.

 <dc:title>Beyond Moore-Penrose Part I: Generalized Inverses that Minimize Matrix
  Norms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dokmani&#x107;, Ivan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Gribonval, R&#xe9;mi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This is the first paper of a two-long series in which we study linear
generalized inverses that minimize matrix norms. Such generalized inverses are
famously represented by the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse (MPP) which happens to
minimize the Frobenius norm. Freeing up the degrees of freedom associated with
Frobenius optimality enables us to promote other interesting properties. In
this Part I, we look at the basic properties of norm-minimizing generalized
inverses, especially in terms of uniqueness and relation to the MPP. We first
show that the MPP minimizes many norms beyond those unitarily invariant, thus
further bolstering its role as a robust choice in many situations. We then
concentrate on some norms which are generally not minimized by the MPP, but
whose minimization is relevant for linear inverse problems and sparse
representations. In particular, we look at mixed norms and the induced $\ell^p
\rightarrow \ell^q$ norms. An interesting representative is the sparse
pseudoinverse which we study in much more detail in Part II. Next, we shift
attention from norms to matrices with interesting behaviors. We exhibit a class
whose generalized inverse is always the MPP-even for norms that normally result
in different inverses-and a class for which many generalized inverses coincide,
but not with the MPP. Finally, we discuss efficient computation of
norm-minimizing generalized inverses.

 <dc:description>  Robots are expected to operate autonomously in dynamic environments.
Understanding the underlying dynamic characteristics of objects is a key
enabler for achieving this goal. In this paper, we propose a method for
pointwise semantic classification of 3D LiDAR data into three classes:
non-movable, movable and dynamic. We concentrate on understanding these
specific semantics because they characterize important information required for
an autonomous system. Non-movable points in the scene belong to unchanging
segments of the environment, whereas the remaining classes corresponds to the
changing parts of the scene. The difference between the movable and dynamic
class is their motion state. The dynamic points can be perceived as moving,
whereas movable objects can move, but are perceived as static. To learn the
distinction between movable and non-movable points in the environment, we
introduce an approach based on deep neural network and for detecting the
dynamic points, we estimate pointwise motion. We propose a Bayes filter
framework for combining the learned semantic cues with the motion cues to infer
the required semantic classification. In extensive experiments, we compare our
approach with other methods on a standard benchmark dataset and report
competitive results in comparison to the existing state-of-the-art.
Furthermore, we show an improvement in the classification of points by
combining the semantic cues retrieved from the neural network with the motion
cues.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel massively parallel algorithm for
accelerating the decision tree building procedure on GPUs (Graphics Processing
Units), which is a crucial step in Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) and
random forests training. Previous GPU based tree building algorithms are based
on parallel multi-scan or radix sort to find the exact tree split, and thus
suffer from scalability and performance issues. We show that using a histogram
based algorithm to approximately find the best split is more efficient and
scalable on GPU. By identifying the difference between classical GPU-based
image histogram construction and the feature histogram construction in decision
tree training, we develop a fast feature histogram building kernel on GPU with
carefully designed computational and memory access sequence to reduce atomic
update conflict and maximize GPU utilization. Our algorithm can be used as a
drop-in replacement for histogram construction in popular tree boosting systems
to improve their scalability. As an example, to train GBDT on epsilon dataset,
our method using a main-stream GPU is 7-8 times faster than histogram based
algorithm on CPU in LightGBM and 25 times faster than the exact-split finding
algorithm in XGBoost on a dual-socket 28-core Xeon server, while achieving
similar prediction accuracy.

 <dc:title>Ordered and Delayed Adversaries and How to Work against Them on a Shared

 <dc:description>  An execution of a distributed algorithm is a game between the algorithm and
an adversary causing distractions to the computation. In this work we define a
class of ordered adversaries causing distractions according to some partial
order fixed by the adversary before the execution, and study how they affect
performance of algorithms. We focus on Do-All problem of performing t tasks on
a shared channel consisting of p crash-prone stations. The channel restricts
communication: no message is delivered to the alive stations if more than one
station transmits at the same time. The performance measure for Do-All problem
is work: the total number of available processor steps during the whole
execution. We address the question of how the ordered adversaries controlling
crashes of stations influence work performance of Do-All algorithms. The first
presented algorithm solves Do-All with work O(t+p\sqrt{t}\log p) against the
Linearly-Ordered adversary, restricted by some pre-defined linear order of
crashing stations. Another algorithm runs against the Weakly-Adaptive
adversary, restricted by some pre-defined set of f crash-prone stations (it can
be seen as restricted by the order being an anti-chain of crashing stations).
The work done by this algorithm is O(t+p\sqrt{t}+p\min{p/(p-f),t}\log p). Both
results are close to the corresponding lower bounds from [CKL]. We generalize
this result to the class of adversaries restricted by partial order of maximum
anti-chain of size k and complementary lower bound. We also consider a class of
delayed adaptive adversaries, who could see random choices with some delay. We
give an algorithm that runs against the 1-RD adversary (seeing random choices
of stations with one round delay), achieving close to optimal
O(t+p\sqrt{t}\log^2 p) work complexity. This shows that restricting adversary
by even 1 round delay results in (almost) optimal work on a shared channel.

 <dc:description>  In the game of Cops and Robbers, a team of cops attempts to capture a robber
on a graph $G$. All players occupy vertices of $G$. The game operates in
rounds; in each round the cops move to neighboring vertices, after which the
robber does the same. The minimum number of cops needed to guarantee capture of
a robber on $G$ is the cop number of $G$, denoted $c(G)$, and the minimum
number of rounds needed for them to do so is the capture time. It has long been
known that the capture time of an $n$-vertex graph with cop number $k$ is
$O(n^{k+1})$. More recently, Bonato, Golovach, Hahn, and Kratochv\'{i}l (2009)
and Gaven\v{c}iak (2010) showed that for $k = 1$, this upper bound is not
asymptotically tight: for graphs with cop number 1, the cop can always win
within $n-4$ rounds. In this paper, we show that the upper bound is tight when
$k \ge 2$: for fixed $k \ge 2$, we construct arbitrarily large graphs $G$
having capture time at least $\left (\frac{\vert V(G) \vert}{40k^4}\right
)^{k+1}$.
  In the process of proving our main result, we establish results that may be
of independent interest. In particular, we show that the problem of deciding
whether $k$ cops can capture a robber on a directed graph is polynomial-time
equivalent to deciding whether $k$ cops can capture a robber on an undirected
graph. As a corollary of this fact, we obtain a relatively short proof of a
major conjecture of Goldstein and Reingold (1995), which was recently proved
through other means (Kinnersley, 2015).

 <dc:description>  The standard operational semantics of the sequential composition operator
gives rise to unbounded branching and forgetfulness when transparent process
expressions are put in sequence. Due to transparency, the correspondence
between context-free and pushdown processes fails modulo bisimilarity, and it
is not clear how to specify an always terminating half counter. We propose a
revised operational semantics for the sequential composition operator in the
context of intermediate termination. With the revised operational semantics, we
eliminate transparency. As a consequence, we establish a correspondence between
context-free processes and pushdown processes. Moreover, we prove the reactive
Turing powerfulness of TCP with iteration and nesting with the revised
operational semantics for sequential composition.

 <dc:title>Counting Restricted Homomorphisms via M\&quot;obius Inversion over Matroid
  Lattices</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Roth, Marc</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a framework for the complexity classification of parameterized
counting problems that can be formulated as the summation over the numbers of
homomorphisms from small pattern graphs H_1,...,H_l to a big host graph G with
the restriction that the coefficients correspond to evaluations of the M\&quot;obius
function over the lattice of a graphic matroid. This generalizes the idea of
Curticapean, Dell and Marx [STOC 17] who used a result of Lov\'asz stating that
the number of subgraph embeddings from a graph H to a graph G can be expressed
as such a sum over the lattice of partitions of H. In the first step we
introduce what we call graphically restricted homomorphisms that, inter alia,
generalize subgraph embeddings as well as locally injective homomorphisms. We
provide a complete parameterized complexity dichotomy for counting such
homomorphisms, that is, we identify classes of patterns for which the problem
is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), including an algorithm, and prove that all
other pattern classes lead to #W[1]-hard problems. The main ingredients of the
proof are the complexity classification of linear combinations of homomorphisms
due to Curticapean, Dell and Marx [STOC 17] as well as a corollary of Rota's
NBC Theorem which states that the sign of the M\&quot;obius function over a
geometric lattice only depends on the rank of its arguments. We use the general
theorem to classify the complexity of counting locally injective homomorphisms
as well as homomorphisms that are injective in the r-neighborhood for constant
r. Furthermore, we show that the former has &quot;real&quot; FPT cases by considering the
subgraph counting problem restricted to trees on both sides. Finally we show
that the dichotomy for counting graphically restricted homomorphisms readily
extends to so-called linear combinations.

 <dc:description>  Today, massive amounts of streaming data from smart devices need to be
analyzed automatically to realize the Internet of Things. The Complex Event
Processing (CEP) paradigm promises low-latency pattern detection on event
streams. However, CEP systems need to be extended with Machine Learning (ML)
capabilities such as online training and inference in order to be able to
detect fuzzy patterns (e.g., outliers) and to improve pattern recognition
accuracy during runtime using incremental model training. In this paper, we
propose a distributed CEP system denoted as StreamLearner for ML-enabled
complex event detection. The proposed programming model and data-parallel
system architecture enable a wide range of real-world applications and allow
for dynamically scaling up and out system resources for low-latency,
high-throughput event processing. We show that the DEBS Grand Challenge 2017
case study (i.e., anomaly detection in smart factories) integrates seamlessly
into the StreamLearner API. Our experiments verify scalability and high event
throughput of StreamLearner.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new selection rule for the coordinate selection in coordinate
descent methods for huge-scale optimization. The efficiency of this novel
scheme is provably better than the efficiency of uniformly random selection,
and can reach the efficiency of steepest coordinate descent (SCD), enabling an
acceleration of a factor of up to $n$, the number of coordinates. In many
practical applications, our scheme can be implemented at no extra cost and
computational efficiency very close to the faster uniform selection. Numerical
experiments with Lasso and Ridge regression show promising improvements, in
line with our theoretical guarantees.

 <dc:description>  We introduce and study cellular automata whose cell spaces are
left-homogeneous spaces. Examples of left-homogeneous spaces are spheres,
Euclidean spaces, as well as hyperbolic spaces acted on by isometries; uniform
tilings acted on by symmetries; vertex-transitive graphs, in particular, Cayley
graphs, acted on by automorphisms; groups acting on themselves by
multiplication; and integer lattices acted on by translations. For such
automata and spaces, we prove, in particular, generalisations of topological
and uniform variants of the Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon theorem, of the
Tarski-F{\o}lner theorem, and of the Garden-of-Eden theorem on the full shift
and certain subshifts. Moreover, we introduce signal machines that can handle
accumulations of events and using such machines we present a time-optimal
quasi-solution of the firing mob synchronisation problem on finite and
connected graphs.

 <dc:title>Bounds on the Satisfiability Threshold for Power Law Distributed Random

 <dc:description>  Propositional satisfiability (SAT) is one of the most fundamental problems in
computer science. The worst-case hardness of SAT lies at the core of
computational complexity theory. The average-case analysis of SAT has triggered
the development of sophisticated rigorous and non-rigorous techniques for
analyzing random structures.
  Despite a long line of research and substantial progress, nearly all
theoretical work on random SAT assumes a uniform distribution on the variables.
In contrast, real-world instances often exhibit large fluctuations in variable
occurrence. This can be modeled by a scale-free distribution of the variables,
which results in distributions closer to industrial SAT instances.
  We study random k-SAT on n variables, $m=\Theta(n)$ clauses, and a power law
distribution on the variable occurrences with exponent $\beta$. We observe a
satisfiability threshold at $\beta=(2k-1)/(k-1)$. This threshold is tight in
the sense that instances with $\beta\le(2k-1)/(k-1)-\varepsilon$ for any
constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$ are unsatisfiable with high probability (w.h.p.). For
$\beta\geq(2k-1)/(k-1)+\varepsilon$, the picture is reminiscent of the uniform
case: instances are satisfiable w.h.p. for sufficiently small constant
clause-variable ratios $m/n$; they are unsatisfiable above a ratio $m/n$ that
depends on $\beta$.

 <dc:description>  Colombia has a privileged geographical location which makes it a cornerstone
and equidistant point to all regional markets. The country has a great
ecological diversity and it is one of the largest suppliers of flowers for US.
Colombian flower companies have made innovations in the marketing process,
using methods to reach all conditions for final consumers. This article
develops a monitoring system for floriculture industries. The system was
implemented in a robotic platform. This device has the ability to be programmed
in different programming languages. The robot takes the necessary environment
information from its camera. The algorithm of the monitoring system was
developed with the image processing toolbox on Matlab. The implemented
algorithm acquires images through its camera, it performs a preprocessing of
the image, noise filter, enhancing of the color and adjusting the dimension in
order to increase processing speed. Then, the image is segmented by color and
with the binarized version of the image using morphological operations (erosion
and dilation), extract relevant features such as centroid, perimeter and area.
The data obtained from the image processing helps the robot with the automatic
identification of objectives, orientation and move towards them. Also, the
results generate a diagnostic quality of each object scanned.

 <dc:description>  The task of learning to pick a single preferred example out a finite set of
examples, an &quot;optimal choice problem&quot;, is a supervised machine learning problem
with complex, structured input. Problems of optimal choice emerge often in
various practical applications. We formalize the problem, show that it does not
satisfy the assumptions of statistical learning theory, yet it can be solved
efficiently in some cases. We propose two approaches to solve the problem. Both
of them reach good solutions on real life data from a signal processing
application.

 <dc:description>  Awareness of the road scene is an essential component for both autonomous
vehicles and Advances Driver Assistance Systems and is gaining importance both
for the academia and car companies. This paper presents a way to learn a
semantic-aware transformation which maps detections from a dashboard camera
view onto a broader bird's eye occupancy map of the scene. To this end, a huge
synthetic dataset featuring 1M couples of frames, taken from both car dashboard
and bird's eye view, has been collected and automatically annotated. A
deep-network is then trained to warp detections from the first to the second
view. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model against several baselines
and observe that is able to generalize on real-world data despite having been
trained solely on synthetic ones.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we characterize the set of polynomials $f\in\mathbb F_q[X]$
satisfying the following property: there exists a positive integer $d$ such
that for any positive integer $\ell$ less or equal than the degree of $f$,
there exists $t_0$ in $\mathbb F_{q^d}$ such that the polynomial $f-t_0$ has an
irreducible factor of degree $\ell$ over $\mathbb F_{q^d}[X]$. This result is
then used to progress in the last step which is needed to remove the heuristic
from one of the quasi-polynomial time algorithms for discrete logarithm
problems (DLP) in small characteristic. Our characterization allows a
construction of polynomials satisfying the wanted property.

 <dc:description>  Modern industrial automatic machines and robotic cells are equipped with
highly complex human-machine interfaces (HMIs) that often prevent human
operators from an effective use of the automatic systems. In particular, this
applies to vulnerable users, such as those with low experience or education
level, the elderly and the disabled. To tackle this issue, it becomes necessary
to design user-oriented HMIs, which adapt to the capabilities and skills of
users, thus compensating their limitations and taking full advantage of their
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a methodological approach to the design of
complex adaptive human-machine systems that might be inclusive of all users, in
particular the vulnerable ones. The proposed approach takes into account both
the technical requirements and the requirements for ethical, legal and social
implications (ELSI) for the design of automatic systems. The technical
requirements derive from a thorough analysis of three use cases taken from the
European project INCLUSIVE. To achieve the ELSI requirements, the MEESTAR
approach is combined with the specific legal issues for occupational systems
and requirements of the target users.

 <dc:description>  Modern manufacturing systems typically require high degrees of flexibility,
in terms of ability to customize the production lines to the constantly
changing market requests. For this purpose, manufacturing systems are required
to be able to cope with changes in the types of products, and in the size of
the production batches. As a consequence, the human-machine interfaces (HMIs)
are typically very complex, and include a wide range of possible operational
modes and commands. This generally implies an unsustainable cognitive workload
for the human operators, in addition to a non-negligible training effort. To
overcome this issue, in this paper we present a methodology for the design of
adaptive human-centred HMIs for industrial machines and robots. The proposed
approach relies on three pillars: measurement of user's capabilities,
adaptation of the information presented in the HMI, and training of the user.
The results expected from the application of the proposed methodology are
investigated in terms of increased customization and productivity of
manufacturing processes, and wider acceptance of automation technologies. The
proposed approach has been devised in the framework of the European project
INCLUSIVE.

 <dc:title>Distributed compression through the lens of algorithmic information
  theory: a primer</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zimand, Marius</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Distributed compression is the task of compressing correlated data by several
parties, each one possessing one piece of data and acting separately. The
classical Slepian-Wolf theorem (D. Slepian, J. K. Wolf, IEEE Transactions on
Inf. Theory, 1973) shows that if data is generated by independent draws from a
joint distribution, that is by a memoryless stochastic process, then
distributed compression can achieve the same compression rates as centralized
compression when the parties act together. Recently, the author (M. Zimand,
STOC 2017) has obtained an analogue version of the Slepian-Wolf theorem in the
framework of Algorithmic Information Theory (also known as Kolmogorov
complexity). The advantage over the classical theorem, is that the AIT version
works for individual strings, without any assumption regarding the generative
process. The only requirement is that the parties know the complexity profile
of the input strings, which is a simple quantitative measure of the data
correlation. The goal of this paper is to present in an accessible form that
omits some technical details the main ideas from the reference (M. Zimand, STOC
2017).

 <dc:description>  Quantum annealers aim at solving non-convex optimization problems by
exploiting cooperative tunneling effects to escape local minima. The underlying
idea consists in designing a classical energy function whose ground states are
the sought optimal solutions of the original optimization problem and add a
controllable quantum transverse field to generate tunneling processes. A key
challenge is to identify classes of non-convex optimization problems for which
quantum annealing remains efficient while thermal annealing fails. We show that
this happens for a wide class of problems which are central to machine
learning. Their energy landscapes is dominated by local minima that cause
exponential slow down of classical thermal annealers while simulated quantum
annealing converges efficiently to rare dense regions of optimal solutions.

 <dc:description>  We develop a method for generating pseudorandom binary sequences using the
Bernoulli map on cubic algebraic integers. The distinguishing characteristic of
our generator is that it generates chaotic true orbits of the Bernoulli map by
exact computation. In particular, we clarify a way to properly prepare a set of
initial points (i.e., seeds), which is needed when generating multiple
pseudorandom sequences. With this seed selection method, we can distribute the
initial points almost uniformly in the unit interval and can also guarantee
that the orbits starting from them do not merge. We also report results of a
large variety of tests indicating that the generated pseudorandom sequences
have good statistical properties as well as an advantage over what is probably
the most popular generator, the Mersenne Twister MT19937.

 <dc:description>  Image captioning has been recently gaining a lot of attention thanks to the
impressive achievements shown by deep captioning architectures, which combine
Convolutional Neural Networks to extract image representations, and Recurrent
Neural Networks to generate the corresponding captions. At the same time, a
significant research effort has been dedicated to the development of saliency
prediction models, which can predict human eye fixations. Even though saliency
information could be useful to condition an image captioning architecture, by
providing an indication of what is salient and what is not, research is still
struggling to incorporate these two techniques. In this work, we propose an
image captioning approach in which a generative recurrent neural network can
focus on different parts of the input image during the generation of the
caption, by exploiting the conditioning given by a saliency prediction model on
which parts of the image are salient and which are contextual. We show, through
extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on large scale datasets,
that our model achieves superior performances with respect to captioning
baselines with and without saliency, and to different state of the art
approaches combining saliency and captioning.

 <dc:description>  Generative encoder-decoder models offer great promise in developing
domain-general dialog systems. However, they have mainly been applied to
open-domain conversations. This paper presents a practical and novel framework
for building task-oriented dialog systems based on encoder-decoder models. This
framework enables encoder-decoder models to accomplish slot-value independent
decision-making and interact with external databases. Moreover, this paper
shows the flexibility of the proposed method by interleaving chatting
capability with a slot-filling system for better out-of-domain recovery. The
models were trained on both real-user data from a bus information system and
human-human chat data. Results show that the proposed framework achieves good
performance in both offline evaluation metrics and in task success rate with
human users.

 <dc:description>  This paper analyzes the structure of mixed-strategy equilibria for Colonel
Blotto games, where the outcome on each battlefield is a polynomial function of
the difference between the two players' allocations. This paper severely
reduces the set of strategies that needs to be searched to find a Nash
equilibrium. It finds that there exists a Nash equilibrium where both players'
mixed strategies are discrete distributions, and it places an upper bound on
the number of points in the supports of these discrete distributions.

 <dc:title>Translations: generalizing relative expressiveness between logics</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  There is a strong demand for precise means for the comparison of logics in
terms of expressiveness both from theoretical and from application areas. The
aim of this paper is to propose a sufficiently general and reasonable formal
criterion for expressiveness, so as to apply not only to model-theoretic
logics, but also to Tarskian and proof-theoretic logics. For model-theoretic
logics there is a standard framework of relative expressiveness, based on the
capacity of characterizing structures, and a straightforward formal criterion
issuing from it. The problem is that it only allows the comparison of those
logics defined within the same class of models. The urge for a broader
framework of expressiveness is not new. Nevertheless, the enterprise is complex
and a reasonable model-theoretic formal criterion is still wanting. Recently
there appeared two criteria in this wider framework, one from Garc\'ia-Matos &amp;
V\&quot;a\&quot;an\&quot;anen and other from L. Kuijer. We argue that they are not adequate.
Their limitations are analyzed and we propose to move to an even broader
framework lacking model-theoretic notions, which we call &quot;translational
expressiveness&quot;. There is already a criterion in this later framework by
Mossakowski et al., however it turned out to be too lax. We propose some
adequacy criteria for expressiveness and a formal criterion of translational
expressiveness complying with them is given.

 <dc:description>  Data association problems are an important component of many computer vision
applications, with multi-object tracking being one of the most prominent
examples. A typical approach to data association involves finding a graph
matching or network flow that minimizes a sum of pairwise association costs,
which are often either hand-crafted or learned as linear functions of fixed
features. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn features
for network-flow-based data association via backpropagation, by expressing the
optimum of a smoothed network flow problem as a differentiable function of the
pairwise association costs. We apply this approach to multi-object tracking
with a network flow formulation. Our experiments demonstrate that we are able
to successfully learn all cost functions for the association problem in an
end-to-end fashion, which outperform hand-crafted costs in all settings. The
integration and combination of various sources of inputs becomes easy and the
cost functions can be learned entirely from data, alleviating tedious
hand-designing of costs.

 <dc:title>Queueing in the Mist: Buffering and Scheduling with Limited Knowledge</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Scheduling and managing queues with bounded buffers are among the most
fundamental problems in computer networking. Traditionally, it is often assumed
that all the proper- ties of each packet are known immediately upon arrival.
However, as traffic becomes increasingly heterogeneous and complex, such
assumptions are in many cases invalid. In particular, in various scenarios
information about packet characteristics becomes avail- able only after the
packet has undergone some initial processing. In this work, we study the
problem of managing queues with limited knowledge. We start by showing lower
bounds on the competitive ratio of any algorithm in such settings. Next, we use
the insight obtained from these bounds to identify several algorithmic concepts
appropriate for the problem, and use these guidelines to design a concrete
algorithmic framework. We analyze the performance of our proposed algorithm,
and further show how it can be implemented in various settings, which differ by
the type and nature of the unknown information. We further validate our results
and algorithmic approach by a simulation study that provides further insights
as to our algorithmic design principles in face of limited knowledge.

 <dc:description>  This letter considers two groups of source nodes. Each group transmits
packets to its own designated destination node over single-hop links and via a
cluster of relay nodes shared by both groups. In an effort to boost reliability
without sacrificing throughput, a scheme is proposed, whereby packets at the
relay nodes are combined using two methods; packets delivered by different
groups are mixed using non-orthogonal multiple access principles, while packets
originating from the same group are mixed using random linear network coding.
An analytical framework that characterizes the performance of the proposed
scheme is developed, compared to simulation results and benchmarked against a
counterpart scheme that is based on orthogonal multiple access.

 <dc:description>  Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) entails clinical evaluation of
multiple cognition metrics and biomarkers. Metrics such as the Alzheimer's
Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive test (ADAS-cog) comprise multiple
subscores that quantify different aspects of a patient's cognitive state such
as learning, memory, and language production/comprehension. Although
computer-aided diagnostic techniques for classification of a patient's current
disease state exist, they provide little insight into the relationship between
changes in brain structure and different aspects of a patient's cognitive state
that occur over time in AD. We have developed a Convolutional Neural Network
architecture that can concurrently predict the trajectories of the 13 subscores
comprised by a subject's ADAS-cog examination results from a current minimally
preprocessed structural MRI scan up to 36 months from image acquisition time
without resorting to manual feature extraction. Mean performance metrics are
within range of those of existing techniques that require manual feature
selection and are limited to predicting aggregate scores.

 <dc:description>  Current grammar-based NeuroEvolution approaches have several shortcomings. On
the one hand, they do not allow the generation of Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs composed of more than one hidden-layer. On the other, there is no way to
evolve networks with more than one output neuron. To properly evolve ANNs with
more than one hidden-layer and multiple output nodes there is the need to know
the number of neurons available in previous layers. In this paper we introduce
Dynamic Structured Grammatical Evolution (DSGE): a new genotypic representation
that overcomes the aforementioned limitations. By enabling the creation of
dynamic rules that specify the connection possibilities of each neuron, the
methodology enables the evolution of multi-layered ANNs with more than one
output neuron. Results in different classification problems show that DSGE
evolves effective single and multi-layered ANNs, with a varying number of
output neurons.

 <dc:description>  Phase retrieval refers to recovering a signal from its Fourier magnitude.
This problem arises naturally in many scientific applications, such as
ultra-short laser pulse characterization and diffraction imaging.
Unfortunately, phase retrieval is ill-posed for almost all one-dimensional
signals. In order to characterize a laser pulse and overcome the ill-posedness,
it is common to use a technique called Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating
(FROG). In FROG, the measured data, referred to as FROG trace, is the Fourier
magnitude of the product of the underlying signal with several translated
versions of itself. The FROG trace results in a system of phaseless quartic
Fourier measurements. In this paper, we prove that it suffices to consider only
three translations of the signal to determine almost all bandlimited signals,
up to trivial ambiguities. In practice, one usually also has access to the
signal's Fourier magnitude. We show that in this case only two translations
suffice. Our results significantly improve upon earlier work.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a margin-based multiclass generalization bound for neural
networks that scales with their margin-normalized &quot;spectral complexity&quot;: their
Lipschitz constant, meaning the product of the spectral norms of the weight
matrices, times a certain correction factor. This bound is empirically
investigated for a standard AlexNet network trained with SGD on the mnist and
cifar10 datasets, with both original and random labels; the bound, the
Lipschitz constants, and the excess risks are all in direct correlation,
suggesting both that SGD selects predictors whose complexity scales with the
difficulty of the learning task, and secondly that the presented bound is
sensitive to this complexity.

 <dc:description>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at creating realistic images
with complex models for which maximum likelihood is infeasible. However, the
convergence of GAN training has still not been proved. We propose a two
time-scale update rule (TTUR) for training GANs with stochastic gradient
descent on arbitrary GAN loss functions. TTUR has an individual learning rate
for both the discriminator and the generator. Using the theory of stochastic
approximation, we prove that the TTUR converges under mild assumptions to a
stationary local Nash equilibrium. The convergence carries over to the popular
Adam optimization, for which we prove that it follows the dynamics of a heavy
ball with friction and thus prefers flat minima in the objective landscape. For
the evaluation of the performance of GANs at image generation, we introduce the
&quot;Fr\'echet Inception Distance&quot; (FID) which captures the similarity of generated
images to real ones better than the Inception Score. In experiments, TTUR
improves learning for DCGANs and Improved Wasserstein GANs (WGAN-GP)
outperforming conventional GAN training on CelebA, CIFAR-10, SVHN, LSUN
Bedrooms, and the One Billion Word Benchmark.

 <dc:description>  A number of recent works have proposed techniques for end-to-end learning of
communication protocols among cooperative multi-agent populations, and have
simultaneously found the emergence of grounded human-interpretable language in
the protocols developed by the agents, all learned without any human
supervision!
  In this paper, using a Task and Tell reference game between two agents as a
testbed, we present a sequence of 'negative' results culminating in a
'positive' one -- showing that while most agent-invented languages are
effective (i.e. achieve near-perfect task rewards), they are decidedly not
interpretable or compositional.
  In essence, we find that natural language does not emerge 'naturally',
despite the semblance of ease of natural-language-emergence that one may gather
from recent literature. We discuss how it is possible to coax the invented
languages to become more and more human-like and compositional by increasing
restrictions on how two agents may communicate.

 <dc:description>  First-order linear real arithmetic enriched with uninterpreted predicate
symbols yields an interesting modeling language. However, satisfiability of
such formulas is undecidable, even if we restrict the uninterpreted predicate
symbols to arity one. In order to find decidable fragments of this language, it
is necessary to restrict the expressiveness of the arithmetic part. One
possible path is to confine arithmetic expressions to difference constraints of
the form $x - y \mathrel{\#} c$, where $\#$ ranges over the standard relations
$&lt;, \leq, =, \neq, \geq, &gt;$ and $x,y$ are universally quantified. However, it
is known that combining difference constraints with uninterpreted predicate
symbols yields an undecidable satisfiability problem again. In this paper, it
is shown that satisfiability becomes decidable if we in addition bound the
ranges of universally quantified variables. As bounded intervals over the reals
still comprise infinitely many values, a trivial instantiation procedure is not
sufficient to solve the problem.

 <dc:description>  Attack trees are a popular way to represent and evaluate potential security
threats on systems or infrastructures. The goal of this work is to provide a
framework allowing to express and check whether an attack tree is consistent
with the analyzed system. We model real systems using transition systems and
introduce attack trees with formally specified node labels. We formulate the
correctness properties of an attack tree with respect to a system and study the
complexity of the corresponding decision problems. The proposed framework can
be used in practice to assist security experts in manual creation of attack
trees and enhance development of tools for automated generation of attack
trees.

this article focuses on how to extract the largest subset of sequences in order

 <dc:description>  We identify conditional parity as a general notion of non-discrimination in
machine learning. In fact, several recently proposed notions of
non-discrimination, including a few counterfactual notions, are instances of
conditional parity. We show that conditional parity is amenable to statistical
analysis by studying randomization as a general mechanism for achieving
conditional parity and a kernel-based test of conditional parity.

 <dc:description>  We explore the power of semidefinite programming (SDP) for finding additive
$\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria in bimatrix games. We introduce an SDP
relaxation for a quadratic programming formulation of the Nash equilibrium (NE)
problem and provide a number of valid inequalities to improve the quality of
the relaxation. If a rank-1 solution to this SDP is found, then an exact NE can
be recovered. We show that for a (generalized) zero-sum game, our SDP is
guaranteed to return a rank-1 solution. Furthermore, we prove that if a rank-2
solution to our SDP is found, then a $\frac{5}{11}$-NE can be recovered for any
game, or a $\frac{1}{3}$-NE for a symmetric game. We propose two algorithms
based on iterative linearization of smooth nonconvex objective functions which
are designed to produce rank-1 solutions. Empirically, we show that these
algorithms often recover solutions of rank at most two and $\epsilon$ close to
zero. We then show how our SDP approach can address two (NP-hard) problems of
economic interest: finding the maximum welfare achievable under any NE, and
testing whether there exists a NE where a particular set of strategies is not
played. Finally, we show that by using the Lasserre/sum of squares hierarchy,
we can get an arbitrarily close spectrahedral outer approximation to the convex
hull of Nash equilibria, and that the SDP proposed in this paper dominates the
first level of the sum of squares hierarchy.

 <dc:description>  We treat the problem of autonomous acquisition of manipulation skills where
problem-solving strategies are initially available only for a narrow range of
situations. We propose to extend the range of solvable situations by autonomous
playing with the object. By applying previously-trained skills and behaviours,
the robot learns how to prepare situations for which a successful strategy is
already known. The information gathered during autonomous play is additionally
used to learn an environment model. This model is exploited for active learning
and the creative generation of novel preparatory behaviours. We apply our
approach on a wide range of different manipulation tasks, e.g. book grasping,
grasping of objects of different sizes by selecting different grasping
strategies, placement on shelves, and tower disassembly. We show that the
creative behaviour generation mechanism enables the robot to solve
previously-unsolvable tasks, e.g. tower disassembly. We use success statistics
gained during real-world experiments to simulate the convergence behaviour of
our system. Experiments show that active improves the learning speed by around
9 percent in the book grasping scenario.

 <dc:description>  Group synchronization requires to estimate unknown elements
$({\theta}_v)_{v\in V}$ of a compact group ${\mathfrak G}$ associated to the
vertices of a graph $G=(V,E)$, using noisy observations of the group
differences associated to the edges. This model is relevant to a variety of
applications ranging from structure from motion in computer vision to graph
localization and positioning, to certain families of community detection
problems.
  We focus on the case in which the graph $G$ is the $d$-dimensional grid.
Since the unknowns ${\boldsymbol \theta}_v$ are only determined up to a global
action of the group, we consider the following weak recovery question. Can we
determine the group difference ${\theta}_u^{-1}{\theta}_v$ between far apart
vertices $u, v$ better than by random guessing? We prove that weak recovery is
possible (provided the noise is small enough) for $d\ge 3$ and, for certain
finite groups, for $d\ge 2$. Viceversa, for some continuous groups, we prove
that weak recovery is impossible for $d=2$. Finally, for strong enough noise,
weak recovery is always impossible.

 <dc:description>  Return Oriented programming was surfaced first a decade ago, and was built to
overcome the buffer exploit defense mechanisms like ASLR, DEP (or W^ X) by
method of reusing the system code in the form of gadgets which are stitched
together to make a Turing complete attack. And to perform Turing complete
attack would require greater efforts which are quite complex, and there is very
little research available for performing a Turing complete attack. So, in this
project, we are systematizing the knowledge of the existing research that can
be used to perform a Turing complete ROP attack.

 <dc:title>Illuminating Pedestrians via Simultaneous Detection &amp; Segmentation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Pedestrian detection is a critical problem in computer vision with
significant impact on safety in urban autonomous driving. In this work, we
explore how semantic segmentation can be used to boost pedestrian detection
accuracy while having little to no impact on network efficiency. We propose a
segmentation infusion network to enable joint supervision on semantic
segmentation and pedestrian detection. When placed properly, the additional
supervision helps guide features in shared layers to become more sophisticated
and helpful for the downstream pedestrian detector. Using this approach, we
find weakly annotated boxes to be sufficient for considerable performance
gains. We provide an in-depth analysis to demonstrate how shared layers are
shaped by the segmentation supervision. In doing so, we show that the resulting
feature maps become more semantically meaningful and robust to shape and
occlusion. Overall, our simultaneous detection and segmentation framework
achieves a considerable gain over the state-of-the-art on the Caltech
pedestrian dataset, competitive performance on KITTI, and executes 2x faster
than competitive methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes our submission to the 2017 BioASQ challenge. We
participated in Task B, Phase B which is concerned with biomedical question
answering (QA). We focus on factoid and list question, using an extractive QA
model, that is, we restrict our system to output substrings of the provided
text snippets. At the core of our system, we use FastQA, a state-of-the-art
neural QA system. We extended it with biomedical word embeddings and changed
its answer layer to be able to answer list questions in addition to factoid
questions. We pre-trained the model on a large-scale open-domain QA dataset,
SQuAD, and then fine-tuned the parameters on the BioASQ training set. With our
approach, we achieve state-of-the-art results on factoid questions and
competitive results on list questions.

programming language for a fully general, first-order, initial-value problem.
Our implementation accepts both coarse and fine integrators as functional

as the integrators in our experiments. We also present a simulation of the
algorithm for purposes of pedagogy.

 <dc:description>  In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been
demonstrated successful for object detections. However, the size of network
input is limited by the amount of memory available on GPUs. Moreover,
performance degrades when detecting small objects. To alleviate the memory
usage and improve the performance of detecting small traffic signs, we proposed
an approach for detecting small traffic signs from large images under real
world conditions. In particular, large images are broken into small patches as
input to a Small-Object-Sensitive-CNN (SOS-CNN) modified from a Single Shot
Multibox Detector (SSD) framework with a VGG-16 network as the base network to
produce patch-level object detection results. Scale invariance is achieved by
applying the SOS-CNN on an image pyramid. Then, image-level object detection is
obtained by projecting all the patch-level detection results to the image at
the original scale. Experimental results on a real-world conditioned traffic
sign dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in
terms of detection accuracy and recall, especially for those with small sizes.

 <dc:description>  Recent progress in synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) technology and processing
has led to significant advances in underwater imaging, outperforming previously
common approaches in both accuracy and efficiency. There are, however, inherent
limitations to current SAS reconstruction methodology. In particular, popular
and efficient Fourier domain SAS methods require a 2D interpolation which is
often ill conditioned and inaccurate, inevitably reducing robustness with
regard to speckle and inaccurate sound-speed estimation. To overcome these
issues, we propose using the frame theoretic convolution gridding (FTCG)
algorithm to handle the non-uniform Fourier data. FTCG extends upon non-uniform
fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) algorithms by casting the NUFFT as an
approximation problem given Fourier frame data. The FTCG has been show to yield
improved accuracy at little more computational cost. Using simulated data, we
outline how the FTCG can be used to enhance current SAS processing.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a family of local feature aggregation functions and a
novel method to estimate their parameters, such that they generate optimal
representations for classification (or any task that can be expressed as a cost
function minimization problem). To achieve that, we compose the local feature
aggregation function with the classifier cost function and we backpropagate the
gradient of this cost function in order to update the local feature aggregation
function parameters. Experiments on synthetic datasets indicate that our method
discovers parameters that model the class-relevant information in addition to
the local feature space. Further experiments on a variety of motion and visual
descriptors, both on image and video datasets, show that our method outperforms
other state-of-the-art local feature aggregation functions, such as Bag of
Words, Fisher Vectors and VLAD, by a large margin.

 <dc:title>On structural properties of trees with minimal atom-bond connectivity
  index IV: Solving a conjecture about the pendent paths of length three</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dimitrov, Darko</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index is one of the most investigated
degree-based molecular structure descriptors with a variety of chemical
applications. It is known that among all connected graphs, the trees minimize
the ABC index. However, a full characterization of trees with a minimal ABC
index is still an open problem. By now, one of the proved properties is that a
tree with a minimal ABC index may have, at most, one pendent path of length
$3$, with the conjecture that it cannot be a case if the order of a tree is
larger than $1178$. Here, we provide an affirmative answer of a strengthened
version of that conjecture, showing that a tree with minimal ABC index cannot
contain a pendent path of length $3$ if its order is larger than $415$.

 <dc:title>Robust Sonar ATR Through Bayesian Pose Corrected Sparse Classification</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Raj, Raghu G.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sonar imaging has seen vast improvements over the last few decades due in
part to advances in synthetic aperture Sonar (SAS). Sophisticated
classification techniques can now be used in Sonar automatic target recognition
(ATR) to locate mines and other threatening objects. Among the most promising
of these methods is sparse reconstruction-based classification (SRC) which has
shown an impressive resiliency to noise, blur, and occlusion. We present a
coherent strategy for expanding upon SRC for Sonar ATR that retains SRC's
robustness while also being able to handle targets with diverse geometric
arrangements, bothersome Rayleigh noise, and unavoidable background clutter.
Our method, pose corrected sparsity (PCS), incorporates a novel interpretation
of a spike and slab probability distribution towards use as a Bayesian prior
for class-specific discrimination in combination with a dictionary learning
scheme for localized patch extractions. Additionally, PCS offers the potential
for anomaly detection in order to avoid false identifications of tested objects
from outside the training set with no additional training required. Compelling
results are shown using a database provided by the United States Naval Surface
Warfare Center.

 <dc:description>  Simulation Optimization (SO) refers to the optimization of an objective
function subject to constraints, both of which can be evaluated through a
stochastic simulation. To address specific features of a particular
simulation---discrete or continuous decisions, expensive or cheap simulations,
single or multiple outputs, homogeneous or heterogeneous noise---various
algorithms have been proposed in the literature. As one can imagine, there
exist several competing algorithms for each of these classes of problems. This
document emphasizes the difficulties in simulation optimization as compared to
mathematical programming, makes reference to state-of-the-art algorithms in the
field, examines and contrasts the different approaches used, reviews some of
the diverse applications that have been tackled by these methods, and
speculates on future directions in the field.

 <dc:title>Assortment Optimization under the General Luce Model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Flores, Alvaro</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies the assortment optimization problem under the General Luce
Model (GLM), a discrete choice introduced by Echenique and Saito (2015) that
generalizes the standard multinomial logit model (MNL). The GLM does not
satisfy the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) property but it
ensures that each product has an intrinsic utility and uses a dominance
relation between products. Given a proposed assortment $S$, consumers first
discard all dominated products in $S$ before using a MNL model on the remaining
products. The General Luce Model may violate the traditional regularity
condition, which states that the probability of choosing a product cannot
increase if the offer set is enlarged. As a result, the model can model
behaviour that cannot be captured by any discrete choice model based on random
utilities.
  The paper proves that the assortment problem under the GLM is
polynomially-solvable. Moreover, it proves that the capacitated assortment
optimization problem under the General Luce Model (GLM) is NP-hard and presents
polynomial-time algorithms for the cases where (1) the dominance relation is
utility-correlated and (2) its transitive reduction is a forest. The proofs
exploit a strong connection between assortments under the GLM and independent
sets in comparability graphs.

 <dc:description>  Optimization solvers routinely utilize presolve techniques, including model
simplification, reformulation and domain reduction techniques. Domain reduction
techniques are especially important in speeding up convergence to the global
optimum for challenging nonconvex nonlinear programming (NLP) and mixed-integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problems. In this work, we survey
the various techniques used for domain reduction of NLP and MINLP optimization
problems. We also present a computational analysis of the impact of these
techniques on the performance of various widely available global solvers on a
collection of 1740 test problems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the dynamics of contagious spreading processes taking
place in complex contact networks. We specifically present a lower-bound on the
decay rate of the number of nodes infected by a
susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) stochastic spreading process. A precise
quantification of this decay rate is crucial for designing efficient strategies
to contain epidemic outbreaks. However, existing lower-bounds on the decay rate
based on first-order mean-field approximations are often accompanied by a large
error resulting in inefficient containment strategies. To overcome this
deficiency, we derive a lower-bound based on a second-order moment-closure of
the stochastic SIS processes. The proposed second-order bound is theoretically
guaranteed to be tighter than existing first-order bounds. We also present
various numerical simulations to illustrate how our lower-bound drastically
improves the performance of existing first-order lower-bounds in practical
scenarios, resulting in more efficient strategies for epidemic containment.

 <dc:description>  Noisy data, non-convex objectives, model misspecification, and numerical
instability can all cause undesired behaviors in machine learning systems. As a
result, detecting actual implementation errors can be extremely difficult. We
demonstrate a methodology in which developers use an interactive proof
assistant to both implement their system and to state a formal theorem defining
what it means for their system to be correct. The process of proving this
theorem interactively in the proof assistant exposes all implementation errors
since any error in the program would cause the proof to fail. As a case study,
we implement a new system, Certigrad, for optimizing over stochastic
computation graphs, and we generate a formal (i.e. machine-checkable) proof
that the gradients sampled by the system are unbiased estimates of the true
mathematical gradients. We train a variational autoencoder using Certigrad and
find the performance comparable to training the same model in TensorFlow.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved unprecedented performance on a wide
range of complex tasks, rapidly outpacing our understanding of the nature of
their solutions. This has caused a recent surge of interest in methods for
rendering modern neural systems more interpretable. In this work, we propose to
address the interpretability problem in modern DNNs using the rich history of
problem descriptions, theories and experimental methods developed by cognitive
psychologists to study the human mind. To explore the potential value of these
tools, we chose a well-established analysis from developmental psychology that
explains how children learn word labels for objects, and applied that analysis
to DNNs. Using datasets of stimuli inspired by the original cognitive
psychology experiments, we find that state-of-the-art one shot learning models
trained on ImageNet exhibit a similar bias to that observed in humans: they
prefer to categorize objects according to shape rather than color. The
magnitude of this shape bias varies greatly among architecturally identical,
but differently seeded models, and even fluctuates within seeds throughout
training, despite nearly equivalent classification performance. These results
demonstrate the capability of tools from cognitive psychology for exposing
hidden computational properties of DNNs, while concurrently providing us with a
computational model for human word learning.

hold. For most of these extensions, the model-checking problem is undecidable,
but we show that decidability can be recovered by considering flat Kripke
structures where each state belongs to at most one simple loop. Most decision
procedures are based on results on (flat) counter systems where counters are
used to implement the evaluation of counting operators.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the association between musical chords and lyrics by analyzing
a large dataset of user-contributed guitar tablatures. Motivated by the idea
that the emotional content of chords is reflected in the words used in
corresponding lyrics, we analyze associations between lyrics and chord
categories. We also examine the usage patterns of chords and lyrics in
different musical genres, historical eras, and geographical regions. Our
overall results confirms a previously known association between Major chords
and positive valence. We also report a wide variation in this association
across regions, genres, and eras. Our results suggest possible existence of
different emotional associations for other types of chords.

 <dc:description>  Over the years complexity theorists have proposed many structural parameters
to explain the surprising efficiency of conflict-driven clause-learning (CDCL)
SAT solvers on a wide variety of large industrial Boolean instances. While some
of these parameters have been studied empirically, until now there has not been
a unified comparative study of their explanatory power on a comprehensive
benchmark. We correct this state of affairs by conducting a large-scale
empirical evaluation of CDCL SAT solver performance on nearly 7000 industrial
and crafted formulas against several structural parameters such as backdoors,
treewidth, backbones, and community structure.
  Our study led us to several results. First, we show that while such
parameters only weakly correlate with CDCL solving time, certain combinations
of them yield much better regression models. Second, we show how some
parameters can be used as a &quot;lens&quot; to better understand the efficiency of
different solving heuristics. Finally, we propose a new complexity-theoretic
parameter, which we call learning-sensitive with restarts (LSR) backdoors, that
extends the notion of learning-sensitive (LS) backdoors to incorporate restarts
and discuss algorithms to compute them. We mathematically prove that for
certain class of instances minimal LSR-backdoors are exponentially smaller than
minimal-LS backdoors.

 <dc:description>  Most existing datasets for speaker identification contain samples obtained
under quite constrained conditions, and are usually hand-annotated, hence
limited in size. The goal of this paper is to generate a large scale
text-independent speaker identification dataset collected 'in the wild'. We
make two contributions. First, we propose a fully automated pipeline based on
computer vision techniques to create the dataset from open-source media. Our
pipeline involves obtaining videos from YouTube; performing active speaker
verification using a two-stream synchronization Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and confirming the identity of the speaker using CNN based facial
recognition. We use this pipeline to curate VoxCeleb which contains hundreds of
thousands of 'real world' utterances for over 1,000 celebrities. Our second
contribution is to apply and compare various state of the art speaker
identification techniques on our dataset to establish baseline performance. We
show that a CNN based architecture obtains the best performance for both
identification and verification.

 <dc:description>  Crowding is a visual effect suffered by humans, in which an object that can
be recognized in isolation can no longer be recognized when other objects,
called flankers, are placed close to it. In this work, we study the effect of
crowding in artificial Deep Neural Networks for object recognition. We analyze
both standard deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as well as a new
version of DCNNs which is 1) multi-scale and 2) with size of the convolution
filters change depending on the eccentricity wrt to the center of fixation.
Such networks, that we call eccentricity-dependent, are a computational model
of the feedforward path of the primate visual cortex. Our results reveal that
the eccentricity-dependent model, trained on target objects in isolation, can
recognize such targets in the presence of flankers, if the targets are near the
center of the image, whereas DCNNs cannot. Also, for all tested networks, when
trained on targets in isolation, we find that recognition accuracy of the
networks decreases the closer the flankers are to the target and the more
flankers there are. We find that visual similarity between the target and
flankers also plays a role and that pooling in early layers of the network
leads to more crowding. Additionally, we show that incorporating the flankers
into the images of the training set does not improve performance with crowding.

 <dc:description>  Social media is considered a democratic space in which people connect and
interact with each other regardless of their gender, race, or any other
demographic factor. Despite numerous efforts that explore demographic factors
in social media, it is still unclear whether social media perpetuates old
inequalities from the offline world. In this paper, we attempt to identify
gender and race of Twitter users located in U.S. using advanced image
processing algorithms from Face++. Then, we investigate how different
demographic groups (i.e. male/female, Asian/Black/White) connect with other. We
quantify to what extent one group follow and interact with each other and the
extent to which these connections and interactions reflect in inequalities in
Twitter. Our analysis shows that users identified as White and male tend to
attain higher positions in Twitter, in terms of the number of followers and
number of times in user's lists. We hope our effort can stimulate the
development of new theories of demographic information in the online space.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we investigate the cost-effective 5G-enabled vehicular
networks to support emerging vehicular applications, such as autonomous
driving, in-car infotainment and location-based road services. To this end,
self-sustaining caching stations (SCSs) are introduced to liberate on-road base
stations from the constraints of power lines and wired backhauls. Specifically,
the cache-enabled SCSs are powered by renewable energy and connected to core
networks through wireless backhauls, which can realize &quot;drop-and-play&quot;
deployment, green operation, and low-latency services. With SCSs integrated, a
5G-enabled heterogeneous vehicular networking architecture is further proposed,
where SCSs are deployed along roadside for traffic offloading while
conventional macro base stations (MBSs) provide ubiquitous coverage to
vehicles. In addition, a hierarchical network management framework is designed
to deal with high dynamics in vehicular traffic and renewable energy, where
content caching, energy management and traffic steering are jointly
investigated to optimize the service capability of SCSs with balanced power
demand and supply in different time scales. Case studies are provided to
illustrate SCS deployment and operation designs, and some open research issues
are also discussed.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a simple spatial-temporal smoothness based method for
solving dense non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM). First, we revisit the
temporal smoothness and demonstrate that it can be extended to dense case
directly. Second, we propose to exploit the spatial smoothness by resorting to
the Laplacian of the 3D non-rigid shape. Third, to handle real world noise and
outliers in measurements, we robustify the data term by using the $L_1$ norm.
In this way, our method could robustly exploit both spatial and temporal
smoothness effectively and make dense non-rigid reconstruction easy. Our method
is very easy to implement, which involves solving a series of least squares
problems. Experimental results on both synthetic and real image dense NRSfM
tasks show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art dense
non-rigid reconstruction methods.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we have investigated the preservation of quantum Fisher
information of a single-qubit system coupled to a common zero temperature
reservoir through the addition of noninteracting qubits. The results show that,
the QFI is completely protected in both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes by
increasing the number of additional qubits. Besides, the phenomena of QFI
display monotonic decay or non-monotonic with revival oscillations depending on
the number of additional qubits in a common dissipative reservoir. Moreover, we
extend this model to investigate the effect of additional qubits N-1 and the
initial conditions of the system on the geometric phase. It is found that, the
robustness of GP against the dissipative reservoir has been demonstrated by
increasing gradually the number of additional qubits. Besides, the GP is
sensitive to the initial parameter theta, and possesses symmetric in a range
regime 0,2 pi.

 <dc:title>Isomorphism between Maximum Lyapunov Exponent and Shannon's Channel

 <dc:description>  We demonstrate that the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent for computable dynamical
systems is isomorphic to the maximum capacity of a noiseless, memoryless
channel in a Shannon communication model. The isomorphism allows the
understanding of Lyapunov exponents in the simplified terms of Information
Theory, rather than the traditional definitions in Chaos Theory. This work
provides a bridge between fundamental physics and Information Theory to the
mutual benefit of both fields. The result suggests, among other implications,
that machine learning and other information theory methods can be successfully
employed at the core of physics simulations.

 <dc:title>Dynamic backstepping control for pure-feedback nonlinear systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Sheng</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Qian, Wei-qi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A dynamic backstepping method is proposed to design controllers for nonlinear
systems in the pure-feedback form, for which the traditional backstepping
method suffers from solving the implicit nonlinear algebraic equation. The idea
of this method is to augment the (virtual) controls as states during each
recursive step. As new dynamics are included in the design, the resulting
controller is in the dynamic feedback form. Procedure of deriving the
controller is detailed, and one more Lyapunov design is executed in each step
compared with the traditional backstepping method. Under appropriate
assumptions, the proposed control scheme achieves the uniformly asymptotically
stability. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated by the stabilization
and tracking numerical examples.

 <dc:description>  NAND flash memory is ubiquitous in everyday life today because its capacity
has continuously increased and cost has continuously decreased over decades.
This positive growth is a result of two key trends: (1) effective process
technology scaling, and (2) multi-level (e.g., MLC, TLC) cell data coding.
Unfortunately, the reliability of raw data stored in flash memory has also
continued to become more difficult to ensure, because these two trends lead to
(1) fewer electrons in the flash memory cell (floating gate) to represent the
data and (2) larger cell-to-cell interference and disturbance effects. Without
mitigation, worsening reliability can reduce the lifetime of NAND flash memory.
As a result, flash memory controllers in solid-state drives (SSDs) have become
much more sophisticated: they incorporate many effective techniques to ensure
the correct interpretation of noisy data stored in flash memory cells.
  In this article, we review recent advances in SSD error characterization,
mitigation, and data recovery techniques for reliability and lifetime
improvement. We provide rigorous experimental data from state-of-the-art MLC
and TLC NAND flash devices on various types of flash memory errors, to motivate
the need for such techniques. Based on the understanding developed by the
experimental characterization, we describe several mitigation and recovery
techniques, including (1) cell-to-cell interference mitigation, (2) optimal
multi-level cell sensing, (3) error correction using state-of-the-art
algorithms and methods, and (4) data recovery when error correction fails. We
quantify the reliability improvement provided by each of these techniques.
Looking forward, we briefly discuss how flash memory and these techniques could
evolve into the future.

 <dc:title>A Unified approach for Conventional Zero-shot, Generalized Zero-shot and

 <dc:description>  Prevalent techniques in zero-shot learning do not generalize well to other
related problem scenarios. Here, we present a unified approach for conventional
zero-shot, generalized zero-shot and few-shot learning problems. Our approach
is based on a novel Class Adapting Principal Directions (CAPD) concept that
allows multiple embeddings of image features into a semantic space. Given an
image, our method produces one principal direction for each seen class. Then,
it learns how to combine these directions to obtain the principal direction for
each unseen class such that the CAPD of the test image is aligned with the
semantic embedding of the true class, and opposite to the other classes. This
allows efficient and class-adaptive information transfer from seen to unseen
classes. In addition, we propose an automatic process for selection of the most
useful seen classes for each unseen class to achieve robustness in zero-shot
learning. Our method can update the unseen CAPD taking the advantages of few
unseen images to work in a few-shot learning scenario. Furthermore, our method
can generalize the seen CAPDs by estimating seen-unseen diversity that
significantly improves the performance of generalized zero-shot learning. Our
extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently
achieves superior performance in zero-shot, generalized zero-shot and
few/one-shot learning problems.

 <dc:description>  Echocardiography is essential to modern cardiology. However, human
interpretation limits high throughput analysis, limiting echocardiography from
reaching its full clinical and research potential for precision medicine. Deep
learning is a cutting-edge machine-learning technique that has been useful in
analyzing medical images but has not yet been widely applied to
echocardiography, partly due to the complexity of echocardiograms' multi view,
multi modality format. The essential first step toward comprehensive computer
assisted echocardiographic interpretation is determining whether computers can
learn to recognize standard views. To this end, we anonymized 834,267
transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) images from 267 patients (20 to 96 years, 51
percent female, 26 percent obese) seen between 2000 and 2017 and labeled them
according to standard views. Images covered a range of real world clinical
variation. We built a multilayer convolutional neural network and used
supervised learning to simultaneously classify 15 standard views. Eighty
percent of data used was randomly chosen for training and 20 percent reserved
for validation and testing on never seen echocardiograms. Using multiple images
from each clip, the model classified among 12 video views with 97.8 percent
overall test accuracy without overfitting. Even on single low resolution
images, test accuracy among 15 views was 91.7 percent versus 70.2 to 83.5
percent for board-certified echocardiographers. Confusional matrices, occlusion
experiments, and saliency mapping showed that the model finds recognizable
similarities among related views and classifies using clinically relevant image
features. In conclusion, deep neural networks can classify essential
echocardiographic views simultaneously and with high accuracy. Our results
provide a foundation for more complex deep learning assisted echocardiographic
interpretation.

 <dc:description>  Video prediction has been an active topic of research in the past few years.
Many algorithms focus on pixel-level predictions, which generates results that
blur and disintegrate within a few frames. In this project, we use a
hierarchical approach for long-term video prediction. We aim at estimating
high-level structure in the input frame first, then predict how that structure
grows in the future. Finally, we use an image analogy network to recover a
realistic image from the predicted structure. Our method is largely adopted
from the work by Villegas et al. The method is built with a combination of
LSTMs and analogy-based convolutional auto-encoder networks. Additionally, in
order to generate more realistic frame predictions, we also adopt adversarial
loss. We evaluate our method on the Penn Action dataset, and demonstrate good
results on high-level long-term structure prediction.

 <dc:description>  We use an information-theoretic measure of linguistic similarity to
investigate the organization and evolution of scientific fields. An analysis of
almost 20M papers from the past three decades reveals that the linguistic
similarity is related but different from experts and citation-based
classifications, leading to an improved view on the organization of science. A
temporal analysis of the similarity of fields shows that some fields (e.g.,
computer science) are becoming increasingly central, but that on average the
similarity between pairs has not changed in the last decades. This suggests
that tendencies of convergence (e.g., multi-disciplinarity) and divergence
(e.g., specialization) of disciplines are in balance.

 <dc:description>  We develop fast spectral algorithms for tensor decomposition that match the
robustness guarantees of the best known polynomial-time algorithms for this
problem based on the sum-of-squares (SOS) semidefinite programming hierarchy.
  Our algorithms can decompose a 4-tensor with $n$-dimensional orthonormal
components in the presence of error with constant spectral norm (when viewed as
an $n^2$-by-$n^2$ matrix). The running time is $n^5$ which is close to linear
in the input size $n^4$.
  We also obtain algorithms with similar running time to learn sparsely-used
orthogonal dictionaries even when feature representations have constant
relative sparsity and non-independent coordinates.
  The only previous polynomial-time algorithms to solve these problem are based
on solving large semidefinite programs. In contrast, our algorithms are easy to
implement directly and are based on spectral projections and tensor-mode
rearrangements.
  Or work is inspired by recent of Hopkins, Schramm, Shi, and Steurer (STOC'16)
that shows how fast spectral algorithms can achieve the guarantees of SOS for
average-case problems. In this work, we introduce general techniques to capture
the guarantees of SOS for worst-case problems.

 <dc:description>  The atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index has been, in recent years, one of the
most actively studied vertex-degree-based graph invariants in chemical graph
theory. For a given graph $G$, the ABC index is defined as $\sum_{uv\in
E}\sqrt{\frac{d(u) +d(v)-2}{d(u)d(v)}}$, where $d(u)$ is the degree of vertex
$u$ in $G$ and $E(G)$ denotes the set of edges of $G$. In this paper we present
some new structural properties of trees with a minimal ABC index (also refer to
as a minimal-ABC tree), which is a step further towards understanding their
complete characterization. We show that a minimal-ABC tree cannot
simultaneously contain a $B_4$-branch and $B_1$ or $B_2$-branches.

 <dc:description>  Neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved notable performance recently.
However, this approach has not been widely applied to the translation task
between Chinese and Uyghur, partly due to the limited parallel data resource
and the large proportion of rare words caused by the agglutinative nature of
Uyghur. In this paper, we collect ~200,000 sentence pairs and show that with
this middle-scale database, an attention-based NMT can perform very well on
Chinese-Uyghur/Uyghur-Chinese translation. To tackle rare words, we propose a
novel memory structure to assist the NMT inference. Our experiments
demonstrated that the memory-augmented NMT (M-NMT) outperforms both the vanilla
NMT and the phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT). Interestingly,
the memory structure provides an elegant way for dealing with words that are
out of vocabulary.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we tackle the problem of visually predicting surface friction
for environments with diverse surfaces, and integrating this knowledge into
biped robot locomotion planning. The problem is essential for autonomous robot
locomotion since diverse surfaces with varying friction abound in the real
world, from wood to ceramic tiles, grass or ice, which may cause difficulties
or huge energy costs for robot locomotion if not considered. We propose to
estimate friction and its uncertainty from visual estimation of material
classes using convolutional neural networks, together with probability
distribution functions of friction associated with each material. We then
robustly integrate the friction predictions into a hierarchical (footstep and
full-body) planning method using chance constraints, and optimize the same
trajectory costs at both levels of the planning method for consistency. Our
solution achieves fully autonomous perception and locomotion on slippery
terrain, which considers not only friction and its uncertainty, but also
collision, stability and trajectory cost. We show promising friction prediction
results in real pictures of outdoor scenarios, and planning experiments on a
real robot facing surfaces with different friction.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the possibility of extending the non-functionally complete
logic of a collection of Boolean connectives by the addition of further Boolean
connectives that make the resulting set of connectives functionally complete.
More precisely, we will be interested in checking whether an axiomatization for
Classical Propositional Logic may be produced by merging Hilbert-style calculi
for two disjoint incomplete fragments of it. We will prove that the answer to
that problem is a negative one, unless one of the components includes only
top-like connectives.

 <dc:description>  Face detection methods have relied on face datasets for training. However,
existing face datasets tend to be in small scales for face learning in both
constrained and unconstrained environments. In this paper, we first introduce
our large-scale image datasets, Large-scale Labeled Face (LSLF) and noisy
Large-scale Labeled Non-face (LSLNF). Our LSLF dataset consists of a large
number of unconstrained multi-view and partially occluded faces. The faces have
many variations in color and grayscale, image quality, image resolution, image
illumination, image background, image illusion, human face, cartoon face,
facial expression, light and severe partial facial occlusion, make up, gender,
age, and race. Many of these faces are partially occluded with accessories such
as tattoos, hats, glasses, sunglasses, hands, hair, beards, scarves,
microphones, or other objects or persons. The LSLF dataset is currently the
largest labeled face image dataset in the literature in terms of the number of
labeled images and the number of individuals compared to other existing labeled
face image datasets. Second, we introduce our CrowedFaces and CrowedNonFaces
image datasets. The crowedFaces and CrowedNonFaces datasets include faces and
non-faces images from crowed scenes. These datasets essentially aim for
researchers to provide a large number of training examples with many variations
for large scale face learning and face recognition tasks.

 <dc:description>  The spectrum of a first-order sentence is the set of the cardinalities of its
finite models. In this paper, we consider the spectra of sentences over binary
relations that use at least three variables. We show that for every such
sentence $\Phi$, there is a sentence $\Phi'$ that uses the same number of
variables, but only one symmetric binary relation, such that its spectrum is
linearly proportional to the spectrum of $\Phi$. Moreover, the models of
$\Phi'$ are all bipartite graphs. As a corollary, we obtain that to settle
Asser's conjecture, i.e., whether the class of spectra is closed under
complement, it is sufficient to consider only sentences using only three
variables whose models are restricted to undirected bipartite graphs.

 <dc:title>Sensitivity analysis for network aggregative games</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Parise, Francesca</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigate the sensitivity of the Nash equilibrium of constrained network
aggregative games to changes in exogenous parameters affecting the cost
function of the players. This setting is motivated by two applications. The
first is the analysis of interventions by a social planner with a networked
objective function while the second is network routing games with atomic
players and information constraints. By exploiting a primal reformulation of a
sensitivity analysis result for variational inequalities, we provide a
characterization of the sensitivity of the Nash equilibrium that depends on
primal variables only. To derive this result we assume strong monotonicity of
the mapping associated with the game. As the second main result, we derive
sufficient conditions that guarantee this strong monotonicity property in
network aggregative games. These two characterizations allows us to
systematically study changes in the Nash equilibrium due to perturbations or
parameter variations in the two applications mentioned above.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a novel method for in-hand object recognition. The
method is composed of a grasp stabilization controller and two exploratory
behaviours to capture the shape and the softness of an object. Grasp
stabilization plays an important role in recognizing objects. First, it
prevents the object from slipping and facilitates the exploration of the
object. Second, reaching a stable and repeatable position adds robustness to
the learning algorithm and increases invariance with respect to the way in
which the robot grasps the object. The stable poses are estimated using a
Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We present experimental results showing that
using our method the classifier can successfully distinguish 30 objects.We also
compare our method with a benchmark experiment, in which the grasp
stabilization is disabled. We show, with statistical significance, that our
method outperforms the benchmark method.

 <dc:description>  Multi-Objective Optimization Problems (MOPs) have attracted growing attention
during the last decades. Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have
been extensively used to address MOPs because are able to approximate a set of
non-dominated high-quality solutions. The Multi-Objective Quadratic Assignment
Problem (mQAP) is a MOP. The mQAP is a generalization of the classical QAP
which has been extensively studied, and used in several real-life applications.
The mQAP is defined as having as input several flows between the facilities
which generate multiple cost functions that must be optimized simultaneously.
In this study, we propose PasMoQAP, a parallel asynchronous memetic algorithm
to solve the Multi-Objective Quadratic Assignment Problem. PasMoQAP is based on
an island model that structures the population by creating sub-populations. The
memetic algorithm on each island individually evolve a reduced population of
solutions, and they asynchronously cooperate by sending selected solutions to
the neighboring islands. The experimental results show that our approach
significatively outperforms all the island-based variants of the
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II. We show that PasMoQAP is a
suitable alternative to solve the Multi-Objective Quadratic Assignment Problem.

 <dc:title>Beyond Moore-Penrose Part II: The Sparse Pseudoinverse</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This is the second part of a two-paper series on generalized inverses that
minimize matrix norms. In Part II we focus on generalized inverses that are
minimizers of entrywise p norms whose main representative is the sparse
pseudoinverse for $p = 1$. We are motivated by the idea to replace the
Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse by a sparser generalized inverse which is in some
sense well-behaved. Sparsity implies that it is faster to apply the resulting
matrix; well-behavedness would imply that we do not lose much in stability with
respect to the least-squares performance of the MPP. We first address questions
of uniqueness and non-zero count of (putative) sparse pseu-doinverses. We show
that a sparse pseudoinverse is generically unique, and that it indeed reaches
optimal sparsity for almost all matrices. We then turn to proving our main
stability result: finite-size concentration bounds for the Frobenius norm of
p-minimal inverses for $1 $\le$ p $\le$ 2$. Our proof is based on tools from
convex analysis and random matrix theory, in particular the recently developed
convex Gaussian min-max theorem. Along the way we prove several results about
sparse representations and convex programming that were known folklore, but of
which we could find no proof.

 <dc:description>  We consider the downlink scenario of multiuser multiple-input-single-output
(MU-MISO) communication systems with constant envelope (CE) signals emitted
from each antenna. This results in energy efficient power amplifiers (PAs). We
propose a holistic CE precoding scheme based on the symbol-wise minimum squared
error (SMSE) criterion. Additionally, we analyze the distortions introduced by
low-resolution quantization to PSK for higher energy efficiency reasons. We
present three solution algorithms and examine their performance to decide for
the best pick for different quantization resolutions. Our results show that
good performance can be achieved with minimal loss compared to an ideal
unquantized case. Finally, we analyze and discuss the results and consider the
overall complexity of the precoder as well as implementation issues.

gaining more interest in massive MIMO systems for economical and computational
efficiency. We present a new precoding technique to mitigate the
inter-user-interference (IUI) and the channel distortions in a 1-bit downlink
MUMISO system with QPSK symbols. The transmit signal vector is optimized taking
into account the 1-bit quantization. We develop a sort of mapping based on a
look-up table (LUT) between the input signal and the transmit signal. The LUT
is updated for each channel realization. Simulation results show a significant
gain in terms of the uncoded bit-error-ratio (BER) compared to the existing
linear precoding techniques.

 <dc:description>  Improving the power efficiency and spectral efficiency of communication
systems has been one of the major research goals over the recent years.
However, there is a tradeoff in achieving both goals at the same time. In this
work, we consider the joint optimization of the power amplifier and a pulse
shaping filter over a single-input single-output (SISO) additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) channel using 1-bit analog-todigital (ADC) and digital-to-analog
(DAC) converters. The goal of the optimization is the selection of the optimal
system parameters in order to maximize the desired figure-of-merit (FOM) which
is the product of power efficiency and spectral efficiency. Simulation results
give an insight in choosing the optimal parameters of the pulse shaping filter
and power amplifier to maximize the desired FOM.

 <dc:description>  Unlike standard cameras that send intensity images at a constant frame rate,
event-driven cameras asynchronously report pixel-level brightness changes,
offering low latency and high temporal resolution (both in the order of
micro-seconds). As such, they have great potential for fast and low power
vision algorithms for robots. Visual tracking, for example, is easily achieved
even for very fast stimuli, as only moving objects cause brightness changes.
However, cameras mounted on a moving robot are typically non-stationary and the
same tracking problem becomes confounded by background clutter events due to
the robot ego-motion. In this paper, we propose a method for segmenting the
motion of an independently moving object for event-driven cameras. Our method
detects and tracks corners in the event stream and learns the statistics of
their motion as a function of the robot's joint velocities when no
independently moving objects are present. During robot operation, independently
moving objects are identified by discrepancies between the predicted corner
velocities from ego-motion and the measured corner velocities. We validate the
algorithm on data collected from the neuromorphic iCub robot. We achieve a
precision of ~ 90 % and show that the method is robust to changes in speed of
both the head and the target.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel linear minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) precoder design
for a downlink (DL) massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) scenario. For
economical and computational efficiency reasons low resolution 1-bit
digital-to-analog (DAC) and analog-to-digital (ADC) converters are used. This
comes at the cost of performance gain that can be recovered by the large number
of antennas deployed at the base station (BS) and an appropiate precoder design
to mitigate the distortions due to the coarse quantization. The proposed
precoder takes the quantization non-linearities into account and is split into
a digital precoder and an analog precoder. We formulate the two-stage precoding
problem such that the MSE of the users is minimized under the 1-bit constraint.
In the simulations, we compare the new optimized precoding scheme with
previously proposed linear precoders in terms of uncoded bit error ratio (BER).

 <dc:description>  Filter bank based multicarrier with Offset-QAM systems (FBMC/OQAM) are strong
candidates for the waveform of future 5-th generation (5G) wireless standards.
These systems can achieve maximum spectral efficiency compared to other
multicarrier schemes, particularly in highly frequency selective propagation
conditions. In this case a multi-tap, fractionally spaced equalizer or precoder
needs to be inserted in each subcarrier at the receiver or transmitter side to
compensate inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference
(ICI). In this paper we propose a new Tomlinson-Harashima precoder (THP) design
for FBMC/OQAM based on the mean squared error (MSE) duality from a minimum MSE
(MMSE) designed decision feedback equalizer (DFE).

 <dc:description>  We consider a downlink 1-bit quantized multiuser (MU)
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system, where 1-bit digital-to-analog
(DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are used at the transmitter and
the receiver for economical and computational efficiency. We end up with a
discrete memoryless channel with input and output vectors belonging to the QPSK
constellation. In the context of massive (MIMO) systems the number of base
station (BS) antennas is much larger than the number of receive antennas. This
leads to high input cardinality of the channel. In this work we introduce a
method to reduce the input set based on the mimimum bit-error-ratio (BER)
criterion combined with a non-linear precoding technique. This method is
denoted as spatial coding. Simulations show that this spatial coding improves
the BER behavior significantly removing the error floor due to coarse
quantization.

 <dc:description>  This study investigated typical performance of approximation algorithms known
as belief propagation, greedy algorithm, and linear-programming relaxation for
maximum coverage problems on sparse biregular random graphs. After using the
cavity method for a corresponding hard-core lattice--gas model, results show
that two distinct thresholds of replica-symmetry and its breaking exist in the
typical performance threshold of belief propagation. In the low-density region,
the superiority of three algorithms in terms of a typical performance threshold
is obtained by some theoretical analyses. Although the greedy algorithm and
linear-programming relaxation have the same approximation ratio in worst-case
performance, their typical performance thresholds are mutually different,
indicating the importance of typical performance. Results of numerical
simulations validate the theoretical analyses and imply further mutual
relations of approximation algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We aim at investigating the impact of low resolution digital-to-analog
converters (DACs) at the transmitter and low resolution analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) at the receiver on the required bandwidth and the required
signalto- noise ratio (SNR). In particular, we consider the extreme case of
only 1-bit resolution (with oversampling), where we propose a single carrier
system architecture for minimizing the spectral occupation and the required SNR
of 1-bit signals. In addition, the receiver is optimized to take into account
the effects of quantization at both ends. Through simulations, we show that
despite of the coarse quantization, sufficient spectral confinement is still
achievable.

 <dc:description>  This dissertation focuses on fountain codes under maximum likelihood (ML)
decoding. First LT codes are considered under a practical and widely used ML
decoding algorithm known as inactivation decoding. Different analysis
techniques are presented to characterize the decoding complexity. Next an upper
bound to the probability of decoding failure of Raptor codes under ML decoding
is provided. Then, the distance properties of an ensemble of fixed-rate Raptor
codes with linear random outer codes are analyzed. Finally, a novel class of
fountain codes is presented, which consists of a parallel concatenation of a
block code with a linear random fountain code.

 <dc:title>Beamforming and Scheduling for mmWave Downlink Sparse Virtual Channels
  With Non-Orthogonal and Orthogonal Multiple Access</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Brighente, Alessandro</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tomasin, Stefano</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of scheduling and power allocation for the downlink
of a 5G cellular system operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band and
serving two sets of users: fix-rate (FR) users typically seen in
device-to-device (D2D) communications, and variable-rate (VR) users, or high
data rate services. The scheduling objective is the weighted sum-rate of both
FR and VR users, and the constraints ensure that active FR users get the
required rate. The weights of the objective function provide a trade-off
between the number of served FR users and the resources allocated to VR users.
For mmWave channels the virtual channel matrix obtained by applying fixed
discrete-Fourier transform (DFT) beamformers at both the transmitter and the
receiver is sparse. This results into a sparsity of the resulting multiple
access channel, which is exploited to simplify scheduling, first establishing
an interference graph among users and then grouping users according to their
orthogonality. The original scheduling problem is solved using a graph-coloring
algorithm on the interference graph in order to select sub-sets of orthogonal
VR users. Two options are considered for FR users: either they are chosen
orthogonal to VR users or non-orthogonal. A waterfilling algorithm is then used
to allocate power to the FR users.

 <dc:description>  Recent neural IR models have demonstrated deep learning's utility in ad-hoc
information retrieval. However, deep models have a reputation for being black
boxes, and the roles of a neural IR model's components may not be obvious at
first glance. In this work, we attempt to shed light on the inner workings of a
recently proposed neural IR model, namely the PACRR model, by visualizing the
output of intermediate layers and by investigating the relationship between
intermediate weights and the ultimate relevance score produced. We highlight
several insights, hoping that such insights will be generally applicable.

 <dc:title>Impulsive Sound Detection by a Novel Energy Formula and its Usage for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There are many methods proposed for the detection of impulsive sounds in
literature. Most of them are complex and require adaptation to ambient noise.
In this paper we propose a very simple and efficient method to detect impulsive
sounds. Although we use energy like most of the others to determine impulsive
sounds, the way we calculate the energy is quite different. Also our
calculation is immune to ambient noise and does not require any limit or
adaptation. We could detect impulsive sounds embedded in various kinds of
noises by using this formula.
  As our ultimate aim is to detect gunshots, next phase of impulsive sound
detection is gunshot recognition phase. Detected impulsive sounds are fed into
recognition phase in which we can decide on gunshots with high success rate.

 <dc:title>Centralized and Distributed Sparsification for Low-Complexity Message

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a promising technology for
fifth-generation (5G) cellular systems. However the burden imposed by the huge
amount of data to be collected (in the uplink) from the radio remote heads
(RRHs) and processed at the base band unit (BBU) poses serious challenges. In
order to reduce the computation effort of minimum mean square error (MMSE)
receiver at the BBU the Gaussian message passing (MP) together with a suitable
sparsification of the channel matrix can be used. In this paper we propose two
sets of solutions, either centralized or distributed ones. In the centralized
solutions, we propose different approaches to sparsify the channel matrix, in
order to reduce the complexity of MP. However these approaches still require
that all signals reaching the RRH are conveyed to the BBU, therefore the
communication requirements among the backbone network devices are unaltered. In
the decentralized solutions instead we aim at reducing both the complexity of
MP at the BBU and the requirements on the RRHs-BBU communication links by
pre-processing the signals at the RRH and convey a reduced set of signals to
the BBU.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel steganographic scheme based on chaotic iterations is
proposed. This research work takes place into the information hiding framework,
and focus more specifically on robust steganography. Steganographic algorithms
can participate in the development of a semantic web: medias being on the
Internet can be enriched by information related to their contents, authors,
etc., leading to better results for the search engines that can deal with such
tags. As media can be modified by users for various reasons, it is preferable
that these embedding tags can resist to changes resulting from some classical
transformations as for example cropping, rotation, image conversion, and so on.
This is why a new robust watermarking scheme for semantic search engines is
proposed in this document. For the sake of completeness, the robustness of this
scheme is finally compared to existing established algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Internet communication systems involving cryptography and data hiding often
require billions of random numbers. In addition to the speed of the algorithm,
the quality of the pseudo-random number generator and the ease of its
implementation are common practical aspects. In this work we will discuss how
to improve the quality of random numbers independently from their generation
algorithm. We propose an additional implementation technique in order to take
advantage of some chaotic properties. The statistical quality of our solution
stems from some well-defined discrete chaotic iterations that satisfy the
reputed Devaney's definition of chaos, namely the chaotic iterations technique.
Pursuing recent researches published in the previous International Conference
on Evolving Internet (Internet 09, 10, and 11), three methods to build
pseudorandom generators by using chaotic iterations are recalled. Using
standard criteria named NIST and DieHARD (some famous batteries of tests), we
will show that the proposed technique can improve the statistical properties of
a large variety of defective pseudorandom generators, and that the issues
raised by statistical tests decrease when the power of chaotic iterations
increase.

 <dc:description>  Compared to LiDAR-based localization methods, which provide high accuracy but
rely on expensive sensors, visual localization approaches only require a camera
and thus are more cost-effective while their accuracy and reliability typically
is inferior to LiDAR-based methods. In this work, we propose a vision-based
localization approach that learns from LiDAR-based localization methods by
using their output as training data, thus combining a cheap, passive sensor
with an accuracy that is on-par with LiDAR-based localization. The approach
consists of two deep networks trained on visual odometry and topological
localization, respectively, and a successive optimization to combine the
predictions of these two networks. We evaluate the approach on a new
challenging pedestrian-based dataset captured over the course of six months in
varying weather conditions with a high degree of noise. The experiments
demonstrate that the localization errors are up to 10 times smaller than with
traditional vision-based localization methods.

 <dc:description>  Social network analysis is a prominent approach to investigate interpersonal
relationships. Most studies use self-report data to quantify the connections
between participants and construct social networks. In recent years smartphones
have been used as an alternative to map networks by assessing the proximity
between participants based on Bluetooth and GPS data. While most studies have
handed out specially programmed smartphones to study participants, we developed
an application for iOS and Android to collect Bluetooth data from participants
own smartphones. In this study, we compared the networks estimated with the
smartphone app to those obtained from sociometric badges and self-report data.
Participants (n=21) installed the app on their phone and wore a sociometric
badge during office hours. Proximity data was collected for 4 weeks. A
contingency table revealed a significant association between proximity data
(rho = 0.17, p&lt;0.0001), but the marginal odds were higher for the app (8.6%)
than for the badges (1.3%), indicating that dyads were more often detected by
the app. We then compared the networks that were estimated using the proximity
and self-report data. All three networks were significantly correlated,
although the correlation with self-reported data was lower for the app (rho =
0.25) than for badges (rho = 0.67). The scanning rates of the app varied
considerably between devices and was lower on iOS than on Android. The
association between the app and the badges increased when the network was
estimated between participants whose app recorded more regularly. These
findings suggest that the accuracy of proximity networks can be further
improved by reducing missing data and restricting the interpersonal distance at
which interactions are detected.

 <dc:description>  A homomorphism from a graph G to a graph H is a function from the vertices of
G to the vertices of H that preserves edges. A homomorphism is surjective if it
uses all of the vertices of H and it is a compaction if it uses all of the
vertices of H and all of the non-loop edges of H. Hell and Nesetril gave a
complete characterisation of the complexity of deciding whether there is a
homomorphism from an input graph G to a fixed graph H. A complete
characterisation is not known for surjective homomorphisms or for compactions,
though there are many interesting results. Dyer and Greenhill gave a complete
characterisation of the complexity of counting homomorphisms from an input
graph G to a fixed graph H. In this paper, we give a complete characterisation
of the complexity of counting surjective homomorphisms from an input graph G to
a fixed graph H and we also give a complete characterisation of the complexity
of counting compactions from an input graph G to a fixed graph H. In an
addendum we use our characterisations to point out a dichotomy for the
complexity of the respective approximate counting problems (in the connected
case).

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the Chinese calligraphy synthesis problem:
synthesizing Chinese calligraphy images with specified style from standard
font(eg. Hei font) images (Fig. 1(a)). Recent works mostly follow the stroke
extraction and assemble pipeline which is complex in the process and limited by
the effect of stroke extraction. We treat the calligraphy synthesis problem as
an image-to-image translation problem and propose a deep neural network based
model which can generate calligraphy images from standard font images directly.
Besides, we also construct a large scale benchmark that contains various styles
for Chinese calligraphy synthesis. We evaluate our method as well as some
baseline methods on the proposed dataset, and the experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

 <dc:description>  In the present manuscript, we consider the practical problem of wave
interaction with a vertical wall. However, the novelty here consists in the
fact that the wall can move horizontally due to a system of springs. The water
wave evolution is described with the free surface potential flow model. Then, a
semi-analytical numerical method is presented. It is based on a mapping
technique and a finite difference scheme in the transformed domain. The idea is
to pose the equations on a fixed domain. This method is thoroughly tested and
validated in our study. By choosing specific values of spring parameters, this
system can be used to damp (or in other words to extract the energy of)
incident water waves.

symbolic computation methods for mixed systems of equalities and inequalities.
We demonstrate that those techniques benefit tremendously from a newly

 <dc:title>NOMA based Random Access with Multichannel ALOHA</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Choi, Jinho</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA), the power difference of multiple
signals is exploited for multiple access and successive interference
cancellation (SIC) is employed at a receiver to mitigate co-channel
interference. Thus, NOMA is usually employed for coordinated transmissions and
mostly applied to downlink transmissions where a base station (BS) per- forms
coordination for downlink transmissions with full channel state information
(CSI). In this paper, however, we show that NOMA can also be employed for
non-coordinated transmissions such as random access for uplink transmissions.
We apply a NOMA scheme to multichannel ALOHA and show that the throughput can
be improved. In particular, the resulting scheme is suitable for random access
when the number of subchannels is limited since NOMA can effectively increase
the number of subchannels without any bandwidth expansion.

 <dc:title>Approximate Reflection Symmetry in a Point Set: Theory and Algorithm

 <dc:creator>Nagar, Rajendra</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Raman, Shanmuganathan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose an algorithm to detect approximate reflection symmetry present in
a set of volumetrically distributed points belonging to $\mathbb{R}^d$
containing a distorted reflection symmetry pattern. We pose the problem of
detecting approximate reflection symmetry as the problem of establishing the
correspondences between the points which are reflections of each other and
determining the reflection symmetry transformation. We formulate an
optimization framework in which the problem of establishing the correspondences
amounts to solving a linear assignment problem and the problem of determining
the reflection symmetry transformation amounts to an optimization problem on a
smooth Riemannian product manifold. The proposed approach estimates the
symmetry from the distribution of the points and is descriptor independent. We
evaluate the robustness of our approach by varying the amount of distortion in
a perfect reflection symmetry pattern where we perturb each point by a
different amount of perturbation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method by applying it to the problem of 2-D reflection symmetry detection along
with relevant comparisons.

 <dc:title>The Individual Impact Index ($i^3$) Statistic: A Novel Article-Level
  Citation Metric</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Balayla, Jacques</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Citation metrics are analytic measures used to evaluate the usage, impact and
dissemination of scientific research. Traditionally, citation metrics have been
independently measured at each level of the publication pyramid, namely at the
article-level, at the author-level, and at the journal-level. The most commonly
used metrics have been focused on journal-level measurements, such as the
Impact Factor and the Eigenfactor, as well as on researcher-level metrics like
the Hirsch index (h-index) and i10 index. On the other hand, reliable
article-level metrics are less widespread, and are often reserved to
non-standardized and non-scientific characteristics of individual articles,
such as views, citations, downloads, and mentions in social and news media.
These characteristics are known as 'altmetrics'. However, when the number of
views and citations are similar between two articles, no discriminating measure
currently exists with which to assess and compare each articles' individual
impact. Given the modern, exponentially growing scientific literature,
scientists and readers of Science need optimized, reliable, objective methods
for managing, measuring and comparing research outputs and individual
publications. To this end, I hereby describe and propose a new standardized
article-level metric henceforth known as the 'Individual Impact Index
Statistic', or $i^3$ for short. The $i^3$ is a weighted algorithm that takes
advantage of the peer-review process, and considers a number of characteristics
of individual scientific publications in order to yield a standardized and
readily comparable measure of impact and dissemination. The strengths,
limitations, and potential uses of this novel metric are also discussed.

 <dc:description>  Action recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision with a lot of
potential applications such as video surveillance, human computer interaction,
and robot learning. Given pre-segmented videos, the task is to recognize
actions happening within videos. Historically, hand crafted video features were
used to address the task of action recognition. With the success of Deep
ConvNets as an image analysis method, a lot of extensions of standard ConvNets
were purposed to process variable length video data. In this work, we propose a
novel recurrent ConvNet architecture called recurrent residual networks to
address the task of action recognition. The approach extends ResNet, a state of
the art model for image classification. While the original formulation of
ResNet aims at learning spatial residuals in its layers, we extend the approach
by introducing recurrent connections that allow to learn a spatio-temporal
residual. In contrast to fully recurrent networks, our temporal connections
only allow a limited range of preceding frames to contribute to the output for
the current frame, enabling efficient training and inference as well as
limiting the temporal context to a reasonable local range around each frame. On
a large-scale action recognition dataset, we show that our model improves over
both, the standard ResNet architecture and a ResNet extended by a fully
recurrent layer.

 <dc:description>  Traditional linear methods for forecasting multivariate time series are not
able to satisfactorily model the non-linear dependencies that may exist in
non-Gaussian series. We build on the theory of learning vector-valued functions
in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and develop a method for learning
prediction functions that accommodate such non-linearities. The method not only
learns the predictive function but also the matrix-valued kernel underlying the
function search space directly from the data. Our approach is based on learning
multiple matrix-valued kernels, each of those composed of a set of input
kernels and a set of output kernels learned in the cone of positive
semi-definite matrices. In addition to superior predictive performance in the
presence of strong non-linearities, our method also recovers the hidden dynamic
relationships between the series and thus is a new alternative to existing
graphical Granger techniques.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things (IoT) sparks a whole new world of embedded
applications. Most of these applications are based on deeply embedded systems
that have to operate on limited or unreliable sources of energy, such as
batteries or energy harvesters. Meeting the energy requirements for such
applications is a hard challenge, which threatens the future growth of the IoT.
Software has the ultimate control over hardware. Therefore, its role is
significant in optimizing the energy consumption of a system. Currently,
programmers have no feedback on how their software affects the energy
consumption of a system. Such feedback can be enabled by energy transparency, a
concept that makes a program's energy consumption visible, from hardware to
software. This paper discusses the need for energy transparency in software
development and emphasizes on how such transparency can be realized to help
tackling the IoT energy challenge.

 <dc:description>  In this paper a feature extractor based on Gabor frames and Mallat's
scattering transform, called Gabor scattering, is introduced. This feature
extractor is applied to a simple signal model for audio signals, i.e. a class
of tones consisting of fundamental frequency and its multiples and an according
envelope. Within different layers, different invariances to certain signal
features occur. In this paper we give a mathematical explanation for the first
and the second layer which are illustrated by numerical examples. Deformation
stability of this feature extractor will be shown by using a decoupling
technique, previously suggested for the scattering transform of Cartoon
functions. Here it is used to see if the feature extractor is robust to changes
in spectral shape and frequency modulation.

 <dc:description>  Inspired by the tremendous success of deep Convolutional Neural Networks as
generic feature extractors for images, we propose TimeNet: a deep recurrent
neural network (RNN) trained on diverse time series in an unsupervised manner
using sequence to sequence (seq2seq) models to extract features from time
series. Rather than relying on data from the problem domain, TimeNet attempts
to generalize time series representation across domains by ingesting time
series from several domains simultaneously. Once trained, TimeNet can be used
as a generic off-the-shelf feature extractor for time series. The
representations or embeddings given by a pre-trained TimeNet are found to be
useful for time series classification (TSC). For several publicly available
datasets from UCR TSC Archive and an industrial telematics sensor data from
vehicles, we observe that a classifier learned over the TimeNet embeddings
yields significantly better performance compared to (i) a classifier learned
over the embeddings given by a domain-specific RNN, as well as (ii) a nearest
neighbor classifier based on Dynamic Time Warping.

 <dc:description>  The remarkable development of deep learning in medicine and healthcare domain
presents obvious privacy issues, when deep neural networks are built on users'
personal and highly sensitive data, e.g., clinical records, user profiles,
biomedical images, etc. However, only a few scientific studies on preserving
privacy in deep learning have been conducted. In this paper, we focus on
developing a private convolutional deep belief network (pCDBN), which
essentially is a convolutional deep belief network (CDBN) under differential
privacy. Our main idea of enforcing epsilon-differential privacy is to leverage
the functional mechanism to perturb the energy-based objective functions of
traditional CDBNs, rather than their results. One key contribution of this work
is that we propose the use of Chebyshev expansion to derive the approximate
polynomial representation of objective functions. Our theoretical analysis
shows that we can further derive the sensitivity and error bounds of the
approximate polynomial representation. As a result, preserving differential
privacy in CDBNs is feasible. We applied our model in a health social network,
i.e., YesiWell data, and in a handwriting digit dataset, i.e., MNIST data, for
human behavior prediction, human behavior classification, and handwriting digit
recognition tasks. Theoretical analysis and rigorous experimental evaluations
show that the pCDBN is highly effective. It significantly outperforms existing
solutions.

 <dc:description>  One major obstacle towards AI is the poor ability of models to solve new
problems quicker, and without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. To
better understand this issue, we study the problem of continual learning, where
the model observes, once and one by one, examples concerning a sequence of
tasks. First, we propose a set of metrics to evaluate models learning over a
continuum of data. These metrics characterize models not only by their test
accuracy, but also in terms of their ability to transfer knowledge across
tasks. Second, we propose a model for continual learning, called Gradient
Episodic Memory (GEM) that alleviates forgetting, while allowing beneficial
transfer of knowledge to previous tasks. Our experiments on variants of the
MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate the strong performance of GEM when
compared to the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  We present an efficient algorithm for recent generalizations of optimal mass
transport theory to matrix-valued and vector-valued densities. These
generalizations lead to several applications including diffusion tensor
imaging, color images processing, and multi-modality imaging. The algorithm is
based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP). By approximating the Hessian
of the cost and solving each iteration in an inexact manner, we are able to
solve each iteration with relatively low cost while still maintaining a fast
convergent rate. The core of the algorithm is solving a weighted Poisson
equation, where different efficient preconditioners may be employed. We utilize
incomplete Cholesky factorization, which yields an efficient and
straightforward solver for our problem. Several illustrative examples are
presented for both the matrix and vector-valued cases.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the expressive power and the algorithmic
properties of weighted expressions, which define functions from finite words to
integers. First, we consider a slight extension of an expression formalism,
introduced by Chatterjee. et. al. in the context of infinite words, by which to
combine values given by unambiguous (max,+)-automata, using Presburger
arithmetic. We show that important decision problems such as emptiness,
universality and comparison are PSpace-c for these expressions. We then
investigate the extension of these expressions with Kleene star. This allows to
iterate an expression over smaller fragments of the input word, and to combine
the results by taking their iterated sum. The decision problems turn out to be
undecidable, but we introduce the decidable and still expressive class of
synchronised expressions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we examine the statistical soundness of comparative
assessments within the field of recommender systems in terms of reliability and
human uncertainty. From a controlled experiment, we get the insight that users
provide different ratings on same items when repeatedly asked. This volatility
of user ratings justifies the assumption of using probability densities instead
of single rating scores. As a consequence, the well-known accuracy metrics
(e.g. MAE, MSE, RMSE) yield a density themselves that emerges from convolution
of all rating densities. When two different systems produce different RMSE
distributions with significant intersection, then there exists a probability of
error for each possible ranking. As an application, we examine possible ranking
errors of the Netflix Prize. We are able to show that all top rankings are more
or less subject to high probabilities of error and that some rankings may be
deemed to be caused by mere chance rather than system quality.

 <dc:description>  Modern DRAM modules are often equipped with hardware error correction
capabilities, especially for DRAM deployed in large-scale data centers, as
process technology scaling has increased the susceptibility of these devices to
errors. To provide fast error detection and correction, error-correcting codes
(ECC) are placed on an additional DRAM chip in a DRAM module. This additional
chip expands the raw capacity of a DRAM module by 12.5%, but the applications
are unable to use any of this extra capacity, as it is used exclusively to
provide reliability for all data. In reality, there are a number of
applications that do not need such strong reliability for all their data
regions (e.g., some user batch jobs executing on a public cloud), and can
instead benefit from using additional DRAM capacity to store extra data. Our
goal in this work is to provide the additional capacity within an ECC DRAM
module to applications when they do not need the high reliability of error
correction.
  In this paper, we propose Capacity- and Reliability-Adaptive Memory (CREAM),
a hardware mechanism that adapts error correcting DRAM modules to offer
multiple levels of error protection, and provides the capacity saved from using
weaker protection to applications. For regions of memory that do not require
strong error correction, we either provide no ECC protection or provide error
detection using multibit parity. We evaluate several layouts for arranging the
data within ECC DRAM in these reduced-protection modes, taking into account the
various trade-offs exposed from exploiting the extra chip. Our experiments show
that the increased capacity provided by CREAM improves performance by 23.0% for
a memory caching workload, and by 37.3% for a commercial web search workload
executing production query traces. In addition, CREAM can increase bank-level
parallelism within DRAM, offering further performance improvements.

 <dc:description>  Many future wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things are expected
to follow a software defined paradigm, where protocol parameters and behaviors
will be dynamically tuned as a function of the signal statistics. New protocols
will be then injected as a software as certain events occur. For instance, new
data compressors could be (re)programmed on-the-fly as the monitored signal
type or its statistical properties change. We consider a lossy compression
scenario, where the application tolerates some distortion of the gathered
signal in return for improved energy efficiency. To reap the full benefits of
this paradigm, we discuss an automatic sensor profiling approach where the
signal class, and in particular the corresponding rate-distortion curve, is
automatically assessed using machine learning tools (namely, support vector
machines and neural networks). We show that this curve can be reliably
estimated on-the-fly through the computation of a small number (from ten to
twenty) of statistical features on time windows of a few hundreds samples.

collection of evidence, it is vital for forensic practitioners to possess an
up-to-date knowledge about artefacts of forensic interest from various instant
messaging apps. Hence, in this chapter, we study America Online Instant
Messenger (version 7.14.5.8) with the aims of contributing to an in-depth
understanding of the types of terrestrial artefacts that are likely to remain
after the use of instant messaging services and app on Windows 8.1 devices.
Potential artefacts identified during the research include data relating to the
installation or uninstallation, log-in and log-off information, contact lists,

 <dc:description>  We view a neural network as a distributed system of which neurons can fail
independently, and we evaluate its robustness in the absence of any (recovery)
learning phase. We give tight bounds on the number of neurons that can fail
without harming the result of a computation. To determine our bounds, we
leverage the fact that neural activation functions are Lipschitz-continuous.
Our bound is on a quantity, we call the \textit{Forward Error Propagation},
capturing how much error is propagated by a neural network when a given number
of components is failing, computing this quantity only requires looking at the
topology of the network, while experimentally assessing the robustness of a
network requires the costly experiment of looking at all the possible inputs
and testing all the possible configurations of the network corresponding to
different failure situations, facing a discouraging combinatorial explosion.
  We distinguish the case of neurons that can fail and stop their activity
(crashed neurons) from the case of neurons that can fail by transmitting
arbitrary values (Byzantine neurons). Interestingly, as we show in the paper,
our bound can easily be extended to the case where synapses can fail.
  We show how our bound can be leveraged to quantify the effect of memory cost
reduction on the accuracy of a neural network, to estimate the amount of
information any neuron needs from its preceding layer, enabling thereby a
boosting scheme that prevents neurons from waiting for unnecessary signals. We
finally discuss the trade-off between neural networks robustness and learning
cost.

 <dc:description>  Wayfinding signs play an important role in guiding users to navigate in a
virtual environment and in helping pedestrians to find their ways in a
real-world architectural site. Conventionally, the wayfinding design of a
virtual environment is created manually, so as the wayfinding design of a
real-world architectural site. The many possible navigation scenarios, as well
as the interplay between signs and human navigation, can make the manual design
process overwhelming and non-trivial. As a result, creating a wayfinding design
for a typical layout can take months to several years. In this paper, we
introduce the Way to Go! approach for automatically generating a wayfinding
design for a given layout. The designer simply has to specify some navigation
scenarios; our approach will automatically generate an optimized wayfinding
design with signs properly placed considering human agents' visibility and
possibility of making mistakes during a navigation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in generating wayfinding designs for different
layouts such as a train station, a downtown and a canyon. We evaluate our
results by comparing different wayfinding designs and show that our optimized
wayfinding design can guide pedestrians to their destinations effectively and
efficiently. Our approach can also help the designer visualize the
accessibility of a destination from different locations, and correct any &quot;blind
zone&quot; with additional signs.

 <dc:description>  The paper deals with the adaptation of a new measure for the unsupervised
feature selection problems. The proposed measure is based on space filling
concept and is called the coverage measure. This measure was used for judging
the quality of an experimental space filling design. In the present work, the
coverage measure is adapted for selecting the smallest informative subset of
variables by reducing redundancy in data. This paper proposes a simple analogy
to apply this measure. It is implemented in a filter algorithm for unsupervised
feature selection problems.
  The proposed filter algorithm is robust with high dimensional data and can be
implemented without extra parameters. Further, it is tested with simulated data
and real world case studies including environmental data and hyperspectral
image. Finally, the results are evaluated by using random forest algorithm.

 <dc:description>  For over a decade, scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have
been recording measurements from the Martian surface as a part of the Mars
Exploration Rovers mission. One quantity of interest has been the opacity of
Mars's atmosphere for its importance in day-to-day estimations of the amount of
power available to the rover from its solar arrays. This paper proposes the use
of neural networks as a method for forecasting Martian atmospheric opacity that
is more effective than the current empirical model. The more accurate
prediction provided by these networks would allow operators at JPL to make more
accurate predictions of the amount of energy available to the rover when they
plan activities for coming sols.

 <dc:description>  Across a majority of pedestrian detection datasets, it is typically assumed
that pedestrians will be standing upright with respect to the image coordinate
system. This assumption, however, is not always valid for many vision-equipped
mobile platforms such as mobile phones, UAVs or construction vehicles on rugged
terrain. In these situations, the motion of the camera can cause images of
pedestrians to be captured at extreme angles. This can lead to very poor
pedestrian detection performance when using standard pedestrian detectors. To
address this issue, we propose a Rotational Rectification Network (R2N) that
can be inserted into any CNN-based pedestrian (or object) detector to adapt it
to significant changes in camera rotation. The rotational rectification network
uses a 2D rotation estimation module that passes rotational information to a
spatial transformer network to undistort image features. To enable robust
rotation estimation, we propose a Global Polar Pooling (GP-Pooling) operator to
capture rotational shifts in convolutional features. Through our experiments,
we show how our rotational rectification network can be used to improve the
performance of the state-of-the-art pedestrian detector under heavy image
rotation by up to 45%

 <dc:description>  In a system of three stochastic variables, the Partial Information
Decomposition (PID) of Williams and Beer dissects the information that two
variables (sources) carry about a third variable (target) into nonnegative
information atoms that describe redundant, unique, and synergistic modes of
dependencies among the variables. However, the classification of the three
variables into two sources and one target limits the dependency modes that can
be quantitatively resolved, and does not naturally suit all systems. Here, we
extend the PID to describe trivariate modes of dependencies in full generality,
without introducing additional decomposition axioms or making assumptions about
the target/source nature of the variables. By comparing different PID lattices
of the same system, we unveil a finer PID structure made of seven nonnegative
information subatoms that are invariant to different target/source
classifications and that are sufficient to construct any PID lattice. This
finer structure naturally splits redundant information into two nonnegative
components: the source redundancy, which arises from the pairwise correlations
between the source variables, and the non-source redundancy, which does not,
and relates to the synergistic information the sources carry about the target.
The invariant structure is also sufficient to construct the system's entropy,
hence it characterizes completely all the interdependencies in the system.

 <dc:description>  This article presents a new class of Pseudorandom Number Generators. The
generators are based on traversing a n-cube where a Balanced Hamiltonian Cycle
has been removed. The construction of such generators is automatic for small
number of bits, but remains an open problem when this number becomes large. A
running example is used throughout the paper. Finally, first statistical
experiments of these generators are presented, they show how efficient and
promising the proposed approach seems.

 <dc:description>  Human Activity Recognition has witnessed a significant progress in the last
decade. Although a great deal of work in this field goes in recognizing normal
human activities, few studies focused on identifying motion in sports.
Recognizing human movements in different sports has high impact on
understanding the different styles of humans in the play and on improving their
performance. As deep learning models proved to have good results in many
classification problems, this paper will utilize deep learning to classify
cross-country skiing movements, known as gears, collected using a 3D
accelerometer. It will also provide a comparison between different deep
learning models such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks versus
standard multi-layer perceptron. Results show that deep learning is more
effective and has the highest classification accuracy.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we provide details of implementing a system for managing a
fleet of autonomous mobile robots (AMR) operating in a factory or a warehouse
premise. While the robots are themselves autonomous in its motion and obstacle
avoidance capability, the target destination for each robot is provided by a
global planner. The global planner and the ground vehicles (robots) constitute
a multi agent system (MAS) which communicate with each other over a wireless
network. Three different approaches are explored for implementation. The first
two approaches make use of the distributed computing based Networked Robotics
architecture and communication framework of Robot Operating System (ROS) itself
while the third approach uses Rapyuta Cloud Robotics framework for this
implementation. The comparative performance of these approaches are analyzed
through simulation as well as real world experiment with actual robots. These
analyses provide an in-depth understanding of the inner working of the Cloud
Robotics Platform in contrast to the usual ROS framework. The insight gained
through this exercise will be valuable for students as well as practicing
engineers interested in implementing similar systems else where. In the
process, we also identify few critical limitations of the current Rapyuta
platform and provide suggestions to overcome them.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents iterative Sequential Action Control (iSAC), a receding
horizon approach for control of nonlinear systems. The iSAC method has a
closed-form open-loop solution, which is iteratively updated between time steps
by introducing constant control values applied for short duration. Application
of a contractive constraint on the cost is shown to lead to closed-loop
asymptotic stability under mild assumptions. The effect of asymptotically
decaying disturbances on system trajectories is also examined. To demonstrate
the applicability of iSAC to a variety of systems and conditions, we employ
five different systems, including a 13-dimensional quaternion-based quadrotor.
Each system is tested in different scenarios, ranging from feasible and
infeasible trajectory tracking, to setpoint stabilization, with or without the
presence of external disturbances. Finally, limitations of this work are
discussed.

 <dc:description>  Trace norm regularization is a widely used approach for learning low rank
matrices. A standard optimization strategy is based on formulating the problem
as one of low rank matrix factorization which, however, leads to a non-convex
problem. In practice this approach works well, and it is often computationally
faster than standard convex solvers such as proximal gradient methods.
Nevertheless, it is not guaranteed to converge to a global optimum, and the
optimization can be trapped at poor stationary points. In this paper we show
that it is possible to characterize all critical points of the non-convex
problem. This allows us to provide an efficient criterion to determine whether
a critical point is also a global minimizer. Our analysis suggests an iterative
meta-algorithm that dynamically expands the parameter space and allows the
optimization to escape any non-global critical point, thereby converging to a
global minimizer. The algorithm can be applied to problems such as matrix
completion or multitask learning, and our analysis holds for any random
initialization of the factor matrices. Finally, we confirm the good performance
of the algorithm on synthetic and real datasets.

 <dc:description>  With a goal of understanding what drives generalization in deep networks, we
consider several recently suggested explanations, including norm-based control,
sharpness and robustness. We study how these measures can ensure
generalization, highlighting the importance of scale normalization, and making
a connection between sharpness and PAC-Bayes theory. We then investigate how
well the measures explain different observed phenomena.

 <dc:description>  We present a deep, fully convolutional neural network that learns to route a
circuit layout net with appropriate choice of metal tracks and wire class
combinations. Inputs to the network are the encoded layouts containing spatial
location of pins to be routed. After 15 fully convolutional stages followed by
a score comparator, the network outputs 8 layout layers (corresponding to 4
route layers, 3 via layers and an identity-mapped pin layer) which are then
decoded to obtain the routed layouts. We formulate this as a binary
segmentation problem on a per-pixel per-layer basis, where the network is
trained to correctly classify pixels in each layout layer to be 'on' or 'off'.
To demonstrate learnability of layout design rules, we train the network on a
dataset of 50,000 train and 10,000 validation samples that we generate based on
certain pre-defined layout constraints. Precision, recall and $F_1$ score
metrics are used to track the training progress. Our network achieves
$F_1\approx97\%$ on the train set and $F_1\approx92\%$ on the validation set.
We use PyTorch for implementing our model. Code is made publicly available at

 <dc:description>  Establishing a reliable communication infrastructure at an emergency site is
a crucial task for mission-critical and real-time public safety communications
(PSC). To this end, use of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has recently
received extensive interest for PSC to establish reliable connectivity in a
heterogeneous network (HetNet) environment. These UAVs can be deployed as
unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) as a part of HetNet infrastructure. In
this article, we explore the role of agile UABSs in LTE-Advanced HetNets by
applying 3GPP Release 11 further-enhanced inter-cell interference coordination
(FeICIC) and cell range expansion (CRE) techniques. Through simulations, we
compare the system-wide 5th percentile spectral efficiency (SE) when UABSs are
deployed in a hexagonal grid and when their locations are optimized using a
genetic algorithm, while also jointly optimizing the CRE and the FeICIC
parameters. Our simulation results show that at optimized UABS locations, the
3GPP Release 11 FeICIC with reduced power subframes can provide considerably
better 5th percentile SE than the 3GPP Release~10 with almost blank subframes.

 <dc:title>Strategyproof Mechanisms for Additively Separable Hedonic Games and

 <dc:description>  Additively separable hedonic games and fractional hedonic games have received
considerable attention. They are coalition forming games of selfish agents
based on their mutual preferences. Most of the work in the literature
characterizes the existence and structure of stable outcomes (i.e., partitions
in coalitions), assuming that preferences are given. However, there is little
discussion on this assumption. In fact, agents receive different utilities if
they belong to different partitions, and thus it is natural for them to declare
their preferences strategically in order to maximize their benefit. In this
paper we consider strategyproof mechanisms for additively separable hedonic
games and fractional hedonic games, that is, partitioning methods without
payments such that utility maximizing agents have no incentive to lie about
their true preferences. We focus on social welfare maximization and provide
several lower and upper bounds on the performance achievable by strategyproof
mechanisms for general and specific additive functions. In most of the cases we
provide tight or asymptotically tight results. All our mechanisms are simple
and can be computed in polynomial time. Moreover, all the lower bounds are
unconditional, that is, they do not rely on any computational or complexity
assumptions.

 <dc:description>  Multiplex networks describe a large number of complex social, biological and
transportation networks where a set of nodes is connected by links of different
nature and connotation. Here we uncover the rich community structure of
multiplex networks by associating a community to each multilink where the
multilinks characterize the connections existing between any two nodes of the
multiplex network. Our community detection method reveals the rich interplay
between the mesoscale structure of the multiplex networks and their
multiplexity. For instance some nodes can belong to many layers and few
communities while others can belong to few layers but many communities.
Moreover the multilink communities can be formed by a different number of
relevant layers. These results point out that mesoscopically there can be large
differences in the compressibility of multiplex networks.

 <dc:title>Cache-enabled Wireless Networks with Opportunistic Interference

 <dc:creator>He, Y.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Both caching and interference alignment (IA) are promising techniques for
future wireless networks. Nevertheless, most of existing works on cache-enabled
IA wireless networks assume that the channel is invariant, which is unrealistic
considering the time-varying nature of practical wireless environments. In this
paper, we consider realistic time-varying channels. Specifically, the channel
is formulated as a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC). The complexity of the
system is very high when we consider realistic FSMC models. Therefore, we
propose a novel big data reinforcement learning approach in this paper. Deep
reinforcement learning is an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm that
uses deep $Q$ network to approximate the $Q$ value-action function. Deep
reinforcement learning is used in this paper to obtain the optimal IA user
selection policy in cache-enabled opportunistic IA wireless networks.
Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed
scheme.

 <dc:description>  The CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 shared task on supervised morphological generation
required systems to be trained and tested in each of 52 typologically diverse
languages. In sub-task 1, submitted systems were asked to predict a specific
inflected form of a given lemma. In sub-task 2, systems were given a lemma and
some of its specific inflected forms, and asked to complete the inflectional
paradigm by predicting all of the remaining inflected forms. Both sub-tasks
included high, medium, and low-resource conditions. Sub-task 1 received 24
system submissions, while sub-task 2 received 3 system submissions. Following
the success of neural sequence-to-sequence models in the SIGMORPHON 2016 shared
task, all but one of the submissions included a neural component. The results
show that high performance can be achieved with small training datasets, so
long as models have appropriate inductive bias or make use of additional
unlabeled data or synthetic data. However, different biasing and data
augmentation resulted in disjoint sets of inflected forms being predicted
correctly, suggesting that there is room for future improvement.

 <dc:description>  A vertex or edge in a graph is critical if its deletion reduces the chromatic
number of the graph by 1. We consider the problems of deciding whether a graph
has a critical vertex or edge, respectively. We give a complexity dichotomy for
both problems restricted to $H$-free graphs, that is, graphs with no induced
subgraph isomorphic to $H$. Moreover, we show that an edge is critical if and
only if its contraction reduces the chromatic number by 1. Hence, we also
obtain a complexity dichotomy for the problem of deciding if a graph has an
edge whose contraction reduces the chromatic number by 1.

 <dc:description>  High-accuracy speech recognition is especially challenging when large
datasets are not available. It is possible to bridge this gap with careful and
knowledge-driven parsing combined with the biologically inspired CNN and the
learning guarantees of the Vapnik Chervonenkis (VC) theory. This work presents
a Shallow-CNN-HTSVM (Hierarchical Tree Support Vector Machine classifier)
architecture which uses a predefined knowledge-based set of rules with
statistical machine learning techniques. Here we show that gross errors present
even in state-of-the-art systems can be avoided and that an accurate acoustic
model can be built in a hierarchical fashion. The CNN-HTSVM acoustic model
outperforms traditional GMM-HMM models and the HTSVM structure outperforms a
MLP multi-class classifier. More importantly we isolate the performance of the
acoustic model and provide results on both the frame and phoneme level
considering the true robustness of the model. We show that even with a small
amount of data accurate and robust recognition rates can be obtained.

 <dc:title>The k-means-u* algorithm: non-local jumps and greedy retries improve

 <dc:creator>Fritzke, Bernd</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.5.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a new clustering algorithm called k-means-u* which in many cases
is able to significantly improve the clusterings found by k-means++, the
current de-facto standard for clustering in Euclidean spaces. First we
introduce the k-means-u algorithm which starts from a result of k-means++ and
attempts to improve it with a sequence of non-local &quot;jumps&quot; alternated by runs
of standard k-means. Each jump transfers the &quot;least useful&quot; center towards the
center with the largest local error, offset by a small random vector. This is
continued as long as the error decreases and often leads to an improved
solution. Occasionally k-means-u terminates despite obvious remaining
optimization possibilities. By allowing a limited number of retries for the
last jump it is frequently possible to reach better local minima. The resulting
algorithm is called k-means-u* and dominates k-means++ wrt. solution quality
which is demonstrated empirically using various data sets. By construction the
logarithmic quality bound established for k-means++ holds for k-means-u* as
well.

 <dc:description>  We study a strategic version of the multi-armed bandit problem, where each
arm is an individual strategic agent and we, the principal, pull one arm each
round. When pulled, the arm receives some private reward $v_a$ and can choose
an amount $x_a$ to pass on to the principal (keeping $v_a-x_a$ for itself). All
non-pulled arms get reward $0$. Each strategic arm tries to maximize its own
utility over the course of $T$ rounds. Our goal is to design an algorithm for
the principal incentivizing these arms to pass on as much of their private
rewards as possible.
  When private rewards are stochastically drawn each round ($v_a^t \leftarrow
D_a$), we show that:
  - Algorithms that perform well in the classic adversarial multi-armed bandit
setting necessarily perform poorly: For all algorithms that guarantee low
regret in an adversarial setting, there exist distributions $D_1,\ldots,D_k$
and an approximate Nash equilibrium for the arms where the principal receives
reward $o(T)$.
  - Still, there exists an algorithm for the principal that induces a game
among the arms where each arm has a dominant strategy. When each arm plays its
dominant strategy, the principal sees expected reward $\mu'T - o(T)$, where
$\mu'$ is the second-largest of the means $\mathbb{E}[D_{a}]$. This algorithm
maintains its guarantee if the arms are non-strategic ($x_a = v_a$), and also
if there is a mix of strategic and non-strategic arms.

 <dc:description>  For two positive integers $k$ and $\ell$, a $(k \times \ell)$-spindle is the
union of $k$ pairwise internally vertex-disjoint directed paths with $\ell$
arcs between two vertices $u$ and $v$. We are interested in the (parameterized)
complexity of several problems consisting in deciding whether a given digraph
contains a subdivision of a spindle, which generalize both the Maximum Flow and
Longest Path problems. We obtain the following complexity dichotomy: for a
fixed $\ell \geq 1$, finding the largest $k$ such that an input digraph $G$
contains a subdivision of a $(k \times \ell)$-spindle is polynomial-time
solvable if $\ell \leq 3$, and NP-hard otherwise. We place special emphasis on
finding spindles with exactly two paths and present FPT algorithms that are
asymptotically optimal under the ETH. These algorithms are based on the
technique of representative families in matroids, and use also color-coding as
a subroutine. Finally, we study the case where the input graph is acyclic, and
present several algorithmic and hardness results.

 <dc:description>  Current recommender systems largely focus on static, unstructured content. In
many scenarios, we would like to recommend content that has structure, such as
a trajectory of points-of-interests in a city, or a playlist of songs. Dubbed
Structured Recommendation, this problem differs from the typical structured
prediction problem in that there are multiple correct answers for a given
input. Motivated by trajectory recommendation, we focus on sequential
structures but in contrast to classical Viterbi decoding we require that valid
predictions are sequences with no repeated elements. We propose an approach to
sequence recommendation based on the structured support vector machine. For
prediction, we modify the inference procedure to avoid predicting loops in the
sequence. For training, we modify the objective function to account for the
existence of multiple ground truths for a given input. We also modify the
loss-augmented inference procedure to exclude the known ground truths.
Experiments on real-world trajectory recommendation datasets show the benefits
of our approach over existing, non-structured recommendation approaches.

 <dc:title>ROS Navigation Tuning Guide</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zheng, Kaiyu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The ROS navigation stack is powerful for mobile robots to move from place to
place reliably. The job of navigation stack is to produce a safe path for the
robot to execute, by processing data from odometry, sensors and environment
map. Maximizing the performance of this navigation stack requires some fine
tuning of parameters, and this is not as simple as it looks. One who is
sophomoric about the concepts and reasoning may try things randomly, and wastes
a lot of time.
  This article intends to guide the reader through the process of fine tuning
navigation parameters. It is the reference when someone need to know the &quot;how&quot;
and &quot;why&quot; when setting the value of key parameters. This guide assumes that the
reader has already set up the navigation stack and ready to optimize it. This
is also a summary of my work with the ROS navigation stack.

 <dc:description>  A descriptive approach for automatic generation of visual blends is
presented. The implemented system, the Blender, is composed of two components:
the Mapper and the Visual Blender. The approach uses structured visual
representations along with sets of visual relations which describe how the
elements (in which the visual representation can be decomposed) relate among
each other. Our system is a hybrid blender, as the blending process starts at
the Mapper (conceptual level) and ends at the Visual Blender (visual
representation level). The experimental results show that the Blender is able
to create analogies from input mental spaces and produce well-composed blends,
which follow the rules imposed by its base-analogy and its relations. The
resulting blends are visually interesting and some can be considered as
unexpected.

 <dc:title>Super-Resolution via Deep Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hayat, Khizar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The recent phenomenal interest in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) must
have made it inevitable for the super-resolution (SR) community to explore its
potential. The response has been immense and in the last three years, since the
advent of the pioneering work, there appeared too many works not to warrant a
comprehensive survey. This paper surveys the SR literature in the context of
deep learning. We focus on the three important aspects of multimedia - namely
image, video and multi-dimensions, especially depth maps. In each case, first
relevant benchmarks are introduced in the form of datasets and state of the art
SR methods, excluding deep learning. Next is a detailed analysis of the
individual works, each including a short description of the method and a
critique of the results with special reference to the benchmarking done. This
is followed by minimum overall benchmarking in the form of comparison on some
common dataset, while relying on the results reported in various works.

 <dc:description>  Immunogenicity is a major problem during the development of biotherapeutics
since it can lead to rapid clearance of the drug and adverse reactions. The
challenge for biotherapeutic design is therefore to identify mutants of the
protein sequence that minimize immunogenicity in a target population whilst
retaining pharmaceutical activity and protein function. Current approaches are
moderately successful in designing sequences with reduced immunogenicity, but
do not account for the varying frequencies of different human leucocyte antigen
alleles in a specific population and in addition, since many designs are
non-functional, require costly experimental post-screening. Here we report a
new method for de-immunization design using multi-objective combinatorial
optimization that simultaneously optimizes the likelihood of a functional
protein sequence at the same time as minimizing its immunogenicity tailored to
a target population. We bypass the need for three-dimensional protein structure
or molecular simulations to identify functional designs by automatically
generating sequences using probabilistic models that have been used previously
for mutation effect prediction and structure prediction. As proof-of-principle
we designed sequences of the C2 domain of Factor VIII and tested them
experimentally, resulting in a good correlation with the predicted
immunogenicity of our model.

 <dc:title>On Compatible Triangulations with a Minimum Number of Steiner Points</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Two vertex-labelled polygons are \emph{compatible} if they have the same
clockwise cyclic ordering of vertices. The definition extends to polygonal
regions (polygons with holes) and to triangulations---for every face, the
clockwise cyclic order of vertices on the boundary must be the same. It is
known that every pair of compatible $n$-vertex polygonal regions can be
extended to compatible triangulations by adding $O(n^2)$ Steiner points.
Furthermore, $\Omega(n^2)$ Steiner points are sometimes necessary, even for a
pair of polygons. Compatible triangulations provide piecewise linear
homeomorphisms and are also a crucial first step in morphing planar graph
drawings, aka &quot;2D shape animation&quot;. An intriguing open question, first posed by
Aronov, Seidel, and Souvaine in 1993, is to decide if two compatible polygons
have compatible triangulations with at most $k$ Steiner points. In this paper
we prove the problem to be NP-hard for polygons with holes. The question
remains open for simple polygons.

 <dc:title>Uniform Recovery Bounds for Structured Random Matrices in Corrupted

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of recovering an $s$-sparse signal
$\mathbf{x}^{\star}\in\mathbb{C}^n$ from corrupted measurements $\mathbf{y} =
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}^{\star}+\mathbf{z}^{\star}+\mathbf{w}$, where
$\mathbf{z}^{\star}\in\mathbb{C}^m$ is a $k$-sparse corruption vector whose
nonzero entries may be arbitrarily large and $\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{C}^m$ is a
dense noise with bounded energy. The aim is to exactly and stably recover the
sparse signal with tractable optimization programs. In this paper, we prove the
uniform recovery guarantee of this problem for two classes of structured
sensing matrices. The first class can be expressed as the product of a
unit-norm tight frame (UTF), a random diagonal matrix and a bounded columnwise
orthonormal matrix (e.g., partial random circulant matrix). When the UTF is
bounded (i.e. $\mu(\mathbf{U})\sim1/\sqrt{m}$), we prove that with high
probability, one can recover an $s$-sparse signal exactly and stably by $l_1$
minimization programs even if the measurements are corrupted by a sparse
vector, provided $m = \mathcal{O}(s \log^2 s \log^2 n)$ and the sparsity level
$k$ of the corruption is a constant fraction of the total number of
measurements. The second class considers randomly sub-sampled orthogonal matrix
(e.g., random Fourier matrix). We prove the uniform recovery guarantee provided
that the corruption is sparse on certain sparsifying domain. Numerous
simulation results are also presented to verify and complement the theoretical
results.

 <dc:description>  We present a semantic vector space model for capturing complex polyphonic
musical context. A word2vec model based on a skip-gram representation with
negative sampling was used to model slices of music from a dataset of
Beethoven's piano sonatas. A visualization of the reduced vector space using
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding shows that the resulting embedded
vector space captures tonal relationships, even without any explicit
information about the musical contents of the slices. Secondly, an excerpt of
the Moonlight Sonata from Beethoven was altered by replacing slices based on
context similarity. The resulting music shows that the selected slice based on
similar word2vec context also has a relatively short tonal distance from the
original slice.

 <dc:description>  Objective: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare disease, but is also
one of the most common motor neuron diseases, and people of all races and
ethnic backgrounds are affected. There is currently no cure. Brain computer
interfaces (BCIs) can establish a communication channel directly between the
brain and an external device by recognizing brain activities that reflect user
intent. Therefore, this technology could help ALS patients in promoting
functional independence through BCI-based speller systems and motor assistive
devices. Methods: In this paper, two kinds of ERP-based speller systems were
tested on 18 ALS patients to: (1) assess performance when they spelled 42
characters online continuously, without a break; and (2) to compare performance
between a matrix-based speller paradigm (MS-P, mean visual angle 6 degree) and
a new speller paradigm that used a larger visual angle called the large visual
angle speller paradigm (LS-P, mean visual angle 8 degree). Results: Although
results showed that there were no significant differences between the two
paradigms in accuracy trend over continuous use (p&gt;0.05), the fatigue during
the LS-P condition was significantly lower than that of MS-P (p&lt;0.05). Results
also showed that continuous use slightly reduced the performance of this
ERP-based BCI. Conclusion: 15 subjects obtained higher than 80% feedback
accuracy (online output accuracy) and 9 subjects obtained higher than 90%
feedback accuracy in one of the two paradigms, thus validating the BCI
approaches in this study. Significance: Most ALS subjects in this study could
spell effectively after continuous use of an ERP-based BCI. The new LS-P
display may be easier for subjects to use, resulting in lower fatigue.

 <dc:description>  Increasing technological sophistication and widespread use of smartphones and
wearable devices provide opportunities for innovative and highly personalized
health interventions. A Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) uses
real-time data collection and communication capabilities of modern mobile
devices to deliver interventions in real-time that are adapted to the
in-the-moment needs of the user. The lack of methodological guidance in
constructing data-based JITAIs remains a hurdle in advancing JITAI research
despite the increasing popularity of JITAIs among clinical scientists. In this
article, we make a first attempt to bridge this methodological gap by
formulating the task of tailoring interventions in real-time as a contextual
bandit problem. Interpretability requirements in the domain of mobile health
lead us to formulate the problem differently from existing formulations
intended for web applications such as ad or news article placement. Under the
assumption of linear reward function, we choose the reward function (the
&quot;critic&quot;) parameterization separately from a lower dimensional parameterization
of stochastic policies (the &quot;actor&quot;). We provide an online actor-critic
algorithm that guides the construction and refinement of a JITAI. Asymptotic
properties of the actor-critic algorithm are developed and backed up by
numerical experiments. Additional numerical experiments are conducted to test
the robustness of the algorithm when idealized assumptions used in the analysis
of contextual bandit algorithm are breached.

approach to augment computational capabilities of mobile devices. An important
issue in the MEC paradigm is computation offloading. In this paper, we propose
an integrated framework for computation offloading and interference management
in wireless cellular networks with mobile edge computing. In this integrated
framework, the MEC server makes the offloading decision according to the local
computation overhead estimated by all user equipments (UEs) and the offloading
overhead estimated by the MEC server itself. Then, the MEC server performs the
PRB allocation using graph coloring. The outcomes of the offloading decision
and PRB allocation are then used to allocate the computation resource of the
MEC server to the UEs. Simulation results are presented to show the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme with different system parameters.

 <dc:description>  The Classification of medical images and illustrations in the literature aims
to label a medical image according to the modality it was produced or label an
illustration according to its production attributes. It is an essential and
challenging research hotspot in the area of automated literature review,
retrieval and mining. The significant intra-class variation and inter-class
similarity caused by the diverse imaging modalities and various illustration
types brings a great deal of difficulties to the problem. In this paper, we
propose a synergic deep learning (SDL) model to address this issue.
Specifically, a dual deep convolutional neural network with a synergic signal
system is designed to mutually learn image representation. The synergic signal
is used to verify whether the input image pair belongs to the same category and
to give the corrective feedback if a synergic error exists. Our SDL model can
be trained 'end to end'. In the test phase, the class label of an input can be
predicted by averaging the likelihood probabilities obtained by two
convolutional neural network components. Experimental results on the
ImageCLEF2016 Subfigure Classification Challenge suggest that our proposed SDL
model achieves the state-of-the art performance in this medical image
classification problem and its accuracy is higher than that of the first place
solution on the Challenge leader board so far.

ubiquitous communication; however in this new process of conviviality new
models like the &quot;collaborative thinking&quot; and &quot;InfoSharing&quot; develop; managing
social information under three Human ontological dimensions (h) - Information
(i) - Machine (m), which is the basis of a new physical-cyber ecosystem, where
they coexist and develop new social units called &quot;virtual communities &quot;. This
new communication infrastructure and social management of information given
discovered areas of vulnerability &quot;social perspective of risk&quot;, impacting all
social units through massive impact vector (i); The virtual environment &quot;H + i

information allows us to understand the path of integration &quot;Techno - Social&quot;
and setting a new contribution to cybernetics, within the convergence of
technology with society and the new challenges of coexistence, aimed at a new
holistic and not pragmatic vision, as the human component (h) in the virtual
environment is the precursor of the future and needs to be studied not as an
application, but as the hub of a new society.

 <dc:description>  Education in the digital period in which we live, is reaching challenges
never before seen, preceded by phenomena that involve not only traditional
social units, but also new virtual communities; Innovating is difficult, it is
a challenge, however, we must think of new teaching methods that impact the
current generation of students, who arrive with new needs and expectations. The
construction of knowledge from the subject and the virtual world that surrounds
it, establishes the basis for the development of a new model of teaching, where
the classroom is the particular representation of a new physical-cybernetic
ecosystem composed of the three large dimensions. Which are part of this new
techno-social convergence (human - information - machine); Allowing an
interrelation between the student, information, machine and the teacher; Using
Biocybernetic methods of influence, control and replication, by means of the
massive impact vector (i); In addition, the development of new strategies
assisted by cybernetics and the updating of academic content according to the
new teaching environment. Hence the importance of this study, which leads us to
the need for a new model of transforming academic instruction, which is not
based on a conglomerate of technological tools, but establishes a new
educational and transformative model, based on &quot;Collaborative Thinking&quot; and the
ubiquity of information, thus establishing the relationship between the subject
and object of study, thus allowing us to establish the new Biocybernetic
educational paradigm in the digital period.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  As an important part of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), machine-to-machine
(M2M) communications have attracted great attention. In this paper, we
introduce mobile edge computing (MEC) into virtualized cellular networks with
M2M communications, to decrease the energy consumption and optimize the
computing resource allocation as well as improve computing capability.
Moreover, based on different functions and quality of service (QoS)
requirements, the physical network can be virtualized into several virtual
networks, and then each MTCD selects the corresponding virtual network to
access. Meanwhile, the random access process of MTCDs is formulated as a
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to minimize the system
cost, which consists of both the energy consumption and execution time of
computing tasks. Furthermore, to facilitate the network architecture
integration, software-defined networking (SDN) is introduced to deal with the
diverse protocols and standards in the networks. Extensive simulation results
with different system parameters reveal that the proposed scheme could
significantly improve the system performance compared to the existing schemes.

 <dc:description>  BBR is a new congestion-based congestion control algorithm proposed by
Google. A BBR flow sequentially measures the bottleneck bandwidth and
round-trip delay of the network pipe, and uses the measured results to govern
its sending behavior, maximizing the delivery bandwidth while minimizing the
delay. However, our deployment in geo-distributed cloud servers reveals a
severe RTT fairness problem: a BBR flow with longer RTT dominates a competing
flow with shorter RTT.
  Somewhat surprisingly, our deployment of BBR on the Internet and an in-house
cluster unearthed a consistent bandwidth disparity among competing flows. Long
BBR flows are bound to seize bandwidth from short ones. Intrigued by this
unexpected behavior, we ask, is the phenomenon intrinsic to BBR? how's the
severity? and what's the root cause? To this end, we conduct thorough
measurements and develop a theoretical model on bandwidth dynamics. We find, as
long as the competing flows are of different RTTs, bandwidth disparities will
arise. With an RTT ratio of 10, even flow starvation can happen. We blame it on
BBR's connivance at sending an excessive amount of data when probing bandwidth.
Specifically, the amount of data is in proportion to RTT, making long RTT flows
overwhelming short ones. Based on this observation, we design a derivative of
BBR that achieves guaranteed flow fairness, at the meantime without losing any
merits. We have implemented our proposed solution in Linux kernel and evaluated
it through extensive experiments.

 <dc:title>Robust Lane Tracking with Multi-mode Observation Model and Particle

 <dc:creator>Huang, Jiawei</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Automatic lane tracking involves estimating the underlying signal from a
sequence of noisy signal observations. Many models and methods have been
proposed for lane tracking, and dynamic targets tracking in general. The Kalman
Filter is a widely used method that works well on linear Gaussian models. But
this paper shows that Kalman Filter is not suitable for lane tracking, because
its Gaussian observation model cannot faithfully represent the procured
observations. We propose using a Particle Filter on top of a novel multiple
mode observation model. Experiments show that our method produces superior
performance to a conventional Kalman Filter.

 <dc:description>  Test-based automatic program repair has attracted a lot of attentions in
recent years. Given a program and a test suite containing at least a failed
test, test-based automatic program repair approaches change the program to make
all test pass. A major challenge faced by automatic program repair approaches
is weak test suite. That is, the test suites in practice are often too weak to
guarantee correctness, and many patches that pass all the tests are not
correct. As a result, existing approaches often generate a large number of
incorrect patches.
  To reduce the number of incorrect patches generated, in this paper we propose
a novel approach that heuristically determines the correctness of the generated
patches. The core idea of our approach is to exploit the behavior similarity of
test case executions. The executions of passed tests on original and patched
programs are likely to behave similarly while the executions of failed tests on
original and patched programs are likely to behave differently. Also, if two
tests exhibit similar runtime behavior, the two tests are likely to have the
same test results. Based on these observations, we generate new test inputs to
enhance the test suites and use their behavior similarity to determine patch
correctness.
  Our approach is evaluated on a dataset consisting of 130 patches generated
from existing program repair systems including jGenProg, Nopol, Kali, and ACS.
Our approach successfully prevented 56.3% of the incorrect patches to be
generated, without blocking any correct patches.

 <dc:title>Network Creation Games: Structure vs Anarchy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>&#xc0;lvarez, Carme</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study Nash equilibria and the price of anarchy in the classical model of
Network Creation Games introduced by Fabrikant et al. In this model every agent
(node) buys links at a prefixed price $\alpha&gt;0$ in order to get connected to
the network formed by all the $n$ agents. In this setting, the reformulated
tree conjecture states that for $\alpha &gt; n$, every Nash equilibrium network is
a tree. Since it was shown that the price of anarchy for trees is constant, if
the tree conjecture were true, then the price of anarchy would be constant for
$\alpha &gt;n$. Moreover, Demaine et al. conjectured that the price of anarchy for
this model is constant.
  Up to now the last conjecture has been proven in (i) the \emph{lower range},
for $\alpha = O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ with $\epsilon \geq \frac{1}{\log n}$ and (ii)
in the \emph{upper range}, for $\alpha &gt; 65n$. In contrast, the best upper
bound known for the price of anarchy for the remaining range is
$2^{O(\sqrt{\log n})}$.
  In this paper we give new insights into the structure of the Nash equilibria
for different ranges of $\alpha$ and we enlarge the range for which the price
of anarchy is constant. Regarding the upper range, we prove that every Nash
equilibrium is a tree for $\alpha &gt; 17n$ and that the price of anarchy is
constant even for $\alpha &gt; 9n$. In the lower range, we show that any Nash
equilibrium for $\alpha &lt; n/C$ with $C &gt; 4$, induces an
$\epsilon-$distance-almost-uniform graph.

function can be written as a difference of another rational function, which has
been a fundamental algorithm for rational summation. In 2014, Chen and Singer
generalized Abramov's algorithm to the case of rational functions in two

cases, which completes our recent project on bivariate extensions of Abramov's

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a principled Perceptual Adversarial Networks (PAN)
for image-to-image transformation tasks. Unlike existing application-specific
algorithms, PAN provides a generic framework of learning mapping relationship
between paired images (Fig. 1), such as mapping a rainy image to its de-rained
counterpart, object edges to its photo, semantic labels to a scenes image, etc.
The proposed PAN consists of two feed-forward convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), the image transformation network T and the discriminative network D.
Through combining the generative adversarial loss and the proposed perceptual
adversarial loss, these two networks can be trained alternately to solve
image-to-image transformation tasks. Among them, the hidden layers and output
of the discriminative network D are upgraded to continually and automatically
discover the discrepancy between the transformed image and the corresponding
ground-truth. Simultaneously, the image transformation network T is trained to
minimize the discrepancy explored by the discriminative network D. Through the
adversarial training process, the image transformation network T will
continually narrow the gap between transformed images and ground-truth images.
Experiments evaluated on several image-to-image transformation tasks (e.g.,
image de-raining, image inpainting, etc.) show that the proposed PAN
outperforms many related state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a new channel model we term the q-ary multi-bit
channel (QMBC). This channel models a memory device, where q-ary symbols
(q=2^s) are stored in the form of current/voltage levels. The symbols are read
in a measurement process, which provides a symbol bit in each measurement step,
starting from the most significant bit. An error event occurs when not all the
symbol bits are known. To deal with such error events, we use GF(q) low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes and analyze their decoding performance. We start with
iterative-decoding threshold analysis, and derive optimal edge-label
distributions for maximizing the decoding threshold. We later move to
finite-length iterative-decoding analysis and propose an edge-labeling
algorithm for improved decoding performance. We then provide finite-length
maximum-likelihood decoding analysis for both the standard non-binary random
ensemble and LDPC ensembles. Finally, we demonstrate by simulations that the
proposed edge-labeling algorithm improves finite-length decoding performance by
orders of magnitude.

 <dc:description>  We address the task of Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) for noisy text. We
present WikilinksNED, a large-scale NED dataset of text fragments from the web,
which is significantly noisier and more challenging than existing news-based
datasets. To capture the limited and noisy local context surrounding each
mention, we design a neural model and train it with a novel method for sampling
informative negative examples. We also describe a new way of initializing word
and entity embeddings that significantly improves performance. Our model
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on WikilinksNED
while achieving comparable performance on a smaller newswire dataset.

 <dc:description>  Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) suffers from data sparsity problem in
sequence prediction tasks where training resource is rare. In order to
alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel generative bridging
network (GBN) to train sequence prediction models, which contains a generator
and a bridge. Unlike MLE directly maximizing the likelihood of the ground
truth, the bridge extends the point-wise ground truth to a bridge distribution
(containing inexhaustible examples), and the generator is trained to minimize
their KL-divergence. In order to guide the training of generator with
additional signals, the bridge distribution can be set or trained to possess
specific properties, by using different constraints. More specifically, to
increase output diversity, enhance language smoothness and relieve learning
burden, three different regularization constraints are introduced to construct
bridge distributions. By combining these bridges with a sequence generator,
three independent GBNs are proposed, namely uniform GBN, language-model GBN and
coaching GBN. Experiment conducted on two recognized sequence prediction tasks
(machine translation and abstractive text summarization) shows that our
proposed GBNs can yield significant improvements over strong baseline systems.
Furthermore, by analyzing samples drawn from bridge distributions, expected
influences on the sequence model training are verified.

 <dc:description>  Base inertial parameters constitute a minimal inertial parametrization of
mechanical systems that is of interest, for example, in parameter estimation
and model reduction. Numerical and symbolic methods are available to determine
their expressions. In this paper the problems associated with the numerical
determination of the base inertial parameters expressions in the context of low
mobility mechanisms are analyzed and discussed through and example. To
circumvent these problems two alternatives are proposed: a variable precision
arithmetic implementation of the customary numerical algorithm and the
application of a general symbolic method. Finally, the advantages of both
approaches compared to the numerical one are discussed in the context of the
proposed low mobility example.

 <dc:description>  We develop a class of algorithms, as variants of the stochastically
controlled stochastic gradient (SCSG) methods (Lei and Jordan, 2016), for the
smooth non-convex finite-sum optimization problem. Assuming the smoothness of
each component, the complexity of SCSG to reach a stationary point with
$\mathbb{E} \|\nabla f(x)\|^{2}\le \epsilon$ is $O\left (\min\{\epsilon^{-5/3},
\epsilon^{-1}n^{2/3}\}\right)$, which strictly outperforms the stochastic
gradient descent. Moreover, SCSG is never worse than the state-of-the-art
methods based on variance reduction and it significantly outperforms them when
the target accuracy is low. A similar acceleration is also achieved when the
functions satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Empirical experiments
demonstrate that SCSG outperforms stochastic gradient methods on training
multi-layers neural networks in terms of both training and validation loss.

 <dc:description>  Tens of millions of wearable fitness trackers are shipped yearly to consumers
who routinely collect information about their exercising patterns. Smartphones
push this health-related data to vendors' cloud platforms, enabling users to
analyze summary statistics on-line and adjust their habits. Third-parties
including health insurance providers now offer discounts and financial rewards
in exchange for such private information and evidence of healthy lifestyles.
Given the associated monetary value, the authenticity and correctness of the
activity data collected becomes imperative. In this paper, we provide an
in-depth security analysis of the operation of fitness trackers commercialized
by Fitbit, the wearables market leader. We reveal an intricate security through
obscurity approach implemented by the user activity synchronization protocol
running on the devices we analyze. Although non-trivial to interpret, we
reverse engineer the message semantics, demonstrate how falsified user activity
reports can be injected, and argue that based on our discoveries, such attacks
can be performed at scale to obtain financial gains. We further document a
hardware attack vector that enables circumvention of the end-to-end protocol
encryption present in the latest Fitbit firmware, leading to the spoofing of
valid encrypted fitness data. Finally, we give guidelines for avoiding similar
vulnerabilities in future system designs.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new methodology for the complexity analysis of
higher-order functional programs, which is based on three ingredients: a
powerful type system for size analysis and a sound type inference procedure for
it, a ticking monadic transformation, and constraint solving. Noticeably, the
presented methodology can be fully automated, and is able to analyse a series
of examples which cannot be handled by most competitor methodologies. This is
possible due to the choice of adopting an abstract index language and index
polymorphism at higher ranks. A prototype implementation is available.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sketches and diagrams play an important role in the daily work of software
developers. In this paper, we investigate the use of sketches and diagrams in
software engineering practice. To this end, we used both quantitative and
qualitative methods. We present the results of an exploratory study in three
companies and an online survey with 394 participants. Our participants included
software developers, software architects, project managers, consultants, as
well as researchers. They worked in different countries and on projects from a
wide range of application areas. Most questions in the survey were related to
the last sketch or diagram that the participants had created. Contrary to our
expectations and previous work, the majority of sketches and diagrams contained
at least some UML elements. However, most of them were informal. The most
common purposes for creating sketches and diagrams were designing, explaining,
and understanding, but analyzing requirements was also named often. More than
half of the sketches and diagrams were created on analog media like paper or
whiteboards and have been revised after creation. Most of them were used for
more than a week and were archived. We found that the majority of participants
related their sketches to methods, classes, or packages, but not to source code
artifacts with a lower level of abstraction.

 <dc:title>Efficient Online Timed Pattern Matching by Automata-Based Skipping</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The timed pattern matching problem is an actively studied topic because of
its relevance in monitoring of real-time systems. There one is given a log $w$
and a specification $\mathcal{A}$ (given by a timed word and a timed automaton
in this paper), and one wishes to return the set of intervals for which the log
$w$, when restricted to the interval, satisfies the specification
$\mathcal{A}$. In our previous work we presented an efficient timed pattern
matching algorithm: it adopts a skipping mechanism inspired by the classic
Boyer--Moore (BM) string matching algorithm. In this work we tackle the problem
of online timed pattern matching, towards embedded applications where it is
vital to process a vast amount of incoming data in a timely manner.
Specifically, we start with the Franek-Jennings-Smyth (FJS) string matching
algorithm---a recent variant of the BM algorithm---and extend it to timed
pattern matching. Our experiments indicate the efficiency of our FJS-type
algorithm in online and offline timed pattern matching.

Yes-Net. It realizes the prediction of bounding boxes and class via single
neural network like YOLOv2 and SSD, but owns more efficient and outstanding
features. It combines local information with global information by adding the
RNN architecture as a packed unit in CNN model to form the basic feature
extractor. Independent anchor boxes coming from full-dimension k-means is also
applied in Yes-Net, it brings better average IOU than grid anchor box. In
addition, instead of NMS, Yes-Net uses RNN as a filter to get the final boxes,
which is more efficient. For 416 x 416 input, Yes-Net achieves 79.2% mAP on
VOC2007 test at 39 FPS on an Nvidia Titan X Pascal.

 <dc:description>  We consider a monitoring application where sensors periodically report data
to a common receiver in a time division multiplex fashion. The sensors are
constrained by the limited and unpredictable energy availability provided by
Energy Harvesting (EH), and by the channel impairments. To maximize the quality
of the reported data, the packets transmitted contain newly generated data
blocks together with up to $r - 1$ previously unsuccessfully delivered ones,
where $r$ is a design parameter; such blocks are compressed, concatenated and
encoded with a channel code. The scheme applies lossy compression, such that
the fidelity of the individual blocks is traded with the reliability provided
by the channel code. We show that the proposed strategy outperforms the one in
which retransmissions are not allowed. We also investigate the tradeoff between
the value of $r$, the compression and coding rates, under the constraints of
the energy availability, and, once $r$ has been decided, use a Markov Decision
Process (MDP) to optimize the compression/coding rates. Finally, we implement a
reinforcement learning algorithm, through which devices can learn the optimal
transmission policy without knowing a priori the statistics of the EH process,
and show that it indeed reaches the performance obtained via MDP.

 <dc:description>  In the $k$-dispersion problem, we need to select $k$ nodes of a given graph
so as to maximize the minimum distance between any two chosen nodes. This can
be seen as a generalization of the independent set problem, where the goal is
to select nodes so that the minimum distance is larger than 1. We design an
optimal $O(n)$ time algorithm for the dispersion problem on trees consisting of
$n$ nodes, thus improving the previous $O(n\log n)$ time solution from 1997.
  We also consider the weighted case, where the goal is to choose a set of
nodes of total weight at least $W$. We present an $O(n\log^2n)$ algorithm
improving the previous $O(n\log^4 n)$ solution. Our solution builds on the
search version (where we know the minimum distance $\lambda$ between the chosen
nodes) for which we present tight $\Theta(n\log n)$ upper and lower bounds.

 <dc:title>Stochastic Bandit Models for Delayed Conversions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Online advertising and product recommendation are important domains of
applications for multi-armed bandit methods. In these fields, the reward that
is immediately available is most often only a proxy for the actual outcome of
interest, which we refer to as a conversion. For instance, in web advertising,
clicks can be observed within a few seconds after an ad display but the
corresponding sale --if any-- will take hours, if not days to happen. This
paper proposes and investigates a new stochas-tic multi-armed bandit model in
the framework proposed by Chapelle (2014) --based on empirical studies in the
field of web advertising-- in which each action may trigger a future reward
that will then happen with a stochas-tic delay. We assume that the probability
of conversion associated with each action is unknown while the distribution of
the conversion delay is known, distinguishing between the (idealized) case
where the conversion events may be observed whatever their delay and the more
realistic setting in which late conversions are censored. We provide
performance lower bounds as well as two simple but efficient algorithms based
on the UCB and KLUCB frameworks. The latter algorithm, which is preferable when
conversion rates are low, is based on a Poissonization argument, of independent
interest in other settings where aggregation of Bernoulli observations with
different success probabilities is required.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, by analyzing solutions of certain equations in the finite
field $\mathbb{F}_{5^m}$, three classes of new optimal quinary cyclic codes
with parameters $[5^m-1,5^m-2m-2,4]$ and two theorems are presented. With the
help of the two theorems, perfect nonlinear monomials, almost perfect nonlinear
monomials and a number of other monomials are used to construct more classes of
new optimal quinary cyclic codes with the same parameters.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of inferring network topology from information cascades,
in which the amount of time taken for information to diffuse across an edge in
the network follows an unknown distribution. Unlike previous studies, which
assume knowledge of these distributions, we only require that diffusion along
different edges in the network be independent together with limited moment
information (e.g., the means). We introduce the concept of a separating vertex
set for a graph, which is a set of vertices in which for any two given distinct
vertices of the graph, there exists a vertex whose distance to them are
different. We show that a necessary condition for reconstructing a tree
perfectly using distance information between pairs of vertices is given by the
size of an observed separating vertex set. We then propose an algorithm to
recover the tree structure using infection times, whose differences have means
corresponding to the distance between two vertices. To improve the accuracy of
our algorithm, we propose the concept of redundant vertices, which allows us to
perform averaging to better estimate the distance between two vertices. Though
the theory is developed mainly for tree networks, we demonstrate how the
algorithm can be extended heuristically to general graphs. Simulation results
suggest that our proposed algorithm performs better than some current
state-of-the-art network reconstruction methods.

 <dc:title>A Parameterized Approach to Personalized Variable Length Summarization

 <dc:creator>Kothari, Ravi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a parameterized approach to produce personalized variable length
summaries of soccer matches. Our approach is based on temporally segmenting the
soccer video into 'plays', associating a user-specifiable 'utility' for each
type of play and using 'bin-packing' to select a subset of the plays that add
up to the desired length while maximizing the overall utility (volume in
bin-packing terms). Our approach systematically allows a user to override the
default weights assigned to each type of play with individual preferences and
thus see a highly personalized variable length summarization of soccer matches.
We demonstrate our approach based on the output of an end-to-end pipeline that
we are building to produce such summaries. Though aspects of the overall
end-to-end pipeline are human assisted at present, the results clearly show
that the proposed approach is capable of producing semantically meaningful and
compelling summaries. Besides the obvious use of producing summaries of
superior league matches for news broadcasts, we anticipate our work to promote
greater awareness of the local matches and junior leagues by producing
consumable summaries of them.

 <dc:title>Storage Capacity as an Information-Theoretic Analogue of Vertex Cover</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mazumdar, Arya</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Motivated by applications in distributed storage, the storage capacity of a
graph was recently defined to be the maximum amount of information that can be
stored across the vertices of a graph such that the information at any vertex
can be recovered from the information stored at the neighboring vertices.
Computing the storage capacity is a fundamental problem in network coding and
is related, or equivalent, to some well-studied problems such as index coding
with side information and generalized guessing games. In this paper, we
consider storage capacity as a natural information-theoretic analogue of the
minimum vertex cover of a graph. Indeed, while it was known that storage
capacity is upper bounded by minimum vertex cover, we show that by treating it
as such we can get a $3/2$ approximation for planar graphs, and a $4/3$
approximation for triangle-free planar graphs. Since the storage capacity is
intimately related to the index coding rate, we get a $2$ approximation of
index coding rate for planar graphs and $3/2$ approximation for triangle-free
planar graphs. Previously only a trivial $4$ approximation of the index coding
rate was known for planar graphs. We then develop a general method of &quot;gadget
covering&quot; to upper bound the storage capacity in terms of the average of a set
of vertex covers. This method is intuitive and leads to the exact
characterization of storage capacity for various families of graphs. As an
illustrative example, we use this approach to derive the exact storage capacity
of cycles-with-chords, a family of graphs related to outerplanar graphs.
Finally, we generalize the storage capacity notion to include recovery from
partial failures in distributed storage. We show tight upper and lower bounds
on this partial recovery capacity that scales nicely with the fraction of
failure in a vertex.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: A shorter version of this paper in the proceedings of the IEEE
  International Symposium on Information Theory, 2017 contains an error. The
  approximation factor for index coding rate for planar graphs was wrongly
  claimed to be 1.923. The correct approximation factor of our method is 2, and
  we have corrected Theorem 3 in this version</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  Recommender systems aim to find an accurate and efficient mapping from
historic data of user-preferred items to a new item that is to be liked by a
user. Towards this goal, energy-based sequence generative adversarial nets
(EB-SeqGANs) are adopted for recommendation by learning a generative model for
the time series of user-preferred items. By recasting the energy function as
the feature function, the proposed EB-SeqGANs is interpreted as an instance of
maximum-entropy imitation learning.

 <dc:title>Semantic Web Prefetching Using Semantic Relatedness between Web pages</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Internet as become the way of life in the fast growing digital life.Even with
the increase in the internet speed, higher latency time is still a challenge.
To reduce latency, caching and pre fetching techniques can be used. However,
caching fails for dynamic websites which keeps on changing rapidly. Another
technique is web prefetching, which prefetches the web pages that the user is
likely to request for in the future. Semantic web prefetching makes use of
keywords and descriptive texts like anchor text, titles, text surrounding
anchor text of the present web pages for predicting users future requests.
Semantic information is embedded within the web pages during their designing
for the purpose of reflecting the relationship between the web pages. The
client can fetch this information from the server. However, this technique
involves load on web designers for adding external tags and on server for
providing this information along with the desired page, which is not desirable.
This paper is an effort to find the semantic relation between web pages using
the keywords provided by the user and the anchor texts of the hyperlinks on the
present web page.It provides algorithms for sequential and similar semantic
relations. These algorithms will be implemented on the client side which will
not cause overhead on designers and load on server for semantic information.

 <dc:description>  Future warehouses will be made of modular embedded entities with
communication ability and energy aware operation attached to the traditional
materials handling and warehousing objects. This advancement is mainly to
fulfill the flexibility and scalability needs of the emerging warehouses.
However, it leads to a new layer of complexity during development and
evaluation of such systems due to the multidisciplinarity in logistics,
embedded systems, and wireless communications. Although each discipline
provides theoretical approaches and simulations for these tasks, many issues
are often discovered in a real deployment of the full system. In this paper we
introduce PhyNetLab as a real scale warehouse testbed made of cyber physical
objects (PhyNodes) developed for this type of application. The presented
platform provides a possibility to check the industrial requirement of an
IoT-based warehouse in addition to the typical wireless sensor networks tests.
We describe the hardware and software components of the nodes in addition to
the overall structure of the testbed. Finally, we will demonstrate the
advantages of the testbed by evaluating the performance of the ETSI compliant
radio channel access procedure for an IoT warehouse.

 <dc:description>  The theory of quantifier-free bit-vectors (QF_BV) is of paramount importance
in software verification. The standard approach for satisfiability checking
reduces the bit-vector problem to a Boolean problem, leveraging the powerful
SAT solving techniques and their conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL)
mechanisms. Yet, this bit-level approach loses the structure of the initial
bit-vector problem. We propose a conflict-driven, word-level, combinable
constraints learning for the theory of quantifier-free bit-vectors. This work
paves the way to truly word-level decision procedures for bit-vectors, taking
full advantage of word-level propagations recently designed in CP and SMT
communities.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present two main results. First, by only one conjecture
(Conjecture 2.9) for recognizing a vertex symmetric graph, which is the hardest
task for our problem, we construct an algorithm for finding an isomorphism
between two graphs in polynomial time $ O(n^{3}) $. Second, without that
conjecture, we prove the algorithm to be of quasi-polynomial time $
O(n^{1.5\log n}) $. The conjectures in this paper are correct for all graphs of
size no larger than $ 5 $ and all graphs we have encountered. At least the
conjecture for determining if a graph is vertex symmetric is quite true
intuitively. We are not able to prove them by hand, so we have planned to find
possible counterexamples by a computer. We also introduce new concepts like
collapse pattern and collapse tomography, which play important roles in our
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Quantifier-free nonlinear arithmetic (QF_NRA) appears in many applications of
satisfiability modulo theories solving (SMT). Accordingly, efficient reasoning
for corresponding constraints in SMT theory solvers is highly relevant. We
propose a new incomplete but efficient and terminating method to identify
satisfiable instances. The method is derived from the subtropical method
recently introduced in the context of symbolic computation for computing real
zeros of single very large multivariate polynomials. Our method takes as input
conjunctions of strict polynomial inequalities, which represent more than 40%
of the QF_NRA section of the SMT-LIB library of benchmarks. The method takes an
abstraction of polynomials as exponent vectors over the natural numbers tagged
with the signs of the corresponding coefficients. It then uses, in turn, SMT to
solve linear problems over the reals to heuristically find suitable points that
translate back to satisfying points for the original problem. Systematic
experiments on the SMT-LIB demonstrate that our method is not a sufficiently
strong decision procedure by itself but a valuable heuristic to use within a
portfolio of techniques.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the Scattered Extrinsic Information Transfer (S-EXIT) chart as a
tool for optimizing degree profiles of short length Low-Density Parity-Check
(LDPC) codes under iterative decoding. As degree profile optimization is
typically done in the asymptotic length regime, there is space for further
improvement when considering the finite length behavior. We propose to consider
the average extrinsic information as a random variable, exploiting its specific
distribution properties for guiding code design. We explain, step-by-step, how
to generate an S-EXIT chart for short-length LDPC codes. We show that this
approach achieves gains in terms of bit error rate (BER) of 0.5 dB and 0.6 dB
over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel for codeword lengths of
128 and 180 bits, respectively, at a target BER of $10^{-4}$ when compared to
conventional Extrinsic Information Transfer (EXIT) chart-based optimization.
Also, a performance gain for the Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) for a block
(i.e., codeword) length of 180 bits is shown.

 <dc:description>  ATMs enable the public to perform financial transactions. Banks try to
strategically position their ATMs in order to maximize transactions and
revenue. In this paper, we introduce a model which provides a score to an ATM
location, which serves as an indicator of its relative likelihood of
transactions. In order to efficiently capture the spatially dynamic features,
we utilize two concurrent prediction models: the local model which encodes the
spatial variance by considering highly energetic features in a given location,
and the global model which enforces the dominant trends in the entire data and
serves as a feedback to the local model to prevent overfitting. The major
challenge in learning the model parameters is the lack of an objective
function. The model is trained using a synthetic objective function using the
dominant features returned from the k-means clustering algorithm in the local
model. The results obtained from the energetic features using the models are
encouraging.

 <dc:description>  The complexity of knowledge production on complex systems is well-known, but
there still lacks knowledge framework that would both account for a certain
structure of knowledge production at an epistemological level and be directly
applicable to the study and management of complex systems. We set a basis for
such a framework, by first analyzing in detail a case study of the construction
of a geographical theory of complex territorial systems, through mixed methods,
namely qualitative interview analysis and quantitative citation network
analysis. We can therethrough inductively build a framework that considers
knowledge entreprises as perspectives, with co-evolving components within
complementary knowledge domains. We finally discuss potential applications and
developments.

 <dc:description>  Identifying the factors which influence academic performance is an essential
part of educational research. Previous studies have documented the importance
of personality traits, class attendance, and social network structure. However,
because most of these analyses were based on a single behavioral aspect and/or
small sample sizes, we lack a quantification of the interplay of these factors.
Here, we infer the academic performance among a cohort of almost 1,000 freshmen
based on data collected through smartphones, which the students used as their
primary phone for two years. The availability of multi-channel data from a
single population allows us to directly compare the predictive power of
individual and social characteristics. We find that a student's performance is
best inferred from their social ties. Network indicators out-perform models
based on individual characteristics. We confirm earlier findings indicating
that class attendance is the most important predictor among the individual
characteristics. Finally, our results indicates potential presence of strong
homophily and/or peer effects among university students.

 <dc:description>  Wearable devices are increasingly being used for monitoring health signals
and for fitness purposes with typical uses being calorie tracker, workout
assistant, and step counter. Even though these wearables can measure many
health signals (e.g. heart rate), they are still not perceived as highly
accurate, relative to clinical monitoring devices. In this paper, we
investigate the accuracy of heart monitor as included in two popular wearables
Motorola Moto 360 and the Apple Watch. We analyze the accuracy from a hardware
and a software perspective and show the effects of body motion on the heart
rate monitors based on the use of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals used in
Android wearables. We then do a software reliability study of the Android Wear
OS, on which many wearables are based, using fuzz testing.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning systems are increasingly used to support public sector
decision-making across a variety of sectors. Given concerns around
accountability in these domains, and amidst accusations of intentional or
unintentional bias, there have been increased calls for transparency of these
technologies. Few, however, have considered how logics and practices concerning
transparency have been understood by those involved in the machine learning
systems already being piloted and deployed in public bodies today. This short
paper distils insights about transparency on the ground from interviews with 27
such actors, largely public servants and relevant contractors, across 5 OECD
countries. Considering transparency and opacity in relation to trust and
buy-in, better decision-making, and the avoidance of gaming, it seeks to
provide useful insights for those hoping to develop socio-technical approaches
to transparency that might be useful to practitioners on-the-ground.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the E2E data, a new dataset for training end-to-end,
data-driven natural language generation systems in the restaurant domain, which
is ten times bigger than existing, frequently used datasets in this area. The
E2E dataset poses new challenges: (1) its human reference texts show more
lexical richness and syntactic variation, including discourse phenomena; (2)
generating from this set requires content selection. As such, learning from
this dataset promises more natural, varied and less template-like system
utterances. We also establish a baseline on this dataset, which illustrates
some of the difficulties associated with this data.

 <dc:description>  Class-agnostic object tracking is particularly difficult in cluttered
environments as target specific discriminative models cannot be learned a
priori. Inspired by how the human visual cortex employs spatial attention and
separate &quot;where&quot; and &quot;what&quot; processing pathways to actively suppress irrelevant
visual features, this work develops a hierarchical attentive recurrent model
for single object tracking in videos. The first layer of attention discards the
majority of background by selecting a region containing the object of interest,
while the subsequent layers tune in on visual features particular to the
tracked object. This framework is fully differentiable and can be trained in a
purely data driven fashion by gradient methods. To improve training
convergence, we augment the loss function with terms for a number of auxiliary
tasks relevant for tracking. Evaluation of the proposed model is performed on
two datasets: pedestrian tracking on the KTH activity recognition dataset and
the more difficult KITTI object tracking dataset.

 <dc:description>  Seminar activities never occur randomly or in a vacuum. Carefully planned and
well-organized thematically, they allow both undergraduates and graduates to
explore in (more) detail various subject areas of particular interest to every
individual or group. Discussion and participation characterize this form of
learning, which is often supplemented by in-class presentations of previously
assigned tasks. The preparation of assignments often presupposes a lot of
self-study and research; it is desirable that the student group enrolled in the
same seminar be able to share all points of view, results and conclusions. The
present paper presents an information system designed to manage the assignments
proposed in a seminar and balance students' individual study load. The system
was developed in PHP language with all editable features stored in MySQL
database for the best speed and performance results. With a modular
organization, the system relies on various entities such as Student, Theme,
Keyword, Reference, etc. The implemented procedures are enhanced by a
user-friendly graphic interface (this will be described in another paper). The
system is easy to use; it eliminates appointment dysfunctions, allows students
to have their say in selecting/accepting a task and even to correlate their
decision with the proposed date for presentation.

 <dc:description>  The attention for personalized mental health care is thriving. Research data
specific to the individual, such as time series sensor data or data from
intensive longitudinal studies, is relevant from a research perspective, as
analyses on these data can reveal the heterogeneity among the participants and
provide more precise and individualized results than with group-based methods.
However, using this data for self-management and to help the individual to
improve his or her mental health has proven to be challenging.
  The present work describes a novel approach to automatically generate
personalized advice for the improvement of the well-being of individuals by
using time series data from intensive longitudinal studies: Automated Impulse
Response Analysis (AIRA). AIRA analyzes vector autoregression models of
well-being by generating impulse response functions. These impulse response
functions are used in simulations to determine which variables in the model
have the largest influence on the other variables and thus on the well-being of
the participant. The effects found can be used to support self-management.
  We demonstrate the practical usefulness of AIRA by performing analysis on
longitudinal self-reported data about psychological variables. To evaluate its
effectiveness and efficacy, we ran its algorithms on two data sets ($N=4$ and
$N=5$), and discuss the results. Furthermore, we compare AIRA's output to the
results of a previously published study and show that the results are
comparable. By automating Impulse Response Function Analysis, AIRA fulfills the
need for accurate individualized models of health outcomes at a low resource
cost with the potential for upscaling.

 <dc:description>  Smart doorbells allow home owners to receive alerts when a visitor is at the
door, see who the guest is, and communicate with the visitor from a smart
device. They greatly improve people's life quality and contribute to the
evolution of smart homes. However, the commercial smart doorbells are quite
expensive, usually cost more than 190 US dollars, which is a substantial
impediment on the pervasiveness of smart doorbells. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Dashbell-a budget smart doorbell system for home use. It connects
a WiFi-enabled device, the Amazon Dash Button, to a network and enables the
home owner to answer the bell triggered by the dash button using a smartphone.
The Dashbell system also enables fast fault detection and diagnosis due to its
distributed framework.

 <dc:description>  We took part in the YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge hosted on
Kaggle, and achieved the 10th place within less than one month's time. In this
paper, we present an extensive analysis and solution to the underlying
machine-learning problem based on frame-level data, where major challenges are
identified and corresponding preliminary methods are proposed. It's noteworthy
that, with merely the proposed strategies and uniformly-averaging multi-crop
ensemble was it sufficient for us to reach our ranking. We also report the
methods we believe to be promising but didn't have enough time to train to
convergence. We hope this paper could serve, to some extent, as a review and
guideline of the YouTube-8M multi-label video classification benchmark,
inspiring future attempts and research.

 <dc:description>  Learning relations based on evidence from knowledge bases relies on
processing the available relation instances. Many relations, however, have
clear domain and range, which we hypothesize could help learn a better, more
generalizing, model. We include such information in the RESCAL model in the
form of a regularization factor added to the loss function that takes into
account the types (categories) of the entities that appear as arguments to
relations in the knowledge base. We note increased performance compared to the
baseline model in terms of mean reciprocal rank and hits@N, N = 1, 3, 10.
Furthermore, we discover scenarios that significantly impact the effectiveness
of the type regularizer.

 <dc:description>  We consider the quantum complexity of computing Schatten $p$-norms and
related quantities, and find that the problem of estimating these quantities is
closely related to the one clean qubit model of computation. We show that the
problem of approximating $\text{Tr}\, (|A|^p)$ for a log-local $n$-qubit
Hamiltonian $A$ and $p=\text{poly}(n)$, up to a suitable level of accuracy, is
contained in DQC1; and that approximating this quantity up to a somewhat higher
level of accuracy is DQC1-hard. In some cases the level of accuracy achieved by
the quantum algorithm is substantially better than a natural classical
algorithm for the problem. The same problem can be solved for arbitrary sparse
matrices in BQP. One application of the algorithm is the approximate
computation of the energy of a graph.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a new coherence-based performance guarantee for the
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. A lower bound for the probability
of correctly identifying the support of a sparse signal with additive white
Gaussian noise is derived. Compared to previous work, the new bound takes into
account the signal parameters such as dynamic range, noise variance, and
sparsity. Numerical simulations show significant improvements over previous
work and a closer match to empirically obtained results of the OMP algorithm.

 <dc:description>  While Bayesian methods are extremely popular in statistics and machine
learning, their application to massive datasets is often challenging, when
possible at all. Indeed, the classical MCMC algorithms are prohibitively slow
when both the model dimension and the sample size are large. Variational
Bayesian methods aim at approximating the posterior by a distribution in a
tractable family. Thus, MCMC are replaced by an optimization algorithm which is
orders of magnitude faster. VB methods have been applied in such
computationally demanding applications as including collaborative filtering,
image and video processing, NLP and text processing... However, despite very
nice results in practice, the theoretical properties of these approximations
are usually not known. In this paper, we propose a general approach to prove
the concentration of variational approximations of fractional posteriors. We
apply our theory to two examples: matrix completion, and Gaussian VB.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the problem of generation and load settings in a
synthetic power grid modeling of high-voltage transmission network, considering
both electrical parameters and topology measures. Our previous study indicated
that the relative location of generation and load buses in a realistic grid are
not random but correlated. And an entropy based optimization approach has been
proposed to determine a set of correlated siting for generation and load buses
in a synthetic grid modeling. Using the exponential distribution of individual
generation capacity or load settings in a grid, and the non-trivial correlation
between the generation capacity or load setting and the nodal degree of a
generation or load bus we develop an approach to generate a statistically
correct random set of generation capacities and load settings, and then assign
them to each generation or load bus in a grid.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of optimally investing in nodes of a social network in a
competitive setting, wherein two camps attempt to drive the average opinion of
the population in their favor. Using DeGroot-Friedkin model of opinion
dynamics, we formulate the problem as a zero-sum game with its players being
the two camps. We derive optimal investment strategies for both camps, and show
that a random investment strategy is optimal when the underlying network
follows a popular class of weight distributions. We study a broad framework,
where we consider several settings of the problem, namely, when the influence
of a camp on a node is a concave function of its investment on that node, when
a camp aims at maximizing competitor's investment or deviation from its desired
investment, and when one of the camps has uncertain information about the
values of the model parameters. We also study the problem under common coupled
constraints on the combined investments by the camps and derive optimal
strategies of the two camps, and hence quantify the first-mover advantage. For
a quantitative and illustrative study, we conduct simulations on real-world
datasets and provide results and insights.

 <dc:title>Dominating Induced Matchings in $S_{1,2,4}$-Free Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Brandst&#xe4;dt, Andreas</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite undirected graph without loops and multiple edges.
A subset $M \subseteq E$ of edges is a {\em dominating induced matching} ({\em
d.i.m.}) in $G$ if every edge in $E$ is intersected by exactly one edge of $M$.
In particular, this means that $M$ is an induced matching, and every edge not
in $M$ shares exactly one vertex with an edge in $M$. Clearly, not every graph
has a d.i.m.
  The \emph{Dominating Induced Matching} (\emph{DIM}) problem asks for the
existence of a d.i.m.\ in $G$; this problem is also known as the
\emph{Efficient Edge Domination} problem; it is the {\em Efficient Domination}
problem for line graphs.
  The DIM problem is \NP-complete in general, and even for very restricted
graph classes such as planar bipartite graphs with maximum degree 3. However,
DIM is solvable in polynomial time for claw-free (i.e., $S_{1,1,1}$-free)
graphs, for $S_{1,2,3}$-free graphs as well as for $S_{2,2,2}$-free graphs, in
linear time for $P_7$-free graphs, and in polynomial time for $P_8$-free graphs
($P_k$ is a special case of $S_{i,j,\ell}$). In a paper by Hertz, Lozin, Ries,
Zamaraev and de Werra, it was conjectured that DIM is solvable in polynomial
time for $S_{i,j,k}$-free graphs for every fixed $i,j,k$.
  In this paper, combining two distinct approaches, we solve it in polynomial
time for $S_{1,2,4}$-free graphs which generalizes the $S_{1,2,3}$-free as well
as the $P_7$-free case.

 <dc:description>  High-resolution satellite imagery have been increasingly used on remote
sensing classification problems. One of the main factors is the availability of
this kind of data. Even though, very little effort has been placed on the zebra
crossing classification problem. In this letter, crowdsourcing systems are
exploited in order to enable the automatic acquisition and annotation of a
large-scale satellite imagery database for crosswalks related tasks. Then, this
dataset is used to train deep-learning-based models in order to accurately
classify satellite images that contains or not zebra crossings. A novel dataset
with more than 240,000 images from 3 continents, 9 countries and more than 20
cities was used in the experiments. Experimental results showed that freely
available crowdsourcing data can be used to accurately (97.11%) train robust
models to perform crosswalk classification on a global scale.

 <dc:description>  SCADA protocols for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are vulnerable to
network attacks such as session hijacking. Hence, research focuses on network
anomaly detection based on meta--data (message sizes, timing, command
sequence), or on the state values of the physical process. In this work we
present a class of semantic network-based attacks against SCADA systems that
are undetectable by the above mentioned anomaly detection. After hijacking the
communication channels between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), our attacks cause the HMI to present a
fake view of the industrial process, deceiving the human operator into taking
manual actions. Our most advanced attack also manipulates the messages
generated by the operator's actions, reversing their semantic meaning while
causing the HMI to present a view that is consistent with the attempted human
actions. The attacks are totaly stealthy because the message sizes and timing,
the command sequences, and the data values of the ICS's state all remain
legitimate.
  We implemented and tested several attack scenarios in the test lab of our
local electric company, against a real HMI and real PLCs, separated by a
commercial-grade firewall. We developed a real-time security assessment tool,
that can simultaneously manipulate the communication to multiple PLCs and cause
the HMI to display a coherent system--wide fake view. Our tool is configured
with message-manipulating rules written in an ICS Attack Markup Language (IAML)
we designed, which may be of independent interest. Our semantic attacks all
successfully fooled the operator and brought the system to states of blackout
and possible equipment damage.

 <dc:title>Exposing Non-Atomic Methods of Concurrent Objects</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Multithreaded software is typically built with specialized concurrent objects
like atomic integers, queues, and maps. These objects' methods are designed to
behave according to certain consistency criteria like atomicity, despite being
optimized to avoid blocking and exploit parallelism, e.g., by using atomic
machine instructions like compare and exchange (cmpxchg). Exposing atomicity
violations is important since they generally lead to elusive bugs that are
difficult to identify, reproduce, and ultimately repair.
  In this work we expose atomicity violations in concurrent object
implementations from the most widely-used software development kit: The Java
Development Kit (JDK). We witness atomicity violations via simple test
harnesses containing few concurrent method invocations. While stress testing is
effective at exposing violations given catalytic test harnesses and lightweight
means of falsifying atomicity, divining effectual catalysts can be difficult,
and atomicity checks are generally cumbersome. We overcome these problems by
automating test-harness search, and establishing atomicity via membership in
precomputed sets of acceptable return-value outcomes. Our approach enables
testing millions of executions of each harness each second (per processor
core). This scale is important since atomicity violations are observed in very
few executions (tens to hundreds out of millions) of very few harnesses (one
out of hundreds to thousands). Our implementation is open source and publicly
available.

 <dc:description>  Urban informatics explore data science methods to address different urban
issues intensively based on data. The large variety and quantity of data
available should be explored but this brings important challenges. For
instance, although there are powerful computer vision methods that may be
explored, they may require large annotated datasets. In this work we propose a
novel approach to automatically creating an object recognition system with
minimal manual annotation. The basic idea behind the method is to use large
input datasets using available online cameras on large cities. A off-the-shelf
weak classifier is used to detect an initial set of urban elements of interest
(e.g. cars, pedestrians, bikes, etc.). Such initial dataset undergoes a quality
control procedure and it is subsequently used to fine tune a strong classifier.
Quality control and comparative performance assessment are used as part of the
pipeline. We evaluate the method for detecting cars based on monitoring
cameras. Experimental results using real data show that despite losing
generality, the final detector provides better detection rates tailored to the
selected cameras. The programmed robot gathered 770 video hours from 24 online
city cameras (\~300GB), which has been fed to the proposed system. Our approach
has shown that the method nearly doubled the recall (93\%) with respect to
state-of-the-art methods using off-the-shelf algorithms.

 <dc:title>New Models and Methods for Formation and Analysis of Social Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dhamal, Swapnil</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This doctoral work focuses on three main problems related to social networks:
(1) Orchestrating Network Formation: We consider the problem of orchestrating
formation of a social network having a certain given topology that may be
desirable for the intended usecases. Assuming the social network nodes to be
strategic in forming relationships, we derive conditions under which a given
topology can be uniquely obtained. We also study the efficiency and robustness
of the derived conditions. (2) Multi-phase Influence Maximization: We propose
that information diffusion be carried out in multiple phases rather than in a
single instalment. With the objective of achieving better diffusion, we
discover optimal ways of splitting the available budget among the phases,
determining the time delay between consecutive phases, and also finding the
individuals to be targeted for initiating the diffusion process. (3) Scalable
Preference Aggregation: It is extremely useful to determine a small number of
representatives of a social network such that the individual preferences of
these nodes, when aggregated, reflect the aggregate preference of the entire
network. Using real-world data collected from Facebook with human subjects, we
discover a model that faithfully captures the spread of preferences in a social
network. We hence propose fast and reliable ways of computing a truly
representative aggregate preference of the entire network. In particular, we
develop models and methods for solving the above problems, which primarily deal
with formation and analysis of social networks.

 <dc:description>  We here introduce an extension and natural generalization of both the
\kappa-\mu$\,$shadowed and the classical Beckmann fading models: the
Fluctuating Beckmann (FB) fading model. This new model considers the clustering
of multipath waves on which the line-of-sight (LoS) components randomly
fluctuate, together with the effect of in-phase/quadrature power imbalance in
the LoS and non-LoS components. Thus, it unifies a variety of important fading
distributions as the one-sided Gaussian, Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, Rician,
\kappa-\mu, \eta-\mu, \eta-\kappa, Beckmann, Rician shadowed and the
\kappa-\mu$\,$shadowed distribution. The chief probability functions of the FB
fading model, namely probability density function, cumulative distribution
function and moment generating function are derived. The second-order
statistics such as the level crossing rate and the average fade duration are
also analyzed. These results can be used to derive some performance metrics of
interest of wireless communication systems operating over FB fading channels.

 <dc:description>  A proper semantic representation for encoding side information is key to the
success of zero-shot learning. In this paper, we explore two alternative
semantic representations especially for zero-shot human action recognition:
textual descriptions of human actions and deep features extracted from still
images relevant to human actions. Such side information are accessible on Web
with little cost, which paves a new way in gaining side information for
large-scale zero-shot human action recognition. We investigate different
encoding methods to generate semantic representations for human actions from
such side information. Based on our zero-shot visual recognition method, we
conducted experiments on UCF101 and HMDB51 to evaluate two proposed semantic
representations . The results suggest that our proposed text- and image-based
semantic representations outperform traditional attributes and word vectors
considerably for zero-shot human action recognition. In particular, the
image-based semantic representations yield the favourable performance even
though the representation is extracted from a small number of images per class.

 <dc:description>  Retinal vessel segmentation is an indispensable step for automatic detection
of retinal diseases with fundoscopic images. Though many approaches have been
proposed, existing methods tend to miss fine vessels or allow false positives
at terminal branches. Let alone under-segmentation, over-segmentation is also
problematic when quantitative studies need to measure the precise width of
vessels. In this paper, we present a method that generates the precise map of
retinal vessels using generative adversarial training. Our methods achieve dice
coefficient of 0.829 on DRIVE dataset and 0.834 on STARE dataset which is the
state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.

 <dc:description>  Anti-Kekul\'{e} problem is a concept of chemical graph theory precluding the
Kekul\'{e} structure of molecules. Matching preclusion and conditional matching
preclusion were proposed as measures of robustness in the event of edge failure
in interconnection networks. It is known that matching preclusion problem on
bipartite graphs is NP-complete. In this paper, we mainly prove that
anti-Kekul\'{e} problem on bipartite graphs is NP-complete. As an extension to
(conditional) matching preclusion problem, we propose the concept of
$s$-restricted matching preclusion problem, and prove that such problem on
bipartite graphs is also NP-complete. Finally, we determine that $s$-restricted
matching preclusion number of $Q_n$ ($n\geq3$) is $2n-2$.

 <dc:description>  Geographically locating an IP address is of interest for many purposes. There
are two major ways to obtain the location of an IP address: querying commercial
databases or conducting latency measurements. For structural Internet nodes,
such as routers, commercial databases are limited by low accuracy, while
current measurement-based approaches overwhelm users with setup overhead and
scalability issues. In this work we present our system HLOC, aiming to combine
the ease of database use with the accuracy of latency measurements. We evaluate
HLOC on a comprehensive router data set of 1.4M IPv4 and 183k IPv6 routers.
HLOC first extracts location hints from rDNS names, and then conducts
multi-tier latency measurements. Configuration complexity is minimized by using
publicly available large-scale measurement frameworks such as RIPE Atlas. Using
this measurement, we can confirm or disprove the location hints found in domain
names. We publicly release HLOC's ready-to-use source code, enabling
researchers to easily increase geolocation accuracy with minimum overhead.

 <dc:description>  We present Signal Spatio-Temporal Logic (SSTL), a modal logic that can be
used to specify spatio-temporal properties in linear time and for a discrete
space. The logic is equipped with a Boolean and a quantitative semantics, and
with accompanying monitoring algorithms. As such, it is suitable for real-time
verification of both white box and black box complex systems. It can also be
integrated into stochastic model checking routines. The logic combines the
until temporal modality with two spatial modality, one expressing that
something is true somewhere nearby and the other capturing the notion of being
surrounded by a region with a given property. The monitoring algorithms are
implemented in an open source Java tool. In the paper we present the logic at
work to analyse the formation of patterns in a Turing reaction-diffusion
system.

 <dc:description>  Providing appealing brand names to newly launched products, newly formed
companies or for renaming existing companies is highly important as it can play
a crucial role in deciding its success or failure. In this work, we propose a
computational method to generate appealing brand names based on the description
of such entities. We use quantitative scores for readability, pronounceability,
memorability and uniqueness of the generated names to rank order them. A set of
diverse appealing names is recommended to the user for the brand naming task.
Experimental results show that the names generated by our approach are more
appealing than names which prior approaches and recruited humans could come up.

 <dc:description>  Given a graph $G$ and $k\in{\mathbb N}$, the Dominating Set problem asks for
a subset $D$ of $k$ vertices such that every vertex in $G$ is either in $D$ or
has a neighbor in $D$. It is well known that Dominating Set is ${\sf
W}[2]$-hard when parameterized by $k$. But it admits a linear kernel on graphs
of bounded expansion and a polynomial kernel on $K_{d,d}$-free graphs, for a
fixed constant $d$. In contrast, the closely related Connected Dominating Set
problem (where $G[D]$ is required to be connected) is known not to admit such
kernels unless $\textsf{NP} \subseteq \textsf{coNP/poly}$. We show that even
though the kernelization complexity of Dominating Set and Connected Dominating
Set diverges on sparse graphs this divergence is not as extreme as
kernelization lower bounds suggest. To do so, we study the Connected Dominating
Set problem under the recently introduced framework of lossy kernelization. In
this framework, for $\alpha&gt;1$, an $\alpha$-approximate bikernel (kernel) is a
polynomial-time algorithm that takes as input an instance $(I,k)$ and outputs
an instance $(I',k')$ of a problem (the same problem) such that, for every $c &gt;
1$, a $c$-approximate solution for the new instance can be turned into a
$c\alpha$-approximate solution of the original instance in polynomial time.
Moreover, the size of $(I',k')$ is bounded by a function of $k$ and $\alpha$.
We show that Connected Dominating Set admits an $\alpha$-approximate bikernel
on graphs of bounded expansion and an $\alpha$-approximate kernel on
$K_{d,d}$-free graphs, for every $\alpha&gt;1$. For $K_{d,d}$-free graphs we
obtain instances of size $k^{\mathcal{O}(d^2 / (\alpha-1))}$ while for bounded
expansion graphs we obtain instances of size $\mathcal{O}(f(\alpha) k)$ (i.e,
linear in $k$), where $f(\alpha)$ is a computable function depending only on
$\alpha$.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a collection of path planning algorithms for real-time
movement of multiple robots across a Robotic Mobile Fulfillment System (RMFS).
Robots are assigned to move storage units to pickers at working stations
instead of requiring pickers to go to the storage area. Path planning
algorithms aim to find paths for the robots to fulfill the requests without
collisions or deadlocks. The state-of-the-art path planning algorithms,
including WHCA*, FAR, BCP, OD&amp;ID and CBS, were adapted to suit path planning in
RMFS and integrated within a simulation tool to guide the robots from their
starting points to their destinations during the storage and retrieval
processes. Ten different layouts with a variety of numbers of robots, floors,
pods, stations and the sizes of storage areas were considered in the simulation
study. Performance metrics of throughput, path length and search time were
monitored. Simulation results demonstrate the best algorithm based on each
performance metric.

 <dc:description>  Robotic motion-planning problems, such as a UAV flying fast in a
partially-known environment or a robot arm moving around cluttered objects,
require finding collision-free paths quickly. Typically, this is solved by
constructing a graph, where vertices represent robot configurations and edges
represent potentially valid movements of the robot between these
configurations. The main computational bottlenecks are expensive edge
evaluations to check for collisions. State of the art planning methods do not
reason about the optimal sequence of edges to evaluate in order to find a
collision free path quickly. In this paper, we do so by drawing a novel
equivalence between motion planning and the Bayesian active learning paradigm
of decision region determination (DRD). Unfortunately, a straight application
of existing methods requires computation exponential in the number of edges in
a graph. We present BISECT, an efficient and near-optimal algorithm to solve
the DRD problem when edges are independent Bernoulli random variables. By
leveraging this property, we are able to significantly reduce computational
complexity from exponential to linear in the number of edges. We show that
BISECT outperforms several state of the art algorithms on a spectrum of
planning problems for mobile robots, manipulators, and real flight data
collected from a full scale helicopter.

 <dc:title>New Results On Routing Via Matchings On Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we present some new complexity results on the routing time of a
graph under the \textit{routing via matching} model. This is a parallel routing
model which was introduced by Alon et al\cite{alon1994routing}. The model can
be viewed as a communication scheme on a distributed network. The nodes in the
network can communicate via matchings (a step), where a node exchanges data
(pebbles) with its matched partner. Let $G$ be a connected graph with vertices
labeled from $\{1,...,n\}$ and the destination vertices of the pebbles are
given by a permutation $\pi$. The problem is to find a minimum step routing
scheme for the input permutation $\pi$. This is denoted as the routing time
$rt(G,\pi)$ of $G$ given $\pi$. In this paper we characterize the complexity of
some known problems under the routing via matching model and discuss their
relationship to graph connectivity and clique number. We also introduce some
new problems in this domain, which may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  By a tight tour in a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ we mean any sequence of its
vertices $(w_0,w_1,\ldots,w_{s-1})$ such that for all $i=0,\ldots,s-1$ the set
$e_i=\{w_i,w_{i+1}\ldots,w_{i+k-1}\}$ is an edge of $H$ (where operations on
indices are computed modulo $s$) and the sets $e_i$ for $i=0,\ldots,s-1$ are
pairwise different. A tight tour in $H$ is a tight Euler tour if it contains
all edges of $H$. We prove that the problem of deciding if a given $3$-uniform
hypergraph has a tight Euler tour is NP-complete, and that it cannot be solved
in time $2^{o(m)}$ (where $m$ is the number of edges in the input hypergraph),
unless the ETH fails. We also present an exact exponential algorithm for the
problem, whose time complexity matches this lower bound, and the space
complexity is polynomial. In fact, this algorithm solves a more general problem
of computing the number of tight Euler tours in a given uniform hypergraph.

 <dc:title>Differential Testing for Variational Analyses: Experience from

 <dc:creator>K&#xe4;stner, Christian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Differential testing to solve the oracle problem has been applied in many
scenarios where multiple supposedly equivalent implementations exist, such as
multiple implementations of a C compiler. If the multiple systems disagree on
the output for a given test input, we have likely discovered a bug without
every having to specify what the expected output is. Research on variational
analyses (or variability-aware or family-based analyses) can benefit from
similar ideas. The goal of most variational analyses is to perform an analysis,
such as type checking or model checking, over a large number of configurations
much faster than an existing traditional analysis could by analyzing each
configuration separately. Variational analyses are very suitable for
differential testing, since the existence nonvariational analysis can provide
the oracle for test cases that would otherwise be tedious or difficult to
write. In this experience paper, I report how differential testing has helped
in developing KConfigReader, a tool for translating the Linux kernel's kconfig
model into a propositional formula. Differential testing allows us to quickly
build a large test base and incorporate external tests that avoided many
regressions during development and made KConfigReader likely the most precise
kconfig extraction tool available.

 <dc:description>  In the problem of high-dimensional convexity testing, there is an unknown set
$S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ which is promised to be either convex or
$\varepsilon$-far from every convex body with respect to the standard
multivariate normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)^n$. The job of a testing
algorithm is then to distinguish between these two cases while making as few
inspections of the set $S$ as possible.
  In this work we consider sample-based testing algorithms, in which the
testing algorithm only has access to labeled samples
$(\boldsymbol{x},S(\boldsymbol{x}))$ where each $\boldsymbol{x}$ is
independently drawn from $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)^n$. We give nearly matching sample
complexity upper and lower bounds for both one-sided and two-sided convexity
testing algorithms in this framework. For constant $\varepsilon$, our results
show that the sample complexity of one-sided convexity testing is
$2^{\tilde{\Theta}(n)}$ samples, while for two-sided convexity testing it is
$2^{\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{n})}$.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We tackle the task of semi-supervised video object segmentation, i.e.
segmenting the pixels belonging to an object in the video using the ground
truth pixel mask for the first frame. We build on the recently introduced
one-shot video object segmentation (OSVOS) approach which uses a pretrained
network and fine-tunes it on the first frame. While achieving impressive
performance, at test time OSVOS uses the fine-tuned network in unchanged form
and is not able to adapt to large changes in object appearance. To overcome
this limitation, we propose Online Adaptive Video Object Segmentation (OnAVOS)
which updates the network online using training examples selected based on the
confidence of the network and the spatial configuration. Additionally, we add a
pretraining step based on objectness, which is learned on PASCAL. Our
experiments show that both extensions are highly effective and improve the
state of the art on DAVIS to an intersection-over-union score of 85.7%.

 <dc:description>  Machine Learning (ML) has been successfully applied to a wide range of
domains and applications. One of the techniques behind most of these successful
applications is Ensemble Learning (EL), the field of ML that gave birth to
methods such as Random Forests or Boosting. The complexity of applying these
techniques together with the market scarcity on ML experts, has created the
need for systems that enable a fast and easy drop-in replacement for ML
libraries. Automated machine learning (autoML) is the field of ML that attempts
to answers these needs. Typically, these systems rely on optimization
techniques such as bayesian optimization to lead the search for the best model.
Our approach differs from these systems by making use of the most recent
advances on metalearning and a learning to rank approach to learn from
metadata. We propose autoBagging, an autoML system that automatically ranks 63
bagging workflows by exploiting past performance and dataset characterization.
Results on 140 classification datasets from the OpenML platform show that
autoBagging can yield better performance than the Average Rank method and
achieve results that are not statistically different from an ideal model that
systematically selects the best workflow for each dataset. For the purpose of
reproducibility and generalizability, autoBagging is publicly available as an R
package on CRAN.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the exploitation of polarimetric diversity in passive multistatic
radar for detecting moving targets. We first derive a data model that takes
into account polarization and anisotropy of targets inherent in multistatic
configurations. Unlike conventional isotropic models in which targets are
modeled as a collection of uniform spheres, we model targets as a collection of
dipole antennas with unknown directions. We consider a multistatic
configuration in which each receiver is equipped with a pair of orthogonally
polarized antennas, one directed to a scene of interest collecting target-path
signal and another one having a direct line-of-sight to a
transmitter-of-opportunity collecting direct-path signal. We formulate the
detection of moving target problem in a generalized likelihood ratio test
framework under the assumption that direct-path signal is available. We show
that the result can be reduced to the case in which the direct-path signal is
absent. We present a method for estimating the dipole moments of targets.
Extensive numerical simulations show the performance of both the detection and
the dipole estimation tasks with and without polarimetric diversity.

 <dc:description>  A vibrant theoretical research area are efficient exact parameterized
algorithms. Very recent solving competitions such as the PACE challenge show
that there is also increasing practical interest in the parameterized
algorithms community. An important research question is whether dedicated
parameterized exact algorithms exhibit certain practical relevance and one can
even beat well-established problem solvers. We consider the logic-based
declarative modeling language and problem solving framework Answer Set
Programming (ASP). State-of-the-art ASP solvers rely considerably on Sat-based
algorithms. An ASP solver (DynASP2), which is based on a classical dynamic
programming on tree decompositions, has been published very recently.
Unfortunately, DynASP2 can outperform modern ASP solvers on programs of small
treewidth only if the question of interest is to count the number of solutions.
In this paper, we describe underlying concepts of our new implementation
(DynASP2.5) that shows competitive behavior to state-of-the-art ASP solvers
even for finding just one solution when solving problems as the Steiner tree
problem that have been modeled in ASP on graphs with low treewidth. Our
implementation is based on a novel approach that we call multi-pass dynamic
programming (M-DPSINC).

 <dc:description>  Improving the health of the nation's population and increasing the
capabilities of the US healthcare system to support diagnosis, treatment, and
prevention of disease is a critical national and societal priority. In the past
decade, tremendous advances in expanding computing capabilities--sensors, data
analytics, networks, advanced imaging, and cyber-physical systems--have, and
will continue to, enhance healthcare and health research, with resulting
improvements in health and wellness. However, the cost and complexity of
healthcare continues to rise alongside the impact of poor health on
productivity and quality of life. What is lacking are transformative
capabilities that address significant health and healthcare trends: the growing
demands and costs of chronic disease, the greater responsibility placed on
patients and informal caregivers, and the increasing complexity of health
challenges in the US, including mental health, that are deeply rooted in a
person's social and environmental context.

 <dc:title>Exponential lower bounds for history-based simplex pivot rules on
  abstract cubes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Thomas, Antonis</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The behavior of the simplex algorithm is a widely studied subject.
Specifically, the question of the existence of a polynomial pivot rule for the
simplex algorithm is of major importance. Here, we give exponential lower
bounds for three history-based pivot rules. Those rules decide their next step
based on memory of the past steps. In particular, we study Zadeh's least
entered rule, Johnson's least-recently basic rule and Cunningham's
least-recently considered (or round-robin) rule. We give exponential lower
bounds on Acyclic Unique Sink Orientations (AUSO) of the abstract cube, for all
of these pivot rules. For Johnson's rule our bound is the first superpolynomial
one in any context; for Zadeh's it is the first one for AUSO. Those two are our
main results.

 <dc:creator>Marzen, Sarah</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recurrent networks are trained to memorize their input better, often in the
hopes that such training will increase the ability of the network to predict.
We show that networks designed to memorize input can be arbitrarily bad at
prediction. We also find, for several types of inputs, that one-node networks
optimized for prediction are nearly at upper bounds on predictive capacity
given by Wiener filters, and are roughly equivalent in performance to randomly
generated five-node networks. Our results suggest that maximizing memory
capacity leads to very different networks than maximizing predictive capacity,
and that optimizing recurrent weights can decrease reservoir size by half an
order of magnitude.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel multitaper modified group delay function-based
representation for speech signals is proposed. With a set of phoneme-based
experiments, it is shown that the proposed method performs better that an
existing multitaper magnitude (MT-MAG) estimation technique, in terms of
variance and MSE, both in spectral- and cepstral-domains. In particular, the
performance of MT-MOGDF is found to be the best with the Thomson tapers.
Additionally, the utility of the MT-MOGDF technique is highlighted in a speaker
recognition experimental setup, where an improvement of around $20\%$ compared
to the next-best technique is obtained. Moreover, the computational
requirements of the proposed technique is comparable to that of MT-MAG. The
proposed feature can be used in for many speech-related applications; in
particular, it is best suited among those that require information of speaker
and speech.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A novel low-complexity wireless neighbor discovery scheme, referred to as
sparse orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (sparse-OFDM) is proposed.
One area of application is the &quot;Internet of Things&quot; (IoT). The number of
devices is very large while every device accesses the network with a small
probability, so the number of active devices in a frame is much smaller than
the total local device population. Sparse OFDM is a one-shot transmission
scheme with low complexity, which exploits both the parallel channel access
offered by OFDM and the bursty nature of transmissions. When the transmission
delay of each device is an integer number of symbol intervals, analysis and
simulation show that sparse OFDM enables successful asynchronous neighbor
discovery using a much smaller code length than random access schemes.

 <dc:description>  We introduce some classical complexity-theoretic techniques to Parameterized
Complexity. First, we study relativization for the machine models that were
used by Chen, Flum, and Grohe (2005) to characterize a number of parameterized
complexity classes. Here we obtain a new and non-trivial characterization of
the A-Hierarchy in terms of oracle machines, and parameterize a famous result
of Baker, Gill, and Solovay (1975), by proving that, relative to specific
oracles, FPT and A[1] can either coincide or differ (a similar statement holds
for FPT and W[P]). Second, we initiate the study of interactive proof systems
in the parameterized setting, and show that every problem in the class AW[SAT]
has a proof system with &quot;short&quot; interactions, in the sense that the number of
rounds is upper-bounded in terms of the parameter value alone.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study Reiter's propositional default logic when the
treewidth of a certain graph representation (semi-primal graph) of the input
theory is bounded. We establish a dynamic programming algorithm on tree
decompositions that decides whether a theory has a consistent stable extension
(Ext). Our algorithm can even be used to enumerate all generating defaults
(ExtEnum) that lead to stable extensions.
  We show that our algorithm decides Ext in linear time in the input theory and
triple exponential time in the treewidth (so-called fixed-parameter linear
algorithm).
  Further, our algorithm solves ExtEnum with a pre-computation step that is
linear in the input theory and triple exponential in the treewidth followed by
a linear delay to output solutions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the missing sample recovery problem using methods
based on sparse approximation. In this regard, we investigate the algorithms
used for solving the inverse problem associated with the restoration of missed
samples of image signal. This problem is also known as inpainting in the
context of image processing and for this purpose, we suggest an iterative
sparse recovery algorithm based on constrained $l_1$-norm minimization with a
new fidelity metric. The proposed metric called Convex SIMilarity (CSIM) index,
is a simplified version of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, which is
convex and error-sensitive. The optimization problem incorporating this
criterion, is then solved via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM). Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method for
missing sample recovery of 1D patch vectors and inpainting of 2D image signals.

 <dc:description>  This paper documents the methodology used to digitally map early modern
quiring patterns through the analysis of a corpus of bibliographic metadata
about hand press books from the period 1471-1861. It describes the application
of an algorithm that registers the presence of a certain quiring and the
ensuing results, mainly relating quiring to chronological (century) and
bibliographic factors (format). In conclusion, the interpretation and future
analysis of these results for the study of book history is discussed.

 <dc:description>  We describe an innovative framework for prescription of personalised health
apps by integrating Personal Health Records (PHR) with disease-specific mobile
applications for managing medical conditions and the communication with
clinical professionals. The prescribed apps record multiple variables including
medical history enriched with innovative features such as integration with
medical monitoring devices and wellbeing trackers to provide patients and
clinicians with a personalised support on disease management. Our framework is
based on an existing PHR ecosystem called TreC, uniquely positioned between
healthcare provider and the patients, which is being used by over 70.000
patients in Trentino region in Northern Italy. We also describe three important
aspects of health app prescription and how medical information is automatically
encoded through the TreC framework and is prescribed as a personalised app,
ready to be installed in the patients' smartphone.

 <dc:description>  Clinical observations indicate that during critical care at the hospitals,
patients sleep positioning and motion affect recovery. Unfortunately, there is
no formal medical protocol to record, quantify, and analyze patient motion.
There is a small number of clinical studies, which use manual analysis of sleep
poses and motion recordings to support medical benefits of patient positioning
and motion monitoring. Manual processes are not scalable, are prone to human
errors, and strain an already taxed healthcare workforce. This study introduces
DECU (Deep Eye-CU): an autonomous mulitmodal multiview system, which addresses
these issues by autonomously monitoring healthcare environments and enabling
the recording and analysis of patient sleep poses and motion. DECU uses three
RGB-D cameras to monitor patient motion in a medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
The algorithms in DECU estimate pose direction at different temporal
resolutions and use keyframes to efficiently represent pose transition
dynamics. DECU combines deep features computed from the data with a modified
version of Hidden Markov Model to more flexibly model sleep pose duration,
analyze pose patterns, and summarize patient motion. Extensive experimental
results are presented. The performance of DECU is evaluated in ideal (BC:
Bright and Clear/occlusion-free) and natural (DO: Dark and Occluded) scenarios
at two motion resolutions in a mock-up and a real ICU. The results indicate
that deep features allow DECU to match the classification performance of
engineered features in BC scenes and increase the accuracy by up to 8% in DO
scenes. In addition, the overall pose history summarization tracing accuracy
shows an average detection rate of 85% in BC and of 76% in DO scenes. The
proposed keyframe estimation algorithm allows DECU to reach an average 78%
transition classification accuracy.

 <dc:description>  We argue that there are currently two major bottlenecks to the commercial use
of statistical machine learning approaches for natural language generation
(NLG): (a) The lack of reliable automatic evaluation metrics for NLG, and (b)
The scarcity of high quality in-domain corpora. We address the first problem by
thoroughly analysing current evaluation metrics and motivating the need for a
new, more reliable metric. The second problem is addressed by presenting a
novel framework for developing and evaluating a high quality corpus for NLG
training.

 <dc:title>Approximate Quantum Error Correction Revisited: Introducing the
  Alpha-bit</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hayden, Patrick</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We establish that, in an appropriate limit, qubits of communication should be
regarded as composite resources, decomposing cleanly into independent
correlation and transmission components. Because qubits of communication can
establish ebits of entanglement, qubits are more powerful resources than ebits.
We identify a new communications resource, the zero-bit, which is precisely
half the gap between them, replacing classical bits by zero-bits makes
teleportation asymptotically reversible. The decomposition of a qubit into an
ebit and two zero-bits has wide-ranging consequences including applications to
state merging, the quantum channel capacity, entanglement distillation, quantum
identification and remote state preparation. The source of these results is the
theory of approximate quantum error correction. The action of a quantum channel
is reversible if and only if no information is leaked to the environment, a
characterization that is useful even in approximate form. However, different
notions of approximation lead to qualitatively different forms of quantum error
correction in the limit of large dimension. We study the effect of a constraint
on the dimension of the reference system when considering information leakage.
While the resulting condition fails to ensure that the entire input can be
corrected, it does ensure that all subspaces of dimension matching that of the
reference are correctable. The size of the reference can be characterized by a
parameter $\alpha$, we call the associated resource an $\alpha$-bit. Changing
$\alpha$ interpolates between standard quantum error correction and quantum
identification, a form of equality testing for quantum states. We develop the
theory of $\alpha$-bits, including the applications above, and determine the
$\alpha$-bit capacity of general quantum channels, finding single-letter
formulas for the entanglement-assisted and amortised variants.

that Bernstein et al. (2000), developed in the context of manifold learning,

We do the same with curvature-constrained shortest paths and their distances,
establishing what we believe are the first approximation bounds for them.

 <dc:title>You Are How You Walk: Uncooperative MoCap Gait Identification for Video

 <dc:description>  This work offers a design of a video surveillance system based on a soft
biometric -- gait identification from MoCap data. The main focus is on two
substantial issues of the video surveillance scenario: (1) the walkers do not
cooperate in providing learning data to establish their identities and (2) the
data are often noisy or incomplete. We show that only a few examples of human
gait cycles are required to learn a projection of raw MoCap data onto a
low-dimensional sub-space where the identities are well separable. Latent
features learned by Maximum Margin Criterion (MMC) method discriminate better
than any collection of geometric features. The MMC method is also highly robust
to noisy data and works properly even with only a fraction of joints tracked.
The overall workflow of the design is directly applicable for a day-to-day
operation based on the available MoCap technology and algorithms for gait
analysis. In the concept we introduce, a walker's identity is represented by a
cluster of gait data collected at their incidents within the surveillance
system: They are how they walk.

 <dc:description>  This paper concerns the fully automatic direct in vivo measurement of active
and passive dynamic skeletal muscle states using ultrasound imaging. Despite
the long standing medical need (myopathies, neuropathies, pain, injury,
ageing), currently technology (electromyography, dynamometry, shear wave
imaging) provides no general, non-invasive method for online estimation of
skeletal intramuscular states. Ultrasound provides a technology in which static
and dynamic muscle states can be observed non-invasively, yet current
computational image understanding approaches are inadequate. We propose a new
approach in which deep learning methods are used for understanding the content
of ultrasound images of muscle in terms of its measured state. Ultrasound data
synchronized with electromyography of the calf muscles, with measures of joint
torque/angle were recorded from 19 healthy participants (6 female, ages: 30 +-
7.7). A segmentation algorithm previously developed by our group was applied to
extract a region of interest of the medial gastrocnemius. Then a deep
convolutional neural network was trained to predict the measured states (joint
angle/torque, electromyography) directly from the segmented images. Results
revealed for the first time that active and passive muscle states can be
measured directly from standard b-mode ultrasound images, accurately predicting
for a held out test participant changes in the joint angle, electromyography,
and torque with as little error as 0.022{\deg}, 0.0001V, 0.256Nm (root mean
square error) respectively.

 <dc:title>Toward Computation and Memory Efficient Neural Network Acoustic Models
  with Binary Weights and Activations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lu, Liang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Neural network acoustic models have significantly advanced state of the art
speech recognition over the past few years. However, they are usually
computationally expensive due to the large number of matrix-vector
multiplications and nonlinearity operations. Neural network models also require
significant amounts of memory for inference because of the large model size.
For these two reasons, it is challenging to deploy neural network based speech
recognizers on resource-constrained platforms such as embedded devices. This
paper investigates the use of binary weights and activations for computation
and memory efficient neural network acoustic models. Compared to real-valued
weight matrices, binary weights require much fewer bits for storage, thereby
cutting down the memory footprint. Furthermore, with binary weights or
activations, the matrix-vector multiplications are turned into addition and
subtraction operations, which are computationally much faster and more energy
efficient for hardware platforms. In this paper, we study the applications of
binary weights and activations for neural network acoustic modeling, reporting
encouraging results on the WSJ and AMI corpora.

 <dc:title>Towards Practical Differential Privacy for SQL Queries</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Differential privacy promises to enable general data analytics while
protecting individual privacy, but existing differential privacy mechanisms do
not support the wide variety of features and databases used in real-world
SQL-based analytics systems.
  This paper presents the first practical approach for differential privacy of
SQL queries. Using 8.1 million real-world queries, we conduct an empirical
study to determine the requirements for practical differential privacy, and
discuss limitations of previous approaches in light of these requirements. To
meet these requirements we propose elastic sensitivity, a novel method for
approximating the local sensitivity of queries with general equijoins. We prove
that elastic sensitivity is an upper bound on local sensitivity and can
therefore be used to enforce differential privacy using any local
sensitivity-based mechanism.
  We build FLEX, a practical end-to-end system to enforce differential privacy
for SQL queries using elastic sensitivity. We demonstrate that FLEX is
compatible with any existing database, can enforce differential privacy for
real-world SQL queries, and incurs negligible (0.03%) performance overhead.

 <dc:description>  Discovering the underlying structures present in large real world graphs is a
fundamental scientific problem. Recent work at the intersection of formal
language theory and graph theory has found that a Hyperedge Replacement Grammar
(HRG) can be extracted from a tree decomposition of any graph. This HRG can be
used to generate new graphs that share properties that are similar to the
original graph. Because the extracted HRG is directly dependent on the shape
and contents of the of tree decomposition, it is unlikely that informative
graph-processes are actually being captured with the extraction algorithm. To
address this problem, the current work presents a new extraction algorithm
called temporal HRG (tHRG) that learns HRG production rules from a temporal
tree decomposition of the graph. We observe problems with the assumptions that
are made in a temporal HRG model. In experiments on large real world networks,
we show and provide reasoning as to why tHRG does not perform as well as HRG
and other graph generators.

 <dc:description>  Current State-of-the-Art High Throughput Satellite systems provide wide-area
connectivity through multi-beam architectures. However, due to the tremendous
system throughput requirements that next generation Satellite Communications
expect to achieve, traditional 4-colour frequency reuse schemes, i.e., two
frequency bands with two orthogonal polarisations, are not sufficient anymore
and more aggressive solutions as full frequency reuse are gaining momentum.
These approaches require advanced interference management techniques to cope
with the significantly increased inter-beam interference, like multicast
precoding and Multi User Detection. With respect to the former, several
peculiar challenges arise when designed for SatCom systems. In particular, to
maximise resource usage while minimising delay and latency, multiple users are
multiplexed in the same frame, thus imposing to consider multiple channel
matrices when computing the precoding weights. In this paper, we focus on this
aspect by re-formulating it as a clustering problem. After introducing a novel
mathematical framework, we design a k-means-based clustering algorithm to group
users into simultaneously precoded and served clusters. Two similarity metrics
are used to this aim: the users' Euclidean distance and their channel distance,
i.e., distance in the multidimensional channel vector space. Through extensive
numerical simulations, we substantiate the proposed algorithms and identify the
parameters driving the system performance.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge mobilization and translation describes the process of moving
knowledge from research and development (R&amp;D) labs into environments where it
can be put to use. There is increasing interest in understanding mechanisms for
knowledge mobilization, specifically with respect to academia and industry
collaborations. These mechanisms include funding programs, research centers,
and conferences, among others. In this paper, we focus on one specific
knowledge mobilization mechanism, the CASCON conference, the annual conference
of the IBM Centre for Advanced Studies (CAS). The mandate of CAS when it was
established in 1990 was to foster collaborative work between the IBM Toronto
Lab and university researchers from around the world. The first CAS Conference
(CASCON) was held one year after CAS was formed in 1991. The focus of this
annual conference was, and continues to be, bringing together academic
researchers, industry practitioners, and technology users in a forum for
sharing ideas and showcasing the results of the CAS collaborative work. We
collected data about CASCON for the past 25 years including information about
papers, technology showcase demos, workshops, and keynote presentations. The
resulting dataset, called &quot;CASCONet&quot; is available for analysis and integration
with related datasets. Using CASCONet, we analyzed interactions between R&amp;D
topics and changes in those topics over time. Results of our analysis show how
the domain of knowledge being mobilized through CAS had evolved over time. By
making CASCONet available to others, we hope that the data can be used in
additional ways to understand knowledge mobilization and translation in this
unique context.

 <dc:title>Parameterized Algorithms for Partitioning Graphs into Highly Connected
  Clusters</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bliznets, Ivan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Karpov, Nikolai</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Clustering is a well-known and important problem with numerous applications.
The graph-based model is one of the typical cluster models. In the graph model,
clusters are generally defined as cliques. However, such an approach might be
too restrictive as in some applications, not all objects from the same cluster
must be connected. That is why different types of cliques relaxations often
considered as clusters.
  In our work, we consider a problem of partitioning graph into clusters and a
problem of isolating cluster of a special type whereby cluster we mean highly
connected subgraph. Initially, such clusterization was proposed by Hartuv and
Shamir. And their HCS clustering algorithm was extensively applied in practice.
It was used to cluster cDNA fingerprints, to find complexes in protein-protein
interaction data, to group protein sequences hierarchically into superfamily
and family clusters, to find families of regulatory RNA structures. The HCS
algorithm partitions graph in highly connected subgraphs. However, it is
achieved by deletion of not necessarily the minimum number of edges. In our
work, we try to minimize the number of edge deletions. We consider problems
from the parameterized point of view where the main parameter is a number of
allowed edge deletions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Social media are pervaded by unsubstantiated or untruthful rumors, that
contribute to the alarming phenomenon of misinformation. The widespread
presence of a heterogeneous mass of information sources may affect the
mechanisms behind the formation of public opinion. Such a scenario is a florid
environment for digital wildfires when combined with functional illiteracy,
information overload, and confirmation bias. In this essay, we focus on a
collection of works aiming at providing quantitative evidence about the
cognitive determinants behind misinformation and rumor spreading. We account
for users' behavior with respect to two distinct narratives: a) conspiracy and
b) scientific information sources. In particular, we analyze Facebook data on a
time span of five years in both the Italian and the US context, and measure
users' response to i) information consistent with one's narrative, ii) troll
contents, and iii) dissenting information e.g., debunking attempts. Our
findings suggest that users tend to a) join polarized communities sharing a
common narrative (echo chambers), b) acquire information confirming their
beliefs (confirmation bias) even if containing false claims, and c) ignore
dissenting information.

 <dc:description>  Distracted driving is a worldwide problem leading to an astoundingly
increasing number of accidents and deaths. Existing work is concerned with a
very small set of distractions (mostly, cell phone usage). Also, for the most
part, it uses unreliable ad-hoc methods to detect those distractions. In this
paper, we present the first publicly available dataset for &quot;distracted driver&quot;
posture estimation with more distraction postures than existing alternatives.
In addition, we propose a reliable system that achieves a 95.98% driving
posture classification accuracy. The system consists of a genetically-weighted
ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We show that a weighted
ensemble of classifiers using a genetic algorithm yields in better
classification confidence. We also study the effect of different visual
elements (i.e. hands and face) in distraction detection by means of face and
hand localizations. Finally, we present a thinned version of our ensemble that
could achieve a 94.29% classification accuracy and operate in a real-time
environment.

 <dc:description>  A family of graphs optimized as the topologies for supercomputer
interconnection networks is proposed. The special needs of such network
topologies, minimal diameter and mean path length, are met by special
constructions of the weight vectors in a representation of the symplectic
algebra. Such theoretical design of topologies can conveniently reconstruct the
mesh and hypercubic graphs, widely used as today's network topologies. Our
symplectic algebraic approach helps generate many classes of graphs suitable
for network topologies.

 <dc:description>  While gradient boosting algorithms are the workhorse of modern industrial
machine learning and data science, all current implementations are susceptible
to a non-trivial but damaging form of label leakage. It results in a systematic
bias in pointwise gradient estimates that lead to reduced accuracy. This paper
formally analyzes the issue and presents solutions that produce unbiased
pointwise gradient estimates. Experimental results demonstrate that our
open-source implementation of gradient boosting that incorporates the proposed
algorithm produces state-of-the-art results outperforming popular gradient
boosting implementations.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach for agents to learn representations of a global map
from sensor data, to aid their exploration in new environments. To achieve
this, we embed procedures mimicking that of traditional Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) into the soft attention based addressing of
external memory architectures, in which the external memory acts as an internal
representation of the environment. This structure encourages the evolution of
SLAM-like behaviors inside a completely differentiable deep neural network. We
show that this approach can help reinforcement learning agents to successfully
explore new environments where long-term memory is essential. We validate our
approach in both challenging grid-world environments and preliminary Gazebo
experiments. A video of our experiments can be found at: https://goo.gl/G2Vu5y.

without any calls to a syntactic parser. We then introduce a method that uses

through a multitask objective; no parsing is required at training or test time.
This &quot;syntactic scaffold&quot; offers a cheaper alternative to traditional syntactic

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel and flexible approach to meta-learning for
learning-to-learn from only a few examples. Our framework is motivated by
actor-critic reinforcement learning, but can be applied to both reinforcement
and supervised learning. The key idea is to learn a meta-critic: an
action-value function neural network that learns to criticise any actor trying
to solve any specified task. For supervised learning, this corresponds to the
novel idea of a trainable task-parametrised loss generator. This meta-critic
approach provides a route to knowledge transfer that can flexibly deal with
few-shot and semi-supervised conditions for both reinforcement and supervised
learning. Promising results are shown on both reinforcement and supervised
learning problems.

 <dc:description>  The shifting strategy, introduced by Hochbaum and Maass, and independently by
Baker, is a unified framework for devising polynomial approximation schemes to
NP-Hard problems. This strategy has been used to great success within the
computational geometry community in a plethora of different applications; most
notably covering, packing, and clustering problems. In this paper, we revisit
the shifting strategy in the context of the streaming model and develop a
streaming-friendly shifting strategy. When combined with the shifting coreset
method introduced by Fonseca et al., we obtain streaming algorithms for various
graph properties of unit disc graphs. As a further application, we present
novel approximation algorithms and lower bounds for the unit disc cover (UDC)
problem in the streaming model, for which currently no algorithms are known.

 <dc:description>  Generating realistic artificial preference distributions is an important part
of any simulation analysis of electoral systems. While this has been discussed
in some detail in the context of a single electoral district, many electoral
systems of interest are based on multiple districts. Neither treating
preferences between districts as independent nor ignoring the district
structure yields satisfactory results. We present a model based on an extension
of the classic Eggenberger-P\'olya urn, in which each district is represented
by an urn and there is correlation between urns. We show in detail that this
procedure has a small number of tunable parameters, is computationally
efficient, and produces &quot;realistic-looking&quot; distributions. We intend to use it
in further studies of electoral systems.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in software-defined mobile networks (SDMNs), in-network
caching, and mobile edge computing (MEC) can have great effects on video
services in next generation mobile networks. In this paper, we jointly consider
SDMNs, in-network caching, and MEC to enhance the video service in next
generation mobile networks. With the objective of maximizing the mean
measurement of video quality, an optimization problem is formulated. Due to the
coupling of video data rate, computing resource, and traffic engineering
(bandwidth provisioning and paths selection), the problem becomes intractable
in practice. Thus, we utilize dual-decomposition method to decouple those three
sets of variables. Extensive simulations are conducted with different system
configurations to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  In order to better accommodate the dramatically increasing demand for data
caching and computing services, storage and computation capabilities should be
endowed to some of the intermediate nodes within the network. In this paper, we
design a novel virtualized heterogeneous networks framework aiming at enabling
content caching and computing. With the virtualization of the whole system, the
communication, computing and caching resources can be shared among all users
associated with different virtual service providers. We formulate the virtual
resource allocation strategy as a joint optimization problem, where the gains
of not only virtualization but also caching and computing are taken into
consideration in the proposed architecture. In addition, a distributed
algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers is adopted to
solve the formulated problem, in order to reduce the computational complexity
and signaling overhead. Finally, extensive simulations are presented to show
the effectiveness of the proposed scheme under different system parameters.

 <dc:description>  In the area of full duplex (FD)-enabled small cell networks, limited works
have been done on consideration of cache and mobile edge communication (MEC).
In this paper, a virtual FD-enabled small cell network with cache and MEC is
investigated for two heterogeneous services, high-data-rate service and
computation-sensitive service. In our proposed scheme, content caching and FD
communication are closely combined to offer high-data-rate services without the
cost of backhaul resource. Computing offloading is conducted to guarantee the
delay requirement of users. Then we formulate a virtual resource allocation
problem, in which user association, power control, caching and computing
offloading policies and resource allocation are jointly considered. Since the
original problem is a mixed combinatorial problem, necessary variables
relaxation and reformulation are conducted to transfer the original problem to
a convex problem. Furthermore, alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) algorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal solution. Finally, extensive
simulations are conducted with different system configurations to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  Segmenting foreground object from a video is a challenging task because of
the large deformations of the objects, occlusions, and background clutter. In
this paper, we propose a frame-by-frame but computationally efficient approach
for video object segmentation by clustering visually similar generic object
segments throughout the video. Our algorithm segments various object instances
appearing in the video and then perform clustering in order to group visually
similar segments into one cluster. Since the object that needs to be segmented
appears in most part of the video, we can retrieve the foreground segments from
the cluster having maximum number of segments, thus filtering out noisy
segments that do not represent any object. We then apply a track and fill
approach in order to localize the objects in the frames where the object
segmentation framework fails to segment any object. Our algorithm performs
comparably to the recent automatic methods for video object segmentation when
benchmarked on DAVIS dataset while being computationally much faster.

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework for adversarial training that relies on a sample
rather than a single sample point as the fundamental unit of discrimination.
Inspired by discrepancy measures and two-sample tests between probability
distributions, we propose two such distributional adversaries that operate and
predict on samples, and show how they can be easily implemented on top of
existing models. Various experimental results show that generators trained with
our distributional adversaries are much more stable and are remarkably less
prone to mode collapse than traditional models trained with pointwise
prediction discriminators. The application of our framework to domain
adaptation also results in considerable improvement over recent
state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) can be trained to realize inverse
control of physics-based sound synthesizers. Physics-based sound synthesizers
simulate the laws of physics to produce output sound according to input gesture
signals. When a user's gestures are measured in real time, she or he can use
them to control physics-based sound synthesizers, thereby creating simulated
virtual instruments. An intriguing question is how to program a computer to
learn to play such physics-based models. This work demonstrates that LSTMs can
be trained to accomplish this inverse control task with four physics-based
sound synthesizers.

 <dc:description>  The increasing accuracy of automatic chord estimation systems, the
availability of vast amounts of heterogeneous reference annotations, and
insights from annotator subjectivity research make chord label personalization
increasingly important. Nevertheless, automatic chord estimation systems are
historically exclusively trained and evaluated on a single reference
annotation. We introduce a first approach to automatic chord label
personalization by modeling subjectivity through deep learning of a harmonic
interval-based chord label representation. After integrating these
representations from multiple annotators, we can accurately personalize chord
labels for individual annotators from a single model and the annotators' chord
label vocabulary. Furthermore, we show that chord personalization using
multiple reference annotations outperforms using a single reference annotation.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied on both
discriminative and generative modeling for music-related tasks. For a
particular task, the trained CNN contains information representing the decision
making or the abstracting process. One can hope to manipulate existing music
based on this 'informed' network and create music with new features
corresponding to the knowledge obtained by the network. In this paper, we
propose a method to utilize the stored information from a CNN trained on
musical genre classification task. The network was composed of three
convolutional layers, and was trained to classify five-second song clips into
five different genres. After training, randomly selected clips were modified by
maximizing the sum of outputs from the network layers. In addition to the
potential of such CNNs to produce interesting audio transformation, more
information about the network and the original music could be obtained from the
analysis of the generated features since these features indicate how the
network 'understands' the music.

 <dc:description>  Emotions play a central role in most forms of natural human interaction so we
may expect that computational methods for the processing and expression of
emotions will play a growing role in human-computer interaction. The OCC model
has established itself as the standard model for emotion synthesis. A large
number of studies employed the OCC model to generate emotions for their
embodied characters. Many developers of such characters believe that the OCC
model will be all they ever need to equip their character with emotions. This
study reflects on the limitations of the OCC model specifically, and on the
emotion models in general due to their dependency on artificial intelligence.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel neural network model for music signal processing using
vector product neurons and dimensionality transformations. Here, the inputs are
first mapped from real values into three-dimensional vectors then fed into a
three-dimensional vector product neural network where the inputs, outputs, and
weights are all three-dimensional values. Next, the final outputs are mapped
back to the reals. Two methods for dimensionality transformation are proposed,
one via context windows and the other via spectral coloring. Experimental
results on the iKala dataset for blind singing voice separation confirm the
efficacy of our model.

 <dc:description>  Acoustic events often have a visual counterpart. Knowledge of visual
information can aid the understanding of complex auditory scenes, even when
only a stereo mixdown is available in the audio domain, \eg identifying which
musicians are playing in large musical ensembles. In this paper, we consider a
vision-based approach to note onset detection. As a case study we focus on
challenging, real-world clarinetist videos and carry out preliminary
experiments on a 3D convolutional neural network based on multiple streams and
purposely avoiding temporal pooling. We release an audiovisual dataset with 4.5
hours of clarinetist videos together with cleaned annotations which include
about 36,000 onsets and the coordinates for a number of salient points and
regions of interest. By performing several training trials on our dataset, we
learned that the problem is challenging. We found that the CNN model is highly
sensitive to the optimization algorithm and hyper-parameters, and that treating
the problem as binary classification may prevent the joint optimization of
precision and recall. To encourage further research, we publicly share our
dataset, annotations and all models and detail which issues we came across
during our preliminary experiments.

 <dc:description>  Presented is a method of generating a full drum kit part for a provided
kick-drum sequence. A sequence to sequence neural network model used in natural
language translation was adopted to encode multiple musical styles and an
online survey was developed to test different techniques for sampling the
output of the softmax function. The strongest results were found using a
sampling technique that drew from the three most probable outputs at each
subdivision of the drum pattern but the consistency of output was found to be
heavily dependent on style.

 <dc:description>  One of the decisions that arise when designing a neural network for any
application is how the data should be represented in order to be presented to,
and possibly generated by, a neural network. For audio, the choice is less
obvious than it seems to be for visual images, and a variety of representations
have been used for different applications including the raw digitized sample
stream, hand-crafted features, machine discovered features, MFCCs and variants
that include deltas, and a variety of spectral representations. This paper
reviews some of these representations and issues that arise, focusing
particularly on spectrograms for generating audio using neural networks for
style transfer.

 <dc:description>  While a number of different algorithms have recently been proposed for
convolutional dictionary learning, this remains an expensive problem. The
single biggest impediment to learning from large training sets is the memory
requirements, which grow at least linearly with the size of the training set
since all existing methods are batch algorithms. The work reported here
addresses this limitation by extending online dictionary learning ideas to the
convolutional context.

 <dc:description>  Background. Previous state-of-the-art systems on Drug Name Recognition (DNR)
and Clinical Concept Extraction (CCE) have focused on a combination of text
&quot;feature engineering&quot; and conventional machine learning algorithms such as
conditional random fields and support vector machines. However, developing good
features is inherently heavily time-consuming. Conversely, more modern machine
learning approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have proved
capable of automatically learning effective features from either random
assignments or automated word &quot;embeddings&quot;. Objectives. (i) To create a highly
accurate DNR and CCE system that avoids conventional, time-consuming feature
engineering. (ii) To create richer, more specialized word embeddings by using
health domain datasets such as MIMIC-III. (iii) To evaluate our systems over
three contemporary datasets. Methods. Two deep learning methods, namely the
Bidirectional LSTM and the Bidirectional LSTM-CRF, are evaluated. A CRF model
is set as the baseline to compare the deep learning systems to a traditional
machine learning approach. The same features are used for all the models.
Results. We have obtained the best results with the Bidirectional LSTM-CRF
model, which has outperformed all previously proposed systems. The specialized
embeddings have helped to cover unusual words in DDI-DrugBank and DDI-MedLine,
but not in the 2010 i2b2/VA IRB Revision dataset. Conclusion. We present a
state-of-the-art system for DNR and CCE. Automated word embeddings has allowed
us to avoid costly feature engineering and achieve higher accuracy.
Nevertheless, the embeddings need to be retrained over datasets that are
adequate for the domain, in order to adequately cover the domain-specific
vocabulary.

 <dc:title>Analysis and Modeling of 3D Indoor Scenes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ma, Rui</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We live in a 3D world, performing activities and interacting with objects in
the indoor environments everyday. Indoor scenes are the most familiar and
essential environments in everyone's life. In the virtual world, 3D indoor
scenes are also ubiquitous in 3D games and interior design. With the fast
development of VR/AR devices and the emerging applications, the demand of
realistic 3D indoor scenes keeps growing rapidly. Currently, designing detailed
3D indoor scenes requires proficient 3D designing and modeling skills and is
often time-consuming. For novice users, creating realistic and complex 3D
indoor scenes is even more difficult and challenging.
  Many efforts have been made in different research communities, e.g. computer
graphics, vision and robotics, to capture, analyze and generate the 3D indoor
data. This report mainly focuses on the recent research progress in graphics on
geometry, structure and semantic analysis of 3D indoor data and different
modeling techniques for creating plausible and realistic indoor scenes. We
first review works on understanding and semantic modeling of scenes from
captured 3D data of the real world. Then, we focus on the virtual scenes
composed of 3D CAD models and study methods for 3D scene analysis and
processing. After that, we survey various modeling paradigms for creating 3D
indoor scenes and investigate human-centric scene analysis and modeling, which
bridge indoor scene studies of graphics, vision and robotics. At last, we
discuss open problems in indoor scene processing that might bring interests to
graphics and all related communities.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel method called Rotational Region CNN (R2CNN)
for detecting arbitrary-oriented texts in natural scene images. The framework
is based on Faster R-CNN [1] architecture. First, we use the Region Proposal
Network (RPN) to generate axis-aligned bounding boxes that enclose the texts
with different orientations. Second, for each axis-aligned text box proposed by
RPN, we extract its pooled features with different pooled sizes and the
concatenated features are used to simultaneously predict the text/non-text
score, axis-aligned box and inclined minimum area box. At last, we use an
inclined non-maximum suppression to get the detection results. Our approach
achieves competitive results on text detection benchmarks: ICDAR 2015 and ICDAR
2013.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We address the problem of sparse recovery in an online setting, where random
linear measurements of a sparse signal are revealed sequentially and the
objective is to recover the underlying signal. We propose a reweighted least
squares (RLS) algorithm to solve the problem of online sparse reconstruction,
wherein a system of linear equations is solved using conjugate gradient with
the arrival of every new measurement. The proposed online algorithm is useful
in a setting where one seeks to design a progressive decoding strategy to
reconstruct a sparse signal from linear measurements so that one does not have
to wait until all measurements are acquired. Moreover, the proposed algorithm
is also useful in applications where it is infeasible to process all the
measurements using a batch algorithm, owing to computational and storage
constraints. It is not needed a priori to collect a fixed number of
measurements; rather one can keep collecting measurements until the quality of
reconstruction is satisfactory and stop taking further measurements once the
reconstruction is sufficiently accurate. We provide a proof-of-concept by
comparing the performance of our algorithm with the RLS-based batch
reconstruction strategy, known as iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS),
on natural images. Experiments on a recently proposed focal plane array-based
imaging setup show up to 1 dB improvement in output peak signal-to-noise ratio
as compared with the total variation-based reconstruction.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the problem of audio source separation. To handle the
complex and ill-posed nature of the problems of audio source separation, the
current state-of-the-art approaches employ deep neural networks to obtain
instrumental spectra from a mixture. In this study, we propose a novel network
architecture that extends the recently developed densely connected
convolutional network (DenseNet), which has shown excellent results on image
classification tasks. To deal with the specific problem of audio source
separation, an up-sampling layer, block skip connection and band-dedicated
dense blocks are incorporated on top of DenseNet. The proposed approach takes
advantage of long contextual information and outperforms state-of-the-art
results on SiSEC 2016 competition by a large margin in terms of
signal-to-distortion ratio. Moreover, the proposed architecture requires
significantly fewer parameters and considerably less training time compared
with other methods.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel method for defining geographic districts in road
networks using stable matching. In this approach, each geographic district is
defined in terms of a center, which identifies a location of interest, such as
a post office or polling place, and all other network vertices must be labeled
with the center to which they are associated. We focus on defining geographic
districts that are equitable, in that every district has the same number of
vertices and the assignment is stable in terms of geographic distance. That is,
there is no unassigned vertex-center pair such that both would prefer each
other over their current assignments. We solve this problem using a version of
the classic stable matching problem, called symmetric stable matching, in which
the preferences of the elements in both sets obey a certain symmetry. In our
case, we study a graph-based version of stable matching in which nodes are
stably matched to a subset of nodes denoted as centers, prioritized by their
shortest-path distances, so that each center is apportioned a certain number of
nodes. We show that, for a planar graph or road network with $n$ nodes and $k$
centers, the problem can be solved in $O(n\sqrt{n}\log n)$ time, which improves
upon the $O(nk)$ runtime of using the classic Gale-Shapley stable matching
algorithm when $k$ is large. Finally, we provide experimental results on road
networks for these algorithms and a heuristic algorithm that performs better
than the Gale-Shapley algorithm for any range of values of $k$.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce Path Integral Networks (PI-Net), a recurrent
network representation of the Path Integral optimal control algorithm. The
network includes both system dynamics and cost models, used for optimal control
based planning. PI-Net is fully differentiable, learning both dynamics and cost
models end-to-end by back-propagation and stochastic gradient descent. Because
of this, PI-Net can learn to plan. PI-Net has several advantages: it can
generalize to unseen states thanks to planning, it can be applied to continuous
control tasks, and it allows for a wide variety learning schemes, including
imitation and reinforcement learning. Preliminary experiment results show that
PI-Net, trained by imitation learning, can mimic control demonstrations for two
simulated problems; a linear system and a pendulum swing-up problem. We also
show that PI-Net is able to learn dynamics and cost models latent in the
demonstrations.

 <dc:description>  Generating natural language descriptions of images is an important capability
for a robot or other visual-intelligence driven AI agent that may need to
communicate with human users about what it is seeing. Such image captioning
methods are typically trained by maximising the likelihood of ground-truth
annotated caption given the image. While simple and easy to implement, this
approach does not directly maximise the language quality metrics we care about
such as CIDEr. In this paper we investigate training image captioning methods
based on actor-critic reinforcement learning in order to directly optimise
non-differentiable quality metrics of interest. By formulating a per-token
advantage and value computation strategy in this novel reinforcement learning
based captioning model, we show that it is possible to achieve the state of the
art performance on the widely used MSCOCO benchmark.

 <dc:title>A sharp recovery condition for sparse signals with partial support
  information via orthogonal matching pursuit</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers the exact recovery of $k$-sparse signals in the
noiseless setting and support recovery in the noisy case when some prior
information on the support of the signals is available. This prior support
consists of two parts. One part is a subset of the true support and another
part is outside of the true support. For $k$-sparse signals $\mathbf{x}$ with
the prior support which is composed of $g$ true indices and $b$ wrong indices,
we show that if the restricted isometry constant (RIC) $\delta_{k+b+1}$ of the
sensing matrix $\mathbf{A}$ satisfies \begin{eqnarray*}
\delta_{k+b+1}&lt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{k-g+1}}, \end{eqnarray*} then orthogonal matching
pursuit (OMP) algorithm can perfectly recover the signals $\mathbf{x}$ from
$\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{Ax}$ in $k-g$ iterations. Moreover, we show the above
sufficient condition on the RIC is sharp. In the noisy case, we achieve the
exact recovery of the remainder support (the part of the true support outside
of the prior support) for the $k$-sparse signals $\mathbf{x}$ from
$\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{Ax}+\mathbf{v}$ under appropriate conditions. For the
remainder support recovery, we also obtain a necessary condition based on the
minimum magnitude of partial nonzero elements of the signals $\mathbf{x}$.

 <dc:description>  Given two $k$-independent sets $I$ and $J$ of a graph $G$, one can ask if it
is possible to transform the one into the other in such a way that, at any
step, we replace one vertex of the current independent set by another while
keeping the property of being independent. Deciding this problem, known as the
Token Jumping (TJ) reconfiguration problem, is PSPACE-complete even on planar
graphs. Ito et al. proved in 2014 that the problem is FPT parameterized by $k$
if the input graph is $K_{3,\ell}$-free.
  We prove that the result of Ito et al. can be extended to any
$K_{\ell,\ell}$-free graphs. In other words, if $G$ is a $K_{\ell,\ell}$-free
graph, then it is possible to decide in FPT-time if $I$ can be transformed into
$J$. As a by product, the TJ-reconfiguration problem is FPT in many well-known
classes of graphs such as any minor-free class.

 <dc:title>Recovery of signals by a weighted $\ell_2/\ell_1$ minimization under

 <dc:creator>Chen, Wengu</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ge, Huanmin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a weighted $\ell_2/\ell_1$ minimization to
recover block sparse signals with arbitrary prior support information. When
partial prior support information is available, a sufficient condition based on
the high order block RIP is derived to guarantee stable and robust recovery of
block sparse signals via the weighted $\ell_2/\ell_1$ minimization. We then
show if the accuracy of arbitrary prior block support estimate is at least
$50\%$, the sufficient recovery condition by the weighted $\ell_2/\ell_{1}$
minimization is weaker than that by the $\ell_2/\ell_{1}$ minimization, and the
weighted $\ell_2/\ell_{1}$ minimization provides better upper bounds on the
recovery error in terms of the measurement noise and the compressibility of the
signal. Moreover, we illustrate the advantages of the weighted $\ell_2/\ell_1$
minimization approach in the recovery performance of block sparse signals under
uniform and non-uniform prior information by extensive numerical experiments.
The significance of the results lies in the facts that making explicit use of
block sparsity and partial support information of block sparse signals can
achieve better recovery performance than handling the signals as being in the
conventional sense, thereby ignoring the additional structure and prior support
information in the problem.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present the concept of Simultaneous Lightwave Information and Power
Transfer (SLIPT) for indoor Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.
Specifically, we propose novel and fundamental SLIPT strategies, which can be
implemented through Visible Light or Infrared communication systems, equipped
with a simple solar panel-based receiver. These strategies are performed at the
transmitter or at the receiver, or at both sides, named Adjusting transmission,
Adjusting reception and Coordinated adjustment of transmission and reception,
correspondingly. Furthermore, we deal with the fundamental trade-off between
harvested energy and quality-of-service (QoS), by maximizing the harvested
energy, while achieving the required user's QoS. To this end, two optimization
problems are formulated and optimally solved. Computer simulations validate the
optimum solutions and reveal that the proposed strategies considerably increase
the harvested energy, compared to SLIPT with fixed policies.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we focus our attention on the exploitation of the information
contained in financial news to enhance the performance of a classifier of bank
distress. Such information should be analyzed and inserted into the predictive
model in the most efficient way and this task deals with all the issues related
to text analysis and specifically analysis of news media. Among the different
models proposed for such purpose, we investigate one of the possible deep
learning approaches, based on a doc2vec representation of the textual data, a
kind of neural network able to map the sequential and symbolic text input onto
a reduced latent semantic space. Afterwards, a second supervised neural network
is trained combining news data with standard financial figures to classify
banks whether in distressed or tranquil states, based on a small set of known
distress events. Then the final aim is not only the improvement of the
predictive performance of the classifier but also to assess the importance of
news data in the classification process. Does news data really bring more
useful information not contained in standard financial variables? Our results
seem to confirm such hypothesis.

 <dc:title>Considerations about Continuous Experimentation for Resource-Constrained

 <dc:description>  Autonomous vehicles are slowly becoming reality thanks to the efforts of many
academic and industrial organizations. Due to the complexity of the software
powering these systems and the dynamicity of the development processes, an
architectural solution capable of supporting long-term evolution and
maintenance is required.
  Continuous Experimentation (CE) is an already increasingly adopted practice
in software-intensive web-based software systems to steadily improve them over
time. CE allows organizations to steer the development efforts by basing
decisions on data collected about the system in its field of application.
Despite the advantages of Continuous Experimentation, this practice is only
rarely adopted in cyber-physical systems and in the automotive domain. Reasons
for this include the strict safety constraints and the computational
capabilities needed from the target systems.
  In this work, a concept for using Continuous Experimentation for
resource-constrained platforms like a self-driving vehicle is outlined.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show impressive performance for image
classification and detection, extending heavily to the medical image domain.
Nevertheless, medical experts are sceptical in these predictions as the
nonlinear multilayer structure resulting in a classification outcome is not
directly graspable. Recently, approaches have been shown which help the user to
understand the discriminative regions within an image which are decisive for
the CNN to conclude to a certain class. Although these approaches could help to
build trust in the CNNs predictions, they are only slightly shown to work with
medical image data which often poses a challenge as the decision for a class
relies on different lesion areas scattered around the entire image. Using the
DiaretDB1 dataset, we show that on retina images different lesion areas
fundamental for diabetic retinopathy are detected on an image level with high
accuracy, comparable or exceeding supervised methods. On lesion level, we
achieve few false positives with high sensitivity, though, the network is
solely trained on image-level labels which do not include information about
existing lesions. Classifying between diseased and healthy images, we achieve
an AUC of 0.954 on the DiaretDB1.

 <dc:description>  In electrical distribution grids, the constantly increasing number of power
generation devices based on renewables demands a transition from a centralized
to a distributed generation paradigm. In fact, power injection from Distributed
Energy Resources (DERs) can be selectively controlled to achieve other
objectives beyond supporting loads, such as the minimization of the power
losses along the distribution lines and the subsequent increase of the grid
hosting capacity. However, these technical achievements are only possible if
alongside electrical optimization schemes, a suitable market model is set up to
promote cooperation from the end users. In contrast with the existing
literature, where energy trading and electrical optimization of the grid are
often treated separately or the trading strategy is tailored to a specific
electrical optimization objective, in this work we consider their joint
optimization. Specifically, we present a multi-objective optimization problem
accounting for energy trading, where: 1) DERs try to maximize their profit,
resulting from selling their surplus energy, 2) the loads try to minimize their
expense, and 3) the main power supplier aims at maximizing the electrical grid
efficiency through a suitable discount policy. This optimization problem is
proved to be non convex, and an equivalent convex formulation is derived.
Centralized solutions are discussed first, and are subsequently distributed.
Numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the so obtained optimal
policies are then presented.

 <dc:title>Machine Learning Approaches to Energy Consumption Forecasting in

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of power demand forecasting in residential
micro-grids. Several approaches using ARMA models, support vector machines, and
recurrent neural networks that perform one-step ahead predictions have been
proposed in the literature. Here, we extend them to perform multi-step ahead
forecasting and we compare their performance. Toward this end, we implement a
parallel and efficient training framework, using power demand traces from real
deployments to gauge the accuracy of the considered techniques. Our results
indicate that machine learning schemes achieve smaller prediction errors in the
mean and the variance with respect to ARMA, but there is no clear algorithm of
choice among them. Pros and cons of these approaches are discussed and the
solution of choice is found to depend on the specific use case requirements. A
hybrid approach, that is driven by the prediction interval, the target error,
and its uncertainty, is then recommended.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a co-salient object detection method to find common
salient regions in a set of images. We utilize deep saliency networks to
transfer co-saliency prior knowledge and better capture high-level semantic
information, and the resulting initial co-saliency maps are enhanced by seed
propagation steps over an integrated graph. The deep saliency networks are
trained in a supervised manner to avoid online weakly supervised learning and
exploit them not only to extract high-level features but also to produce both
intra- and inter-image saliency maps. Through a refinement step, the initial
co-saliency maps can uniformly highlight co-salient regions and locate accurate
object boundaries. To handle input image groups inconsistent in size, we
propose to pool multi-regional descriptors including both within-segment and
within-group information. In addition, the integrated multilayer graph is
constructed to find the regions that the previous steps may not detect by seed
propagation with low-level descriptors. In this work, we utilize the useful
complementary components of high-, low-level information, and several
learning-based steps. Our experiments have demonstrated that the proposed
approach outperforms comparable co-saliency detection methods on widely used
public databases and can also be directly applied to co-segmentation tasks.

 <dc:description>  We propose a method for efficiently coupling the finite element method with
atomistic simulations, while using molecular dynamics or kinetic Monte Carlo
techniques. Our method can dynamically build an optimized unstructured mesh
that follows the geometry defined by atomistic data. On this mesh, different
multiphysics problems can be solved to obtain distributions of physical
quantities of interest, which can be fed back to the atomistic system. The
simulation flow is optimized to maximize computational efficiency while
maintaining good accuracy. This is achieved by providing the modules for a)
optimization of the density of the generated mesh according to requirements of
a specific geometry and b) efficient extension of the finite element domain
without a need to extend the atomistic one. Our method is organized as an
open-source C++ code. In the current implementation, an efficient Laplace
equation solver for calculation of electric field distribution near rough
atomistic surface demonstrates the capability of the suggested approach.

 <dc:description>  In the past three decades, many theoretical measures of complexity have been
proposed to help understand complex systems. In this work, for the first time,
we place these measures on a level playing field, to explore the qualitative
similarities and differences between them, and their shortcomings.
Specifically, using the Boltzmann machine architecture (a fully connected
recurrent neural network) with uniformly distributed weights as our model of
study, we numerically measure how complexity changes as a function of network
dynamics and network parameters. We apply an extension of one such
information-theoretic measure of complexity to understand incremental Hebbian
learning in Hopfield networks, a fully recurrent architecture model of
autoassociative memory. In the course of Hebbian learning, the total
information flow reflects a natural upward trend in complexity as the network
attempts to learn more and more patterns.

 <dc:title>Improving Distributed Representations of Tweets - Present and Future</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>J, Ganesh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Unsupervised representation learning for tweets is an important research
field which helps in solving several business applications such as sentiment
analysis, hashtag prediction, paraphrase detection and microblog ranking. A
good tweet representation learning model must handle the idiosyncratic nature
of tweets which poses several challenges such as short length, informal words,
unusual grammar and misspellings. However, there is a lack of prior work which
surveys the representation learning models with a focus on tweets. In this
work, we organize the models based on its objective function which aids the
understanding of the literature. We also provide interesting future directions,
which we believe are fruitful in advancing this field by building high-quality
tweet representation learning models.

 <dc:description>  Phased antenna arrays are widely used for direction-of-arrival (DoA)
estimation. For low-cost applications, signal power or received signal strength
indicator (RSSI) based approaches can be an alternative. However, they usually
require multiple antennas, a single antenna that can be rotated, or switchable
antenna beams. In this paper we show how a multi-mode antenna (MMA) can be used
for power-based DoA estimation. Only a single MMA is needed and neither
rotation nor switching of antenna beams is required. We derive an estimation
scheme as well as theoretical bounds and validate them through simulations. It
is found that power-based DoA estimation with an MMA is feasible and accurate.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMMs) have been used to
enhance the recognition performance of text-dependent speaker identification in
the shouted environment. Our speech database consists of two databases: our
collected database and the Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS)
database. Our results show that SPHMMs significantly enhance speaker
identification performance compared to Second-Order Circular Hidden Markov
Models (CHMM2s) in the shouted environment. Using our collected database,
speaker identification performance in this environment is 68% and 75% based on
CHMM2s and SPHMMs respectively. Using the SUSAS database, speaker
identification performance in the same environment is 71% and 79% based on
CHMM2s and SPHMMs respectively.

 <dc:description>  From linear classifiers to neural networks, image classification has been a
widely explored topic in mathematics, and many algorithms have proven to be
effective classifiers. However, the most accurate classifiers typically have
significantly high storage costs, or require complicated procedures that may be
computationally expensive. We present a novel (nonlinear) classification
approach using truncation of local tensor singular value decompositions (tSVD)
that robustly offers accurate results, while maintaining manageable storage
costs. Our approach takes advantage of the optimality of the representation
under the tensor algebra described to determine to which class an image
belongs. We extend our approach to a method that can determine specific
pairwise match scores, which could be useful in, for example, object
recognition problems where pose/position are different. We demonstrate the
promise of our new techniques on the MNIST data set.

 <dc:title>On the relation between representations and computability</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  One of the fundamental results in computability is the existence of
well-defined functions that cannot be computed. In this paper we study the
effects of data representation on computability; we show that, while for each
possible way of representing data there exist incomputable functions, the
computability of a specific abstract function is never an absolute property,
but depends on the representation used for the function domain. We examine the
scope of this dependency and provide mathematical criteria to favour some
representations over others. As we shall show, there are strong reasons to
suggest that computational enumerability should be an additional axiom for
computation models. We analyze the link between the techniques and effects of
representation changes and those of oracle machines, showing an important
connection between their hierarchies. Finally, these notions enable us to gain
a new insight on the Church-Turing thesis: its interpretation as the underlying
algebraic structure to which computation is invariant.

 <dc:title>Linking Sketches and Diagrams to Source Code Artifacts</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent studies have shown that sketches and diagrams play an important role
in the daily work of software developers. If these visual artifacts are
archived, they are often detached from the source code they document, because
there is no adequate tool support to assist developers in capturing, archiving,
and retrieving sketches related to certain source code artifacts. This paper
presents SketchLink, a tool that aims at increasing the value of sketches and
diagrams created during software development by supporting developers in these
tasks. Our prototype implementation provides a web application that employs the
camera of smartphones and tablets to capture analog sketches, but can also be
used on desktop computers to upload, for instance, computer-generated diagrams.
We also implemented a plugin for a Java IDE that embeds the links in Javadoc
comments and visualizes them in situ in the source code editor as graphical
icons.

 <dc:description>  In classical coding theory, Gray isometries are usually defined as mappings
between finite Frobenius rings, which include the ring $Z_m$ of integers modulo
$m$, and the finite fields. In this paper, we derive an isometric mapping from
$Z_8$ to $Z_4^2$ from the composition of the Gray isometries on $Z_8$ and on
$Z_4^2$. The image under this composition of a $Z_8$-linear block code of
length $n$ with homogeneous distance $d$ is a (not necessarily linear)
quaternary block code of length $2n$ with Lee distance $d$.

 <dc:description>  Reaction delays are important in determining the qualitative dynamical
properties of a platoon of vehicles traveling on a straight road. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of delayed feedback on the dynamics of the
Modified Optimal Velocity Model (MOVM). Specifically, we analyze the MOVM in
three regimes -- no delay, small delay and arbitrary delay. In the absence of
reaction delays, we show that the MOVM is locally stable. For small delays, we
then derive a sufficient condition for the MOVM to be locally stable. Next, for
an arbitrary delay, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for the
local stability of the MOVM. We show that the traffic flow transits from the
locally stable to the locally unstable regime via a Hopf bifurcation. We also
derive the necessary and sufficient condition for non-oscillatory convergence
and characterize the rate of convergence of the MOVM. These conditions help
ensure smooth traffic flow, good ride quality and quick equilibration to the
uniform flow. Further, since a Hopf bifurcation results in the emergence of
limit cycles, we provide an analytical framework to characterize the type of
the Hopf bifurcation and the asymptotic orbital stability of the resulting
non-linear oscillations. Finally, we corroborate our analyses using stability
charts, bifurcation diagrams, numerical computations and simulations conducted
using MATLAB.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses about needs and ways to improve predictive maintenance
in the future while facilitating the electric utilities to make smarter
decisions about when and where maintenance should be performed. Utilities have
been collecting data in large amounts but they are hardly utilized because they
are huge in amount and also there is uncertainty associated with it. Condition
monitoring of assets collects large amounts of data during daily operations.
The question arises 'How to extract information from this large chunk of data?'
The concept of 'rich data and poor information' is being challenged by big data
analytics. Along with technological advancements like Internet of Things, big
data analytics will play an important role for electric utilities. The aim will
be to make the current asset management more smarter than it was, and this work
describes some pathways.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach to support partiality in type-level computation
without compromising expressiveness or type safety. Existing frameworks for
type-level computation either require totality or implicitly assume it. For
example, type families in Haskell provide a powerful, modular means of defining
type-level computation. However, their current design implicitly assumes that
type families are total, introducing nonsensical types and significantly
complicating the metatheory of type families and their extensions. We propose
an alternative design, using qualified types to pair type-level computations
with predicates that capture their domains. Our approach naturally captures the
intuitive partiality of type families, simplifying their metatheory. As
evidence, we present the first complete proof of consistency for a language
with closed type families.

 <dc:title>Enhancing speaker identification performance under the shouted talking

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is known that the performance of speaker identification systems is high
under the neutral talking condition; however, the performance deteriorates
under the shouted talking condition. In this paper, second-order circular
hidden Markov models (CHMM2s) have been proposed and implemented to enhance the
performance of isolated-word text-dependent speaker identification systems
under the shouted talking condition. Our results show that CHMM2s significantly
improve speaker identification performance under such a condition compared to
the first-order left-to-right hidden Markov models (LTRHMM1s), second-order
left-to-right hidden Markov models (LTRHMM2s), and the first-order circular
hidden Markov models (CHMM1s). Under the shouted talking condition, our results
show that the average speaker identification performance is 23% based on
LTRHMM1s, 59% based on LTRHMM2s, and 60% based on CHMM1s. On the other hand,
the average speaker identification performance under the same talking condition
based on CHMM2s is 72%.

 <dc:title>Iterative Spectral Clustering for Unsupervised Object Localization</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Raman, Shanmuganathan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised object localization in an
image. Unlike previous supervised and weakly supervised algorithms that require
bounding box or image level annotations for training classifiers in order to
learn features representing the object, we propose a simple yet effective
technique for localization using iterative spectral clustering. This iterative
spectral clustering approach along with appropriate cluster selection strategy
in each iteration naturally helps in searching of object region in the image.
In order to estimate the final localization window, we group the proposals
obtained from the iterative spectral clustering step based on the perceptual
similarity, and average the coordinates of the proposals from the top scoring
groups. We benchmark our algorithm on challenging datasets like Object

 <dc:title>Employing Second-Order Circular Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models to
  Enhance Speaker Identification Performance in Shouted Talking Environments</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shahin, Ismail</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Speaker identification performance is almost perfect in neutral talking
environments; however, the performance is deteriorated significantly in shouted
talking environments. This work is devoted to proposing, implementing and
evaluating new models called Second-Order Circular Suprasegmental Hidden Markov
Models (CSPHMM2s) to alleviate the deteriorated performance in the shouted
talking environments. These proposed models possess the characteristics of both
Circular Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (CSPHMMs) and Second-Order
Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMM2s). The results of this work show
that CSPHMM2s outperform each of: First-Order Left-to-Right Suprasegmental
Hidden Markov Models (LTRSPHMM1s), Second-Order Left-to-Right Suprasegmental
Hidden Markov Models (LTRSPHMM2s) and First-Order Circular Suprasegmental
Hidden Markov Models (CSPHMM1s) in the shouted talking environments. In such
talking environments and using our collected speech database, average speaker
identification performance based on LTRSPHMM1s, LTRSPHMM2s, CSPHMM1s and
CSPHMM2s is 74.6%, 78.4%, 78.7% and 83.4%, respectively. Speaker identification
performance obtained based on CSPHMM2s is close to that obtained based on
subjective assessment by human listeners.

 <dc:title>Kinematics and workspace analysis of a 3ppps parallel robot with

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the kinematic analysis of the 3-PPPS parallel robot with
an equilateral mobile platform and a U-shape base. The proposed design and
appropriate selection of parameters allow to formulate simpler direct and
inverse kinematics for the manipulator under study. The parallel singularities
associated with the manipulator depend only on the orientation of the
end-effector, and thus depend only on the orientation of the end effector. The
quaternion parameters are used to represent the aspects, i.e. the singularity
free regions of the workspace. A cylindrical algebraic decomposition is used to
characterize the workspace and joint space with a low number of cells. The
dis-criminant variety is obtained to describe the boundaries of each cell. With
these simplifications, the 3-PPPS parallel robot with proposed design can be
claimed as the simplest 6 DOF robot, which further makes it useful for the
industrial applications.

 <dc:description>  With the generalization of mobile communication systems, solicitations of all
kinds in the form of messages and emails are received by users with increasing
proportion of malicious ones. They are customized to pass anti-spam filters and
ask the person to click or to open the joined dangerous attachment. Current
filters are very inefficient against spear phishing emails. It is proposed to
improve the existing filters by taking advantage of user own analysis and
feedback to detect all kinds of phishing emails. The method rests upon an
interface displaying different warnings to receivers. Analysis shows that users
trust their first impression and are often lead to ignore warnings flagged by
proposed new interactive system.

 <dc:title>Talking Condition Recognition in Stressful and Emotional Talking

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work is aimed at exploiting Second-Order Circular Suprasegmental Hidden
Markov Models (CSPHMM2s) as classifiers to enhance talking condition
recognition in stressful and emotional talking environments (completely two
separate environments). The stressful talking environment that has been used in
this work uses Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) database, while
the emotional talking environment uses Emotional Prosody Speech and Transcripts
(EPST) database. The achieved results of this work using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs) demonstrate that CSPHMM2s outperform each of Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs), Second-Order Circular Hidden Markov Models (CHMM2s), and
Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMMs) in enhancing talking condition
recognition in the stressful and emotional talking environments. The results
also show that the performance of talking condition recognition in stressful
talking environments leads that in emotional talking environments by 3.67%
based on CSPHMM2s. Our results obtained in subjective evaluation by human
judges fall within 2.14% and 3.08% of those obtained, respectively, in
stressful and emotional talking environments based on CSPHMM2s.

 <dc:title>Stronger Baselines for Trustable Results in Neural Machine Translation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Denkowski, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Neubig, Graham</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Interest in neural machine translation has grown rapidly as its effectiveness
has been demonstrated across language and data scenarios. New research
regularly introduces architectural and algorithmic improvements that lead to
significant gains over &quot;vanilla&quot; NMT implementations. However, these new
techniques are rarely evaluated in the context of previously published
techniques, specifically those that are widely used in state-of-theart
production and shared-task systems. As a result, it is often difficult to
determine whether improvements from research will carry over to systems
deployed for real-world use. In this work, we recommend three specific methods
that are relatively easy to implement and result in much stronger experimental
systems. Beyond reporting significantly higher BLEU scores, we conduct an
in-depth analysis of where improvements originate and what inherent weaknesses
of basic NMT models are being addressed. We then compare the relative gains
afforded by several other techniques proposed in the literature when starting
with vanilla systems versus our stronger baselines, showing that experimental
conclusions may change depending on the baseline chosen. This indicates that
choosing a strong baseline is crucial for reporting reliable experimental
results.

 <dc:title>Speaking Style Authentication Using Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shahin, Ismail</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The importance of speaking style authentication from human speech is gaining
an increasing attention and concern from the engineering community. The
importance comes from the demand to enhance both the naturalness and efficiency
of spoken language human-machine interface. Our work in this research focuses
on proposing, implementing, and testing speaker-dependent and text-dependent
speaking style authentication (verification) systems that accept or reject the
identity claim of a speaking style based on suprasegmental hidden Markov models
(SPHMMs). Based on using SPHMMs, our results show that the average speaking
style authentication performance is: 99%, 37%, 85%, 60%, 61%, 59%, 41%, 61%,
and 57% belonging respectively to the speaking styles: neutral, shouted, slow,
loud, soft, fast, angry, happy, and fearful.

 <dc:title>Indoor UAV scheduling with Restful Task Assignment Algorithm</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Khosiawan, Yohanes</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Nielsen, Izabela</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Research in UAV scheduling has obtained an emerging interest from scientists
in the optimization field. When the scheduling itself has established a strong
root since the 19th century, works on UAV scheduling in indoor environment has
come forth in the latest decade. Several works on scheduling UAV operations in
indoor (two and three dimensional) and outdoor environments are reported. In
this paper, a further study on UAV scheduling in three dimensional indoor
environment is investigated. Dealing with indoor environment\textemdash where
humans, UAVs, and other elements or infrastructures are likely to coexist in
the same space\textemdash draws attention towards the safety of the operations.
In relation to the battery level, a preserved battery level leads to safer
operations, promoting the UAV to have a decent remaining power level. A
methodology which consists of a heuristic approach based on Restful Task
Assignment Algorithm, incorporated with Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm,
is proposed. The motivation is to preserve the battery level throughout the
operations, which promotes less possibility in having failed UAVs on duty. This
methodology is tested with 54 benchmark datasets stressing on 4 different
aspects: geographical distance, number of tasks, number of predecessors, and
slack time. The test results and their characteristics in regard to the
proposed methodology are discussed and presented.

 <dc:description>  An increasing amount of digital music is being published daily. Music
streaming services often ingest all available music, but this poses a
challenge: how to recommend new artists for which prior knowledge is scarce? In
this work we aim to address this so-called cold-start problem by combining text
and audio information with user feedback data using deep network architectures.
Our method is divided into three steps. First, artist embeddings are learned
from biographies by combining semantics, text features, and aggregated usage
data. Second, track embeddings are learned from the audio signal and available
feedback data. Finally, artist and track embeddings are combined in a
multimodal network. Results suggest that both splitting the recommendation
problem between feature levels (i.e., artist metadata and audio track), and
merging feature embeddings in a multimodal approach improve the accuracy of the
recommendations.

(AP16-OLR), the new challenge involves more languages and focuses more on short
utterances. The data is offered by SpeechOcean and the NSFC M2ASR project. Two
types of baselines are constructed to assist the participants, one is based on
the i-vector model and the other is based on various neural networks. We report
the baseline results evaluated with various metrics defined by the AP17-OLR
evaluation plan and demonstrate that the combined database is a reasonable data
resource for multilingual research. All the data is free for participants, and
the Kaldi recipes for the baselines have been published online.

 <dc:description>  We perform an asymptotic study of the performance of filter bank multicarrier
(FBMC) in the context of massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO). We show that
the effects of channel distortions, i.e., intersymbol interference and
intercarrier interference, do not vanish as the base station (BS) array size
increases. As a result, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
cannot grow unboundedly by increasing the number of BS antennas, and is upper
bounded by a certain deterministic value. We show that this phenomenon is a
result of the correlation between the multi-antenna combining tap values and
the channel impulse responses between the mobile terminals and the BS antennas.
To resolve this problem, we introduce an efficient equalization method that
removes this correlation, enabling us to achieve arbitrarily large SINR values
by increasing the number of BS antennas. We perform a thorough analysis of the
proposed system and find analytical expressions for both equalizer coefficients
and the respective SINR.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of sampling an edge almost uniformly from an unknown
graph, $G = (V, E)$. Access to the graph is provided via queries of the
following types: (1) uniform vertex queries, (2) degree queries, and (3)
neighbor queries. We describe an algorithm that returns a random edge $e \in E$
using $\tilde{O}(n / \sqrt{\varepsilon m})$ queries in expectation, where $n =
|V|$ is the number of vertices, and $m = |E|$ is the number of edges, such that
each edge $e$ is sampled with probability $(1 \pm \varepsilon)/m$. We prove
that our algorithm is optimal in the sense that any algorithm that samples an
edge from an almost-uniform distribution must perform $\Omega(n / \sqrt{m})$
queries.

 <dc:description>  This study determined the profile and pattern of Internet usage of
respondents in cyber cafes in Manila. The study employed an
exploratory-descriptive design in which a validated descriptive-survey form was
used as the research instrument. Forty-seven cyber cafes in 14 districts in the
City of Manila were randomly selected. There were 545 respondents. It was found
that most of the respondents were Manila settlers (f = 368, 70%), students (f =
382, 73%), pursuing or had attained a college degree (f = 374, 72%), male (f =
356, 68%), young (19 and below) (f = 314, 60%), Roman Catholic (f = 423, 81%),
single (f = 470, 90%), had a computer at home (f = 269, 51%), belonged to the
middle-income class (f = 334, 64%), and used the Internet in the afternoon (f =
274, 50.3%,chi^2 = 113.98, DF = 2, p &lt; 0.01) once to twice a week (f = 193,
36.9%, chi^2 = 90.04, DF = 3, p &lt; 0.01). Frequency of visit of Internet users
was not equally distributed during the week and Internet users showed the
tendency to visit cyber cafes at a particular time of the day when grouped
according to profile. The first hypothesis stated that frequency of visiting a
cyber cafe would not be equally distributed during the week when grouped
according to profile was accepted. The second hypothesis, which stated that
respondents would not show a tendency to use the internet in a cyber cafe at a
particular time of the day was rejected. The study also discusses the
limitations and implications of the findings.

 <dc:title>Bounds on Information Combining With Quantum Side Information</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  &quot;Bounds on information combining&quot; are entropic inequalities that determine
how the information (entropy) of a set of random variables can change when
these are combined in certain prescribed ways. Such bounds play an important
role in classical information theory, particularly in coding and Shannon
theory; entropy power inequalities are special instances of them. The arguably
most elementary kind of information combining is the addition of two binary
random variables (a CNOT gate), and the resulting quantities play an important
role in Belief propagation and Polar coding. We investigate this problem in the
setting where quantum side information is available, which has been recognized
as a hard setting for entropy power inequalities.
  Our main technical result is a non-trivial, and close to optimal, lower bound
on the combined entropy, which can be seen as an almost optimal &quot;quantum Mrs.
Gerber's Lemma&quot;. Our proof uses three main ingredients: (1) a new bound on the
concavity of von Neumann entropy, which is tight in the regime of low pairwise
state fidelities; (2) the quantitative improvement of strong subadditivity due
to Fawzi-Renner, in which we manage to handle the minimization over recovery
maps; (3) recent duality results on classical-quantum-channels due to Renes et
al. We furthermore present conjectures on the optimal lower and upper bounds
under quantum side information, supported by interesting analytical
observations and strong numerical evidence.
  We finally apply our bounds to Polar coding for binary-input
classical-quantum channels, and show the following three results: (A) Even
non-stationary channels polarize under the polar transform. (B) The blocklength
required to approach the symmetric capacity scales at most sub-exponentially in
the gap to capacity. (C) Under the aforementioned lower bound conjecture, a
blocklength polynomial in the gap suffices.

 <dc:title>Speaker Identification Investigation and Analysis in Unbiased and Biased
  Emotional Talking Environments</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shahin, Ismail</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work aims at investigating and analyzing speaker identification in each
unbiased and biased emotional talking environments based on a classifier called
Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMMs). The first talking environment is
unbiased towards any emotion, while the second talking environment is biased
towards different emotions. Each of these talking environments is made up of
six distinct emotions. These emotions are neutral, angry, sad, happy, disgust
and fear. The investigation and analysis of this work show that speaker
identification performance in the biased talking environment is superior to
that in the unbiased talking environment. The obtained results in this work are
close to those achieved in subjective assessment by human judges.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, second-order hidden Markov model (HMM2) has been used and
implemented to improve the recognition performance of text-dependent speaker
identification systems under neutral talking condition. Our results show that
HMM2 improves the recognition performance under neutral talking condition
compared to the first-order hidden Markov model (HMM1). The recognition
performance has been improved by 9%.

 <dc:title>Employing both Gender and Emotion Cues to Enhance Speaker Identification
  Performance in Emotional Talking Environments</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shahin, Ismail</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Speaker recognition performance in emotional talking environments is not as
high as it is in neutral talking environments. This work focuses on proposing,
implementing, and evaluating a new approach to enhance the performance in
emotional talking environments. The new proposed approach is based on
identifying the unknown speaker using both his/her gender and emotion cues.
Both Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models
(SPHMMs) have been used as classifiers in this work. This approach has been
tested on our collected emotional speech database which is composed of six
emotions. The results of this work show that speaker identification performance
based on using both gender and emotion cues is higher than that based on using
gender cues only, emotion cues only, and neither gender nor emotion cues by
7.22%, 4.45%, and 19.56%, respectively. This work also shows that the optimum
speaker identification performance takes place when the classifiers are
completely biased towards suprasegmental models and no impact of acoustic
models in the emotional talking environments. The achieved average speaker
identification performance based on the new proposed approach falls within
2.35% of that obtained in subjective evaluation by human judges.

 <dc:description>  We study the distribution of strategies in a large game that models how
agents choose among different double auction markets. We classify the possible
mean field Nash equilibria, which include potentially segregated states where
an agent population can split into subpopulations adopting different
strategies. As the game is aggregative, the actual equilibrium strategy
distributions remain undetermined, however. We therefore compare with the
results of Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA) learning, which at long times
leads to Nash equilibria in the appropriate limits of large intensity of
choice, low noise (long agent memory) and perfect imputation of missing scores
(fictitious play). The learning dynamics breaks the indeterminacy of the Nash
equilibria. Non-trivially, depending on how the relevant limits are taken, more
than one type of equilibrium can be selected. These include the standard
homogeneous mixed and heterogeneous pure states, but also \emph{heterogeneous
mixed} states where different agents play different strategies that are not all
pure. The analysis of the EWA learning involves Fokker-Planck modeling combined
with large deviation methods. The theoretical results are confirmed by
multi-agent simulations.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We identify phase noise as a bottleneck for the performance of digital
self-interference cancellers that utilize a single auxiliary
receiver---single-tap digital cancellers---and operate in multipath propagation
environments. Our analysis demonstrates that the degradation due to phase noise
is caused by a mismatch between the analog delay of the auxiliary receiver and
the different delays of the multipath components of the self-interference
signal. We propose a novel multi-tap digital self-interference canceller
architecture that is based on multiple auxiliary receivers and a customized
Normalized-Least-Mean-Squared (NLMS) filtering for self-interference
regeneration. Our simulation results demonstrate that our proposed architecture
is more robust to phase noise impairments and can in some cases achieve 10~dB
larger self-interference cancellation than the single-tap architecture.

 <dc:description>  A numerical semigroup is a subset of N containing 0, closed under addition
and with finite complement in N. An important example of numerical semigroup is
given by the Weierstrass semigroup at one point of a curve. In the theory of
algebraic geometry codes, Weierstrass semigroups are crucial for defining
bounds on the minimum distance as well as for defining improvements on the
dimension of codes. We present these applications and some theoretical problems
related to classification, characterization and counting of numerical
semigroups.

 <dc:title>Speaker Identification in each of the Neutral and Shouted Talking

 <dc:description>  It is well known that speaker identification performs extremely well in the
neutral talking environments; however, the identification performance is
declined sharply in the shouted talking environments. This work aims at
proposing, implementing and testing a new approach to enhance the declined
performance in the shouted talking environments. The new proposed approach is
based on gender-dependent speaker identification using Suprasegmental Hidden
Markov Models (SPHMMs) as classifiers. This proposed approach has been tested
on two different and separate speech databases: our collected database and the
Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress (SUSAS) database. The results of this
work show that gender-dependent speaker identification based on SPHMMs
outperforms gender-independent speaker identification based on the same models
and gender-dependent speaker identification based on Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs) by about 6% and 8%, respectively. The results obtained based on the
proposed approach are close to those obtained in subjective evaluation by human
judges.

 <dc:description>  The use of ontologies and taxonomies contributes by providing means to define
concepts, minimize the ambiguity, improve the interoperability and manage
knowledge of the security domain. Thus, this paper presents a literature survey
on ontologies and taxonomies concerning the Security Assessment domain. We
carried out it to uncover initiatives that aim at formalizing concepts from the
Information Security and Test and Assessment fields of research. We applied a
systematic review approach in seven scientific databases. 138 papers were
identified and divided into categories according to their main contributions,
namely: Ontology, Taxonomy and Survey. Based on their contents, we selected 47
papers on ontologies, 22 papers on taxonomies, and 11 papers on surveys. A
taxonomy has been devised to be used in the evaluation of the papers.
Summaries, tables, and a preliminary analysis of the selected works are
presented. Our main contributions are: 1) an updated literature review,
describing key characteristics, results, research issues, and application
domains of the papers; and 2) the taxonomy for the evaluation process. We have
also detected gaps in the Security Assessment literature that could be the
subject of further studies in the field. This work is meant to be useful for
security researchers who wish to adopt a formal approach in their methods and
techniques.

 <dc:description>  The ability to interpret machine learning models has become increasingly
important now that machine learning is used to inform consequential decisions.
We propose an approach called model extraction for interpreting complex,
blackbox models. Our approach approximates the complex model using a much more
interpretable model; as long as the approximation quality is good, then
statistical properties of the complex model are reflected in the interpretable
model. We show how model extraction can be used to understand and debug random
forests and neural nets trained on several datasets from the UCI Machine
Learning Repository, as well as control policies learned for several classical
reinforcement learning problems.

 <dc:description>  Solving the linear elasticity and Stokes equations by an optimal domain
decomposition method derived algebraically involves the use of non standard
interface conditions. The one-level domain decomposition preconditioners are
based on the solution of local problems. This has the undesired consequence
that the results are not scalable, it means that the number of iterations
needed to reach convergence increases with the number of subdomains. This is
the reason why in this work we introduce, and test numerically, two-level
preconditioners. Such preconditioners use a coarse space in their construction.
We consider the nearly incompressible elasticity problems and Stokes equations,
and discretise them by using two finite element methods, namely, the hybrid
discontinuous Galerkin and Taylor-Hood discretisations.

 <dc:description>  The collective behaviour of people adopting an innovation, product or online
service is commonly interpreted as a spreading phenomenon throughout the fabric
of society. This process is arguably driven by social influence, social
learning and by external effects like media. Observations of such processes
date back to the seminal studies by Rogers and Bass, and their mathematical
modelling has taken two directions: One paradigm, called simple contagion,
identifies adoption spreading with an epidemic process. The other one, named
complex contagion, is concerned with behavioural thresholds and successfully
explains the emergence of large cascades of adoption resulting in a rapid
spreading often seen in empirical data. The observation of real world adoption
processes has become easier lately due to the availability of large digital
social network and behavioural datasets. This has allowed simultaneous study of
network structures and dynamics of online service adoption, shedding light on
the mechanisms and external effects that influence the temporal evolution of
behavioural or innovation adoption. These advancements have induced the
development of more realistic models of social spreading phenomena, which in
turn have provided remarkably good predictions of various empirical adoption
processes. In this chapter we review recent data-driven studies addressing
real-world service adoption processes. Our studies provide the first detailed
empirical evidence of a heterogeneous threshold distribution in adoption. We
also describe the modelling of such phenomena with formal methods and
data-driven simulations. Our objective is to understand the effects of
identified social mechanisms on service adoption spreading, and to provide
potential new directions and open questions for future research.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider energy efficient scheduling in a multiuser setting
where each user has a finite sized queue and there is a cost associated with
holding packets (jobs) in each queue (modeling the delay constraints). The
packets of each user need to be sent over a common channel. The channel
qualities seen by the users are time-varying and differ across users; also, the
cost incurred, i.e., energy consumed, in packet transmission is a function of
the channel quality. We pose the problem as an average cost Markov Decision
Problem, and prove that this problem is Whittle Indexable. Based on this
result, we propose an algorithm in which the Whittle index of each user is
computed and the user who has the lowest value is selected for transmission. We
evaluate the performance of this algorithm via simulations and show that it
achieves a lower average cost than the Maximum Weight Scheduling and Weighted
Fair Scheduling strategies.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) traffic rate
is increasing at a fast pace. The use of satellites is expected to play a large
role in delivering such a traffic. In this work, we investigate the use of two
of the most common M2M/IoT protocols stacks on a satellite Random Access (RA)
channel, based on DVB-RCS2 standard. The metric under consideration is the
completion time, in order to identify the protocol stack that can provide the
best performance level.

 <dc:description>  We develop a technique for transfer learning in machine comprehension (MC)
using a novel two-stage synthesis network (SynNet). Given a high-performing MC
model in one domain, our technique aims to answer questions about documents in
another domain, where we use no labeled data of question-answer pairs. Using
the proposed SynNet with a pretrained model from the SQuAD dataset on the
challenging NewsQA dataset, we achieve an F1 measure of 44.3% with a single
model and 46.6% with an ensemble, approaching performance of in-domain models
(F1 measure of 50.0%) and outperforming the out-of-domain baseline of 7.6%,
without use of provided annotations.

 <dc:description>  We consider the binary classification problem when data are large and subject
to unknown but bounded uncertainties. We address the problem by formulating the
nonlinear support vector machine training problem with robust optimization. To
do so, we analyze and propose two bounding schemes for uncertainties associated
to random approximate features in low dimensional spaces. The proposed
techniques are based on Random Fourier Features and the Nystr\&quot;om methods. The
resulting formulations can be solved with efficient stochastic approximation
techniques such as stochastic (sub)-gradient, stochastic proximal gradient
techniques or their variants.

 <dc:description>  Automated metrics such as BLEU are widely used in the machine translation
literature. They have also been used recently in the dialogue community for
evaluating dialogue response generation. However, previous work in dialogue
response generation has shown that these metrics do not correlate strongly with
human judgment in the non task-oriented dialogue setting. Task-oriented
dialogue responses are expressed on narrower domains and exhibit lower
diversity. It is thus reasonable to think that these automated metrics would
correlate well with human judgment in the task-oriented setting where the
generation task consists of translating dialogue acts into a sentence. We
conduct an empirical study to confirm whether this is the case. Our findings
indicate that these automated metrics have stronger correlation with human
judgments in the task-oriented setting compared to what has been observed in
the non task-oriented setting. We also observe that these metrics correlate
even better for datasets which provide multiple ground truth reference
sentences. In addition, we show that some of the currently available corpora
for task-oriented language generation can be solved with simple models and
advocate for more challenging datasets.

 <dc:title>Robust Face Tracking using Multiple Appearance Models and Graph

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of appearance matching across different
challenges while doing visual face tracking in real-world scenarios. In this
paper, FaceTrack is proposed that utilizes multiple appearance models with its
long-term and short-term appearance memory for efficient face tracking. It
demonstrates robustness to deformation, in-plane and out-of-plane rotation,
scale, distractors and background clutter. It capitalizes on the advantages of
the tracking-by-detection, by using a face detector that tackles drastic scale
appearance change of a face. The detector also helps to reinitialize FaceTrack
during drift. A weighted score-level fusion strategy is proposed to obtain the
face tracking output having the highest fusion score by generating candidates
around possible face locations. The tracker showcases impressive performance
when initiated automatically by outperforming many state-of-the-art trackers,
except Struck by a very minute margin: 0.001 in precision and 0.017 in success
respectively.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops some basic principles to study autocatalytic networks and
exploit their structural properties in order to characterize their inherent
fundamental limits and tradeoffs. In a dynamical system with autocatalytic
structure, the system's output is necessary to catalyze its own production. We
consider a simplified model of Glycolysis pathway as our motivating
application. First, the properties of these class of pathways are investigated
through a simplified two-state model, which is obtained by lumping all the
intermediate reactions into a single intermediate reaction. Then, we generalize
our results to autocatalytic pathways that are composed of a chain of
enzymatically catalyzed intermediate reactions. We explicitly derive a hard
limit on the minimum achievable $\mathcal L_2$-gain disturbance attenuation and
a hard limit on its minimum required output energy. Finally, we show how these
resulting hard limits lead to some fundamental tradeoffs between transient and
steady-state behavior of the network and its net production.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study data-dependent generalization error bounds exhibiting
a mild dependency on the number of classes, making them suitable for
multi-class learning with a large number of label classes. The bounds generally
hold for empirical multi-class risk minimization algorithms using an arbitrary
norm as regularizer. Key to our analysis are new structural results for
multi-class Gaussian complexities and empirical $\ell_\infty$-norm covering
numbers, which exploit the Lipschitz continuity of the loss function with
respect to the $\ell_2$- and $\ell_\infty$-norm, respectively. We establish
data-dependent error bounds in terms of complexities of a linear function class
defined on a finite set induced by training examples, for which we show tight
lower and upper bounds. We apply the results to several prominent multi-class
learning machines, exhibiting a tighter dependency on the number of classes
than the state of the art. For instance, for the multi-class SVM by Crammer and
Singer (2002), we obtain a data-dependent bound with a logarithmic dependency
which significantly improves the previous square-root dependency. Experimental
results are reported to verify the effectiveness of our theoretical findings.

 <dc:description>  Slotted ALOHA (SA) algorithms with Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC)
decoding have received significant attention lately due to their ability to
dramatically increase the throughput of traditional SA. Motivated by increased
density of cellular radio access networks due to the introduction of small
cells, and dramatic increase of user density in Machine-to-Machine (M2M)
communications, SA algorithms with SIC operating cooperatively in multi base
station (BS) scenario are recently considered. In this paper, we generalize our
previous work on Slotted ALOHA with multiple-BS (SA-MBS) by considering users
that use directional antennas. In particular, we focus on a simple randomized
beamforming strategy where, for every packet transmission, a user orients its
main beam in a randomly selected direction. We are interested in the total
achievable system throughput for two decoding scenarios: i) non-cooperative
scenario in which traditional SA operates at each BS independently, and ii)
cooperative SA-MBS in which centralized SIC-based decoding is applied over all
received user signals. For both scenarios, we provide upper system throughput
limits and compare them against the simulation results. Finally, we discuss the
system performance as a function of simple directional antenna model parameters
applied in this paper.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the performance analysis and synthesis of
distributed system throttlers (DST). A throttler is a mechanism that limits the
flow rate of incoming metrics, e.g., byte per second, network bandwidth usage,
capacity, traffic, etc. This can be used to protect a service's backend/clients
from getting overloaded, or to reduce the effects of uncertainties in demand
for shared services. We study performance deterioration of DSTs subject to
demand uncertainty. We then consider network synthesis problems that aim to
improve the performance of noisy DSTs via communication link modifications as
well as server update cycle modifications.

 <dc:description>  Obstacle avoidance is a fundamental requirement for autonomous robots which
operate in, and interact with, the real world. When perception is limited to
monocular vision avoiding collision becomes significantly more challenging due
to the lack of 3D information. Conventional path planners for obstacle
avoidance require tuning a number of parameters and do not have the ability to
directly benefit from large datasets and continuous use. In this paper, a
dueling architecture based deep double-Q network (D3QN) is proposed for
obstacle avoidance, using only monocular RGB vision. Based on the dueling and
double-Q mechanisms, D3QN can efficiently learn how to avoid obstacles in a
simulator even with very noisy depth information predicted from RGB image.
Extensive experiments show that D3QN enables twofold acceleration on learning
compared with a normal deep Q network and the models trained solely in virtual
environments can be directly transferred to real robots, generalizing well to
various new environments with previously unseen dynamic objects.

 <dc:description>  Demand response aims to stimulate electricity consumers to modify their loads
at critical time periods. In this paper, we consider signals in demand response
programs as a binary treatment to the customers and estimate the average
treatment effect, which is the average change in consumption under the demand
response signals. More specifically, we propose to estimate this effect by
linear regression models and derive several estimators based on the different
models. From both synthetic and real data, we show that including more
information about the customers does not always improve estimation accuracy:
the interaction between the side information and the demand response signal
must be carefully modeled. In addition, we compare the traditional linear
regression model with the modified covariate method which models the
interaction between treatment effect and covariates. We analyze the variances
of these estimators and discuss different cases where each respective estimator
works the best. The purpose of these comparisons is not to claim the
superiority of the different methods, rather we aim to provide practical
guidance on the most suitable estimator to use under different settings. Our
results are validated using data collected by Pecan Street and EnergyPlus.

 <dc:description>  We study fairness in collaborative-filtering recommender systems, which are
sensitive to discrimination that exists in historical data. Biased data can
lead collaborative filtering methods to make unfair predictions against
minority groups of users. We identify the insufficiency of existing fairness
metrics and propose four new metrics that address different forms of
unfairness. These fairness metrics can be optimized by adding fairness terms to
the learning objective. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that our
new metrics can better measure fairness than the baseline, and that the
fairness objectives effectively help reduce unfairness.

 <dc:description>  Predictive policing systems are increasingly used to determine how to
allocate police across a city in order to best prevent crime. Discovered crime
data (e.g., arrest counts) are used to help update the model, and the process
is repeated. Such systems have been empirically shown to be susceptible to
runaway feedback loops, where police are repeatedly sent back to the same
neighborhoods regardless of the true crime rate.
  In response, we develop a mathematical model of predictive policing that
proves why this feedback loop occurs, show empirically that this model exhibits
such problems, and demonstrate how to change the inputs to a predictive
policing system (in a black-box manner) so the runaway feedback loop does not
occur, allowing the true crime rate to be learned. Our results are
quantitative: we can establish a link (in our model) between the degree to
which runaway feedback causes problems and the disparity in crime rates between
areas. Moreover, we can also demonstrate the way in which \emph{reported}
incidents of crime (those reported by residents) and \emph{discovered}
incidents of crime (i.e. those directly observed by police officers dispatched
as a result of the predictive policing algorithm) interact: in brief, while
reported incidents can attenuate the degree of runaway feedback, they cannot
entirely remove it without the interventions we suggest.

 <dc:description>  One way to study the physical plausibility of closed timelike curves (CTCs)
is to examine their computational power. This has been done for Deutschian CTCs
(D-CTCs) and post-selection CTCs (P-CTCs), with the result that they allow for
the efficient solution of problems in PSPACE and PP, respectively. Since these
are extremely powerful complexity classes, which are not expected to be
solvable in reality, this can be taken as evidence that these models for CTCs
are pathological. This problem is closely related to the nonlinearity of this
models, which also allows for example cloning quantum states, in the case of
D-CTCs, or distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states, in the case of P-CTCs.
In contrast, the process matrix formalism allows one to model indefinite causal
structures in a \emph{linear} way, getting rid of these effects, and raising
the possibility that its computational power is rather tame. In this paper we
show that process matrices correspond to a linear particular case of P-CTCs,
and therefore that its computational power is upperbounded by that of PP. We
show, furthermore, a family of processes that can violate causal inequalities
but nevertheless can be simulated by a causally ordered quantum circuit with
only a constant overhead, showing that indefinite causality is not necessarily
hard to simulate.

 <dc:title>Topology-Preserving Off-screen Visualization: Effects of Projection

 <dc:description>  With the increasing amount of data being visualized in large information
spaces, methods providing data-driven context have become indispensable.
Off-screen visualization techniques, therefore, have been extensively
researched for their ability to overcome the inherent trade-off between
overview and detail. The general idea is to project off-screen located objects
back to the available screen real estate. Detached visual cues, such as halos
or arrows, encode information on position and distance, but fall short showing
the topology of off-screen objects. For that reason, state of the art
techniques integrate visual cues into a dedicated border region. As yet, the
dimensions of the navigated space are not reflected properly, which is why we
propose to adapt the intrusion of the border pursuant to the position in space.
Moreover, off-screen objects are projected to the border region using one out
of two projection methods: Radial or Orthographic. We describe a controlled
experiment to investigate the effect of the adaptive border intrusion to the
topology as well as the users' intuition regarding the projection strategy. The
results of our experiment suggest to use the orthographic projection strategy
for unconnected point data in an adaptive border design. We further discuss the
results including the given informal feedback of participants.

 <dc:description>  Finding mines in Sonar imagery is a significant problem with a great deal of
relevance for seafaring military and commercial endeavors. Unfortunately, the
lack of enormous Sonar image data sets has prevented automatic target
recognition (ATR) algorithms from some of the same advances seen in other
computer vision fields. Namely, the boom in convolutional neural nets (CNNs)
which have been able to achieve incredible results - even surpassing human
actors - has not been an easily feasible route for many practitioners of Sonar
ATR. We demonstrate the power of one avenue to incorporating CNNs into Sonar
ATR: transfer learning. We first show how well a straightforward, flexible CNN
feature-extraction strategy can be used to obtain impressive if not
state-of-the-art results. Secondly, we propose a way to utilize the powerful
transfer learning approach towards multiple instance target detection and
identification within a provided synthetic aperture Sonar data set.

provide useful insights when applied in software engineering domain, revealing
properties and structures that cannot be captured by traditional metrics. In
this paper, we analyzed the topological properties of Hibernate library, a

The results reveal a complex network with small-world and scale-free
characteristics while displaying a strong propensity on forming communities.

 <dc:description>  Trust models are widely used in various computer science disciplines. The
main purpose of a trust model is to continuously measure trustworthiness of a
set of entities based on their behaviors. In this article, the novel notion of
&quot;rational trust modeling&quot; is introduced by bridging trust management and game
theory. Note that trust models/reputation systems have been used in game theory
(e.g., repeated games) for a long time, however, game theory has not been
utilized in the process of trust model construction; this is where the novelty
of our approach comes from. In our proposed setting, the designer of a trust
model assumes that the players who intend to utilize the model are
rational/selfish, i.e., they decide to become trustworthy or untrustworthy
based on the utility that they can gain. In other words, the players are
incentivized (or penalized) by the model itself to act properly. The problem of
trust management can be then approached by game theoretical analyses and
solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium. Although rationality might be
built-in in some existing trust models, we intend to formalize the notion of
rational trust modeling from the designer's perspective. This approach will
result in two fascinating outcomes. First of all, the designer of a trust model
can incentivise trustworthiness in the first place by incorporating proper
parameters into the trust function, which can be later utilized among selfish
players in strategic trust-based interactions (e.g., e-commerce scenarios).
Furthermore, using a rational trust model, we can prevent many well-known
attacks on trust models. These two prominent properties also help us to predict
behavior of the players in subsequent steps by game theoretical analyses.

 <dc:description>  Random forests are among the most popular classification and regression
methods used in industrial applications. To be effective, the parameters of
random forests must be carefully tuned. This is usually done by choosing values
that minimize the prediction error on a held out dataset. We argue that error
reduction is only one of several metrics that must be considered when
optimizing random forest parameters for commercial applications. We propose a
novel metric that captures the stability of random forests predictions, which
we argue is key for scenarios that require successive predictions. We motivate
the need for multi-criteria optimization by showing that in practical
applications, simply choosing the parameters that lead to the lowest error can
introduce unnecessary costs and produce predictions that are not stable across
independent runs. To optimize this multi-criteria trade-off, we present a new
framework that efficiently finds a principled balance between these three
considerations using Bayesian optimisation. The pitfalls of optimising forest
parameters purely for error reduction are demonstrated using two publicly
available real world datasets. We show that our framework leads to parameter
settings that are markedly different from the values discovered by error
reduction metrics.

 <dc:title>Approximate Maximin Shares for Groups of Agents</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Suksompong, Warut</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigate the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods among
interested agents using the concept of maximin share. Procaccia and Wang showed
that while an allocation that gives every agent at least her maximin share does
not necessarily exist, one that gives every agent at least $2/3$ of her share
always does. In this paper, we consider the more general setting where we
allocate the goods to groups of agents. The agents in each group share the same
set of goods even though they may have conflicting preferences. For two groups,
we characterize the cardinality of the groups for which a constant factor
approximation of the maximin share is possible regardless of the number of
goods. We also show settings where an approximation is possible or impossible
when there are several groups.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural network (CNN) based face detectors are inefficient in
handling faces of diverse scales. They rely on either fitting a large single
model to faces across a large scale range or multi-scale testing. Both are
computationally expensive. We propose Scale-aware Face Detector (SAFD) to
handle scale explicitly using CNN, and achieve better performance with less
computation cost. Prior to detection, an efficient CNN predicts the scale
distribution histogram of the faces. Then the scale histogram guides the
zoom-in and zoom-out of the image. Since the faces will be approximately in
uniform scale after zoom, they can be detected accurately even with much
smaller CNN. Actually, more than 99% of the faces in AFW can be covered with
less than two zooms per image. Extensive experiments on FDDB, MALF and AFW show
advantages of SAFD.

 <dc:description>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently been proposed as a
promising avenue towards learning generative models with deep neural networks.
While GANs have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on multiple vision
tasks, their learning dynamics are not yet well understood, both in theory and
in practice. To address this issue, we take a first step towards a rigorous
study of GAN dynamics. We propose a simple model that exhibits several of the
common problematic convergence behaviors (e.g., vanishing gradient, mode
collapse, diverging or oscillatory behavior) and still allows us to establish
the first convergence bounds for parametric GAN dynamics. We find an
interesting dichotomy: a GAN with an optimal discriminator provably converges,
while a first order approximation of the discriminator leads to unstable GAN
dynamics and mode collapse. Our model and analysis point to a specific
challenge in practical GAN training that we call discriminator collapse.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies optimal time-bounded control in multi-mode systems with
discrete costs. Multi-mode systems are an important subclass of linear hybrid
systems, in which there are no guards on transitions and all invariants are
global. Each state has a continuous cost attached to it, which is linear in the
sojourn time, while a discrete cost is attached to each transition taken. We
show that an optimal control for this model can be computed in NEXPTIME and
approximated in PSPACE. We also show that the one-dimensional case is simpler:
although the problem is NP-complete (and in LOGSPACE for an infinite time
horizon), we develop an FPTAS for finding an approximate solution.

 <dc:title>Automatic Face Image Quality Prediction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Best-Rowden, Lacey</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Face image quality can be defined as a measure of the utility of a face image
to automatic face recognition. In this work, we propose (and compare) two
methods for automatic face image quality based on target face quality values
from (i) human assessments of face image quality (matcher-independent), and
(ii) quality values computed from similarity scores (matcher-dependent). A
support vector regression model trained on face features extracted using a deep
convolutional neural network (ConvNet) is used to predict the quality of a face
image. The proposed methods are evaluated on two unconstrained face image
databases, LFW and IJB-A, which both contain facial variations with multiple
quality factors. Evaluation of the proposed automatic face image quality
measures shows we are able to reduce the FNMR at 1% FMR by at least 13% for two
face matchers (a COTS matcher and a ConvNet matcher) by using the proposed face
quality to select subsets of face images and video frames for matching
templates (i.e., multiple faces per subject) in the IJB-A protocol. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to utilize human assessments of face image
quality in designing a predictor of unconstrained face quality that is shown to
be effective in cross-database evaluation.

 <dc:description>  Recently, a number of grasp detection methods have been proposed that can be
used to localize robotic grasp configurations directly from sensor data without
estimating object pose. The underlying idea is to treat grasp perception
analogously to object detection in computer vision. These methods take as input
a noisy and partially occluded RGBD image or point cloud and produce as output
pose estimates of viable grasps, without assuming a known CAD model of the
object. Although these methods generalize grasp knowledge to new objects well,
they have not yet been demonstrated to be reliable enough for wide use. Many
grasp detection methods achieve grasp success rates (grasp successes as a
fraction of the total number of grasp attempts) between 75% and 95% for novel
objects presented in isolation or in light clutter. Not only are these success
rates too low for practical grasping applications, but the light clutter
scenarios that are evaluated often do not reflect the realities of real world
grasping. This paper proposes a number of innovations that together result in a
significant improvement in grasp detection performance. The specific
improvement in performance due to each of our contributions is quantitatively
measured either in simulation or on robotic hardware. Ultimately, we report a
series of robotic experiments that average a 93% end-to-end grasp success rate
for novel objects presented in dense clutter.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we presented a novel convolutional neural network framework
for graph modeling, with the introduction of two new modules specially designed
for graph-structured data: the $k$-th order convolution operator and the
adaptive filtering module. Importantly, our framework of High-order and
Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (HA-GCN) is a general-purposed
architecture that fits various applications on both node and graph centrics, as
well as graph generative models. We conducted extensive experiments on
demonstrating the advantages of our framework. Particularly, our HA-GCN
outperforms the state-of-the-art models on node classification and molecule
property prediction tasks. It also generates 32% more real molecules on the
molecule generation task, both of which will significantly benefit real-world
applications such as material design and drug screening.

 <dc:description>  Machine-type communication services in mobile cel- lular systems are
currently evolving with an aim to efficiently address a massive-scale user
access to the system. One of the key problems in this respect is to efficiently
identify active users in order to allocate them resources for the subsequent
transmissions. In this paper, we examine two recently suggested approaches for
user activity detection: compressed-sensing (CS) and coded slotted ALOHA (CSA),
and provide their comparison in terms of performance vs resource utilization.
Our preliminary results show that CS-based approach is able to provide the
target user activity detection performance with less overall system resource
utilization. However, this comes at a price of lower energy- efficiency per
user, as compared to CSA-based approach.

 <dc:description>  In wireless communication, heterogeneous technologies such as WiFi, ZigBee
and BlueTooth operate in the same ISM band.With the exponential growth in the
number of wireless devices, the ISM band becomes more and more crowded. These
heterogeneous devices have to compete with each other to access spectrum
resources, generating cross-technology interference (CTI). Since CTI may
destroy wireless communication, this field is facing an urgent and challenging
need to investigate spectrum efficiency under CTI. In this paper, we introduce
a novel framework to address this problem from two aspects. On the one hand,
from the perspective of each communication technology itself, we propose novel
channel/link models to capture the channel/link status under CTI. On the other
hand, we investigate spectrum efficiency from the perspective by taking all
heterogeneous technologies as a whole and building crosstechnology
communication among them. The capability of direct communication among
heterogeneous devices brings great opportunities to harmoniously sharing the
spectrum with collaboration rather than competition.

 <dc:title>Harmonic State Space Modeling of a Three-Phase Modular Multilevel

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the harmonic state space (HSS) modeling of a three-phase
modular multilevel converter (MMC). MMC is a converter system with a typical
multi-frequency response due to its significant harmonics in the arm currents,
capacitor voltages, and control signals. These internal harmonic dynamics can
have a great influence on the operation characteristics of MMC. However, the
conventional modeling methods commonly used in two-level voltage-source
converters (VSCs), where only the fundamental-frequency dynamic is considered,
will lead to an inaccurate model that cannot accurately reflect the real
dynamic characteristics of MMC. Therefore, the HSS modeling method, in which
harmonics of state variables, inputs, and outputs are posed separately in a
state-space form, is introduced in this paper to model the MMC in order to
capture all the harmonics and the frequency couplings. The steady-state and
small-signal dynamic HSS models of a three-phase MMC are developed,
respectively. The validity of the developed HSS model of a three-phase MMC has
been verified by the results from both the nonlinear time domain simulation
model in MATLAB/Simulink and the laboratory prototype with 12 submodules per
arm.

 <dc:description>  Random access protocols relying on the transmission of packet replicas in
multiple slots and exploiting interference cancellation at the receiver have
been shown to achieve per- formance competitive with that of orthogonal
schemes. So far the optimization of the repetition degree profile, defining the
probability for a user to transmit a given number of replicas, has mainly been
performed targeting the collision channel model. In this paper the analysis is
extended to a block fading channel model, also assuming capture effect at the
receiver. Density evolution equations are developed for the new setting and,
based on them, some repetition degree profiles are optimized and analyzed via
Monte Carlo simulation in a finite frame length setting. The derived
distributions are shown to achieve throughputs largely exceeding 1
[packet/slot].

 <dc:description>  Access reservation based on slotted ALOHA is commonly used in wireless
cellular access. In this paper we investigate its enhancement based on the use
of physical-layer network coding and signature coding, whose main feature is
enabling simultaneous resolution of up to K users contending for access, where
K &gt;= 1. We optimise the slot access probability such that the expected
throughput is maximised. In particular, the slot access probability is chosen
in line with an estimate of the number of users in the system that is obtained
relying on the pseudo-Bayesian approach by Rivest, which we generalise for the
case that K &gt; 1. Under the assumption that this estimate reflects the actual
number of users, we show that our approach achieves throughput 1 in the limit
of large K.

 <dc:description>  Finding asymptotically-optimal paths in multi-robot motion planning problems
could be achieved, in principle, using sampling-based planners in the composite
configuration space of all of the robots in the space. The dimensionality of
this space increases with the number of robots, rendering this approach
impractical. This work focuses on a scalable sampling-based planner for coupled
multi-robot problems that provides asymptotic optimality. It extends the dRRT
approach, which proposed building roadmaps for each robot and searching an
implicit roadmap in the composite configuration space. This work presents a new
method, dRRT* , and develops theory for scalable convergence to optimal paths
in multi-robot problems. Simulated experiments indicate dRRT* converges to
high-quality paths while scaling to higher numbers of robots where the naive
approach fails. Furthermore, dRRT* is applicable to high-dimensional problems,
such as planning for robot manipulators

 <dc:description>  In contrast to electronic computation, chemical computation is noisy and
susceptible to a variety of sources of error, which has prevented the
construction of robust complex systems. To be effective, chemical algorithms
must be designed with an appropriate error model in mind. Here we consider the
model of chemical reaction networks that preserve molecular count (population
protocols), and ask whether computation can be made robust to a natural model
of unintended &quot;leak&quot; reactions. Our definition of leak is motivated by both the
particular spurious behavior seen when implementing chemical reaction networks
with DNA strand displacement cascades, as well as the unavoidable side
reactions in any implementation due to the basic laws of chemistry. We develop
a new &quot;Robust Detection&quot; algorithm for the problem of fast (logarithmic time)
single molecule detection, and prove that it is robust to this general model of
leaks. Besides potential applications in single molecule detection, the
error-correction ideas developed here might enable a new class of
robust-by-design chemical algorithms. Our analysis is based on a non-standard
hybrid argument, combining ideas from discrete analysis of population protocols
with classic Markov chain techniques.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by applications in online social networks, we introduce and study
the problem of Community Detection on a new class of sparse \emph{spatial}
random graphs embedded in the Euclidean space. Our random graph is the
planted-partition version of the classical random connection model studied in
Stochastic Geometry. Roughly speaking, each node of our graph has an uniform
i.i.d. $\{-1,+1\}$ valued community label and a $\mathbb{R}^d$ valued location
label given by the support of a homogeneous Poisson point process of intensity
$\lambda$. Conditional on the labels, edges are drawn independently at random
depending both on the Euclidean distance between the nodes and the community
labels on the nodes. We study the Community Detection problem on this random
graph which consists in estimating the partition of nodes into communities,
based on an observation of the random graph along with the spatial location
labels on nodes.
  We show that for $d=1$, Community Detection is impossible for any parameters.
For $d \geq 2$, we establish a phase-transition based on the intensity
$\lambda$ of the point process. In particular, we show that if the intensity
$\lambda$ is small, then no algorithm for community detection can beat a random
guess for the partitions. We prove this by introducing and analyzing a new
problem which we call `Information Flow from Infinity'. On the positive side,
we give a novel algorithm that performs Community Detection as long as the
intensity $\lambda$ is larger than a sufficiently high constant. Along the way,
we establish a \emph{distinguishability} result which says that one can always
efficiently infer the existence of a partition given the graph and the spatial
locations even when one cannot identify the partition better than at random.
This is a surprising new phenomenon not observed thus far in any non-spatial
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi based planted-partition models.

 <dc:description>  Energy harvesting is a promising technology for the Internet of Things (IoT)
towards the goal of self-sustainability of the involved devices. However, the
intermittent and unreliable nature of the harvested energy demands an
intelligent management of devices' operation in order to ensure a sustained
performance of the IoT application. In this work, we address the problem of
maximizing the quality of the reported data under the constraints of energy
harvesting, energy consumption and communication channel impairments.
Specifically, we propose an energy-aware joint source-channel coding scheme
that minimizes the expected data distortion, for realistic models of energy
generation and of the energy spent by the device to process the data, when the
communication is performed over a Rayleigh fading channel. The performance of
the scheme is optimized by means of a Markov Decision Process framework.

 <dc:description>  EEE 802.11ah is a novel WiFi-based protocol, aiming to provide an access
solution for the machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. In this paper, we
propose an adaptive access mechanism that can be seamlessly incorporated into
IEEE 802.11ah protocol operation and that supports all potential M2M reporting
regimes, which are periodic, on-demand We show that it is possible to both
efficiently and reliably resolve all reporting stations in the cell, within the

for modeling the inter-arrival time in alarm events by using the Beta
distribution, a model that is considered in the 3GPP standardization.

 <dc:description>  This work studies rearrangement problems involving the sorting of robots or
objects in stack-like containers, which can be accessed only from one side. Two
scenarios are considered: one where every robot or object needs to reach a
particular stack, and a setting in which each robot has a distinct position
within a stack. In both cases, the goal is to minimize the number of stack
removals that need to be performed. Stack rearrangement is shown to be
intimately connected to pebble motion problems, a useful abstraction in
multi-robot path planning. Through this connection, feasibility of stack
rearrangement can be readily addressed. The paper continues to establish lower
and upper bounds on optimality, which differ only by a logarithmic factor, in
terms of stack removals. An algorithmic solution is then developed that
produces suboptimal paths much quicker than a pebble motion solver.
Furthermore, informed search-based methods are proposed for finding
high-quality solutions. The efficiency and desirable scalability of the methods
is demonstrated in simulation.

 <dc:description>  Graph algorithms and techniques are increasingly being used in scientific and
commercial applications to express relations and explore large data sets.
Although conventional or commodity computer architectures, like CPU or GPU, can
compute fairly well dense graph algorithms, they are often inadequate in
processing large sparse graph applications. Memory access patterns, memory
bandwidth requirements and on-chip network communications in these applications
do not fit in the conventional program execution flow. In this work, we propose
and design a new architecture for fast processing of large graph applications.
To leverage the lack of the spatial and temporal localities in these
applications and to support scalable computational models, we design the
architecture around two key concepts. (1) The architecture is a multicore
processor of independently clocked processing elements. These elements
communicate in a self-timed manner and use handshaking to perform
synchronization, communication, and sequencing of operations. By being
asynchronous, the operating speed at each processing element is determined by
actual local latencies rather than global worst-case latencies. We create a
specialized ISA to support these operations. (2) The application compilation
and mapping process uses a graph clustering algorithm to optimize parallel
computing of graph operations and load balancing. Through the clustering
process, we make scalability an inherent property of the architecture where
task-to-element mapping can be done at the graph node level or at node cluster
level. A prototyped version of the architecture outperforms a comparable CPU by
10~20x across all benchmarks and provides 2~5x better power efficiency when
compared to a GPU.

 <dc:title>On Conceptually Simple Algorithms for Variants of Online Bipartite
  Matching</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Borodin, Allan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a series of results regarding conceptually simple algorithms for
bipartite matching in various online and related models. We first consider a
deterministic adversarial model. The best approximation ratio possible for a
one-pass deterministic online algorithm is $1/2$, which is achieved by any
greedy algorithm. D\&quot;urr et al. recently presented a $2$-pass algorithm called
Category-Advice that achieves approximation ratio $3/5$. We extend their
algorithm to multiple passes. We prove the exact approximation ratio for the
$k$-pass Category-Advice algorithm for all $k \ge 1$, and show that the
approximation ratio converges to the inverse of the golden ratio
$2/(1+\sqrt{5}) \approx 0.618$ as $k$ goes to infinity. The convergence is
extremely fast --- the $5$-pass Category-Advice algorithm is already within
$0.01\%$ of the inverse of the golden ratio.
  We then consider a natural greedy algorithm in the online stochastic IID
model---MinDegree. This algorithm is an online version of a well-known and
extensively studied offline algorithm MinGreedy. We show that MinDegree cannot
achieve an approximation ratio better than $1-1/e$, which is guaranteed by any
consistent greedy algorithm in the known IID model.
  Finally, following the work in Besser and Poloczek, we depart from an
adversarial or stochastic ordering and investigate a natural randomized
algorithm (MinRanking) in the priority model. Although the priority model
allows the algorithm to choose the input ordering in a general but well defined
way, this natural algorithm cannot obtain the approximation of the Ranking
algorithm in the ROM model.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of phase retrieval, i.e. that of solving systems of
quadratic equations. A simple variant of the randomized Kaczmarz method was
recently proposed for phase retrieval, and it was shown numerically to have a
computational edge over state-of-the-art Wirtinger flow methods. In this paper,
we provide the first theoretical guarantee for the convergence of the
randomized Kaczmarz method for phase retrieval. We show that it is sufficient
to have as many Gaussian measurements as the dimension, up to a constant
factor. Along the way, we introduce a sufficient condition on measurement sets
for which the randomized Kaczmarz method is guaranteed to work. We show that
Gaussian sampling vectors satisfy this property with high probability; this is
proved using a chaining argument coupled with bounds on VC dimension and metric
entropy.

 <dc:description>  In this work we introduce the concept of a sub-space decomposition, subject
to a partition of the coordinates. Considering metrics determined by partial
orders in the set of coordinates, the so called poset metrics, we show the
existence of maximal decompositions according to the metric. These
decompositions turns to be an important tool to obtain the canonical form for
codes over any poset metrics and to obtain bounds for important invariants such
as the packing radius of a linear subspace. Furthermore, using maximal
decompositions, we are able to reduce and optimize the full lookup table
algorithm for the syndrome decoding process.

 <dc:description>  We consider the following balls-into-bins process with $n$ bins and $m$
balls: each ball is equipped with a mutually independent exponential clock of
rate 1. Whenever a ball's clock rings, the ball samples a random bin and moves
there if the number of balls in the sampled bin is smaller than in its current
bin. This simple process models a typical load balancing problem where users
(balls) seek a selfish improvement of their assignment to resources (bins).
From a game theoretic perspective, this is a randomized approach to the
well-known Koutsoupias-Papadimitriou model, while it is known as randomized
local search (RLS) in load balancing literature. Up to now, the best bound on
the expected time to reach perfect balance was $O\left({(\ln n)}^2+\ln(n)\cdot
n^2/m\right)$ due to Ganesh, Lilienthal, Manjunath, Proutiere, and Simatos
(Load balancing via random local search in closed and open systems, Queueing
Systems, 2012). We improve this to an asymptotically tight
$O\left(\ln(n)+n^2/m\right)$. Our analysis is based on the crucial observation
that performing &quot;destructive moves&quot; (reversals of RLS moves) cannot decrease
the balancing time. This allows us to simplify problem instances and to ignore
&quot;inconvenient moves&quot; in the analysis.

 <dc:description>  We consider the goodness-of-fit testing problem of distinguishing whether the
data are drawn from a specified distribution, versus a composite alternative
separated from the null in the total variation metric. In the discrete case, we
consider goodness-of-fit testing when the null distribution has a possibly
growing or unbounded number of categories. In the continuous case, we consider
testing a Lipschitz density, with possibly unbounded support, in the
low-smoothness regime where the Lipschitz parameter is not assumed to be
constant. In contrast to existing results, we show that the minimax rate and
critical testing radius in these settings depend strongly, and in a precise
way, on the null distribution being tested and this motivates the study of the
(local) minimax rate as a function of the null distribution. For multinomials
the local minimax rate was recently studied in the work of Valiant and Valiant.
We re-visit and extend their results and develop two modifications to the
chi-squared test whose performance we characterize. For testing Lipschitz
densities, we show that the usual binning tests are inadequate in the
low-smoothness regime and we design a spatially adaptive partitioning scheme
that forms the basis for our locally minimax optimal tests. Furthermore, we
provide the first local minimax lower bounds for this problem which yield a
sharp characterization of the dependence of the critical radius on the null
hypothesis being tested. In the low-smoothness regime we also provide adaptive
tests, that adapt to the unknown smoothness parameter. We illustrate our
results with a variety of simulations that demonstrate the practical utility of
our proposed tests.

 <dc:description>  We present the first approach to automated audio captioning. We employ an
encoder-decoder scheme with an alignment model in between. The input to the
encoder is a sequence of log mel-band energies calculated from an audio file,
while the output is a sequence of words, i.e. a caption. The encoder is a
multi-layered, bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) and the decoder a
multi-layered GRU with a classification layer connected to the last GRU of the
decoder. The classification layer and the alignment model are fully connected
layers with shared weights between timesteps. The proposed method is evaluated
using data drawn from a commercial sound effects library, ProSound Effects. The
resulting captions were rated through metrics utilized in machine translation
and image captioning fields. Results from metrics show that the proposed method
can predict words appearing in the original caption, but not always correctly
ordered.

 <dc:description>  Social goods are goods that grant value not only to their owners but also to
the owners' surroundings, be it their families, friends or office mates. The
benefit a non-owner derives from the good is affected by many factors,
including the type of the good, its availability, and the social status of the
non-owner. Depending on the magnitude of the benefit and on the price of the
good, a potential buyer might stay away from purchasing the good, hoping to
free ride on others' purchases. A revenue-maximizing seller who sells social
goods must take these considerations into account when setting prices for the
good. The literature on optimal pricing has advanced considerably over the last
decade, but little is known about optimal pricing schemes for selling social
goods. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of revenue-maximizing
pricing schemes for social goods: we introduce a Bayesian model for this
scenario, and devise nearly-optimal pricing schemes for various types of
externalities, both for simultaneous sales and for sequential sales.

 <dc:title>Fine-Grained Reliability for V2V Communications around Suburban and
  Urban Intersections</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Abdulla, Mouhamed</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Safe transportation is a key use-case of the 5G/LTE Rel.15+ communications,
where an end-to-end reliability of 0.99999 is expected for a vehicle-to-vehicle
(V2V) transmission distance of 100-200 m. Since communications reliability is
related to road-safety, it is crucial to verify the fulfillment of the
performance, especially for accident-prone areas such as intersections. We
derive closed-form expressions for the V2V transmission reliability near
suburban corners and urban intersections over finite interference regions. The
analysis is based on plausible street configurations, traffic scenarios, and
empirically-supported channel propagation. We show the means by which the
performance metric can serve as a preliminary design tool to meet a target
reliability. We then apply meta distribution concepts to provide a careful
dissection of V2V communications reliability. Contrary to existing work on
infinite roads, when we consider finite road segments for practical deployment,
fine-grained reliability per realization exhibits bimodal behavior. Either
performance for a certain vehicular traffic scenario is very reliable or
extremely unreliable, but nowhere in relatively proximity to the average
performance. In other words, standard SINR-based average performance metrics
are analytically accurate but can be insufficient from a practical viewpoint.
Investigating other safety-critical point process networks at the meta
distribution-level may reveal similar discrepancies.

 <dc:description>  Traditional data cleaning identifies dirty data by classifying original data
sequences, which is a class$-$imbalanced problem since the proportion of
incorrect data is much less than the proportion of correct ones for most
diagnostic systems in Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF) devices. When using
machine learning algorithms to classify diagnostic data based on
class$-$imbalanced training set, most classifiers are biased towards the major
class and show very poor classification rates on the minor class. By
transforming the direct classification problem about original data sequences
into a classification problem about the physical similarity between data
sequences, the class$-$balanced effect of Time$-$Domain Global Similarity
(TDGS) method on training set structure is investigated in this paper.
Meanwhile, the impact of improved training set structure on data cleaning
performance of TDGS method is demonstrated with an application example in EAST
POlarimetry$-$INTerferometry (POINT) system.

 <dc:description>  For Time-Domain Global Similarity (TDGS) method, which transforms the data
cleaning problem into a binary classification problem about the physical
similarity between channels, directly adopting common performance measures
could only guarantee the performance for physical similarity. Nevertheless,
practical data cleaning tasks have preferences for the correctness of original
data sequences. To obtain the general expressions of performance measures based
on the preferences of tasks, the mapping relations between performance of TDGS
method about physical similarity and correctness of data sequences are
investigated by probability theory in this paper. Performance measures for TDGS
method in several common data cleaning tasks are set. Cases when these
preference-based performance measures could be simplified are introduced.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a family of mathematical objects called $\mathcal{P}$-schemes,
where $\mathcal{P}$ is a poset of subgroups of a finite group $G$. A
$\mathcal{P}$-scheme is a collection of partitions of the right coset spaces
$H\backslash G$, indexed by $H\in\mathcal{P}$, that satisfies a list of axioms.
These objects generalize the classical notion of association schemes as well as
the notion of $m$-schemes (Ivanyos et al. 2009).
  Based on $\mathcal{P}$-schemes, we develop a unifying framework for the
problem of deterministic factoring of univariate polynomials over finite fields
under the generalized Riemann hypothesis (GRH).

 <dc:description>  The Big Data phenomenon has spawned large-scale linear programming problems.
In many cases, these problems are non-stationary. In this paper, we describe a
new scalable algorithm called NSLP for solving high-dimensional, non-stationary
linear programming problems on modern cluster computing systems. The algorithm
consists of two phases: Quest and Targeting. The Quest phase calculates a
solution of the system of inequalities defining the constraint system of the
linear programming problem under the condition of dynamic changes in input
data. To this end, the apparatus of Fejer mappings is used. The Targeting phase
forms a special system of points having the shape of an n-dimensional
axisymmetric cross. The cross moves in the n-dimensional space in such a way
that the solution of the linear programming problem is located all the time in
an &quot;-vicinity of the central point of the cross.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new neural sequence model training method in which the objective
function is defined by $\alpha$-divergence. We demonstrate that the objective
function generalizes the maximum-likelihood (ML)-based and reinforcement
learning (RL)-based objective functions as special cases (i.e., ML corresponds
to $\alpha \to 0$ and RL to $\alpha \to1$). We also show that the gradient of
the objective function can be considered a mixture of ML- and RL-based
objective gradients. The experimental results of a machine translation task
show that minimizing the objective function with $\alpha &gt; 0$ outperforms
$\alpha \to 0$, which corresponds to ML-based methods.

 <dc:description>  Location-based social network data offers the promise of collecting the data
from a large base of users over a longer span of time at negligible cost. While
several studies have applied social network data to activity and mobility
analysis, a comparison with travel diaries and general statistics has been
lacking. In this paper, we analysed geo-referenced Twitter activities from a
large number of users in Singapore and neighbouring countries. By combining
this data, population statistics and travel diaries and applying clustering
techniques, we addressed detection of activity locations, as well as spatial
separation and transitions between these locations. Kernel density estimation
performs best to detect activity locations due to the scattered nature of the
twitter data; more activity locations are detected per user than reported in
the travel survey. The descriptive analysis shows that determining home
locations is more difficult than detecting work locations for most planning
zones. Spatial separations between detected activity locations from Twitter
data - as reported in a travel survey and captured by public transport smart
card data - are mostly similarly distributed, but also show relevant
differences for very short and very long distances. This also holds for the
transitions between zones. Whether the differences between Twitter data and
other data sources stem from differences in the population sub-sample,
clustering methodology, or whether social networks are being used significantly
more at specific locations must be determined by further research. Despite
these shortcomings, location-based social network data offers a promising data
source for insights into activity locations and mobility patterns, especially
for regions where travel survey data is not readily available.

 <dc:description>  Virtual reality simulation is becoming popular as a training platform in
surgical education. However, one important aspect of simulation-based surgical
training that has not received much attention is the provision of automated
real-time performance feedback to support the learning process. Performance
feedback is actionable advice that improves novice behaviour. In simulation,
automated feedback is typically extracted from prediction models trained using
data mining techniques. Existing techniques suffer from either low
effectiveness or low efficiency resulting in their inability to be used in
real-time. In this paper, we propose a random forest based method that finds a
balance between effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results in a
temporal bone surgery simulation show that the proposed method is able to
extract highly effective feedback at a high level of efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Monitoring is indispensable to check status, activities, or resource usage of
IT services. A combination of Kibana and Elasticsearch is used for monitoring
in many places such as KEK, CC-IN2P3, CERN, and also non-HEP communities.
Kibana provides a web interface for rich visualization, and Elasticsearch is a
scalable distributed search engine. However, these tools do not support
authentication and authorization features by default. In the case of single
Kibana and Elasticsearch services shared among many users, any user who can
access Kibana can retrieve other's information from Elasticsearch. In
multi-user environment, in order to protect own data from others or share part
of data among a group, fine-grained access control is necessary.
  The CERN cloud service group had provided cloud utilization dashboard to each
user by Elasticsearch and Kibana. They had deployed a homemade Elasticsearch
plugin to restrict data access based on a user authenticated by the CERN Single
Sign On system. It enabled each user to have a separated Kibana dashboard for
cloud usage, and the user could not access to other's one. Based on the
solution, we propose an alternative one which enables user/group based
Elasticsearch access control and Kibana objects separation. It is more flexible
and can be applied to not only the cloud service but also the other various
situations. We confirmed our solution works fine in CC-IN2P3. Moreover, a
pre-production platform for CC-IN2P3 has been under construction.
  We will describe our solution for the secure use of Kibana and Elasticsearch
including integration of Kerberos authentication, development of a Kibana
plugin which allows Kibana objects to be separated based on user/group, and
contribution to Search Guard which is an Elasticsearch plugin enabling
user/group based access control. We will also describe the effect on
performance from using Search Guard.

Hamiltonian cycle problem on square, triangular, or hexagonal grid graphs,
restricted to polygonal, thin, superthin, degree-bounded, or solid grid graphs.
They solved many combinations of these problems, proving them either
polynomially solvable or NP-complete, but left three combinations open. In this
paper, we prove two of these unsolved combinations to be NP-complete:
Hamiltonicity of Square Polygonal Grid Graphs and Hamiltonicity of Hexagonal
Thin Grid Graphs. We also consider a new restriction, where the grid graph is
both thin and polygonal, and prove that Hamiltonicity then becomes polynomially
solvable for square, triangular, and hexagonal grid graphs.

 <dc:description>  Power domination in graphs emerged from the problem of monitoring an
electrical system by placing as few measurement devices in the system as
possible. It corresponds to a variant of domination that includes the
possibility of propagation. For measurement devices placed on a set S of
vertices of a graph G, the set of monitored vertices is initially the set S
together with all its neighbors. Then iteratively, whenever some monitored
vertex v has a single neighbor u not yet monitored, u gets monitored. A set S
is said to be a power dominating set of the graph G if all vertices of G
eventually are monitored. The power domination number of a graph is the minimum
size of a power dominating set. In this paper, we prove that any maximal planar
graph of order n $\ge$ 6 admits a power dominating set of size at most (n--2)/4 .

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a (sub)distribution-based bisimulation for labelled
Markov processes and compare it with earlier definitions of state and event
bisimulation, which both only compare states. In contrast to those state-based
bisimulations, our distribution bisimulation is weaker, but corresponds more
closely to linear properties. We construct a logic and a metric to describe our
distribution bisimulation and discuss linearity, continuity and compositional
properties.

 <dc:description>  The application of data mining technique has been widely applied in different
business areas such as health, education and finance for the purpose of data
analysis and then to support and maximizes the organizations customer
satisfaction in an effort to increase loyalty and retain customers business
over their lifetimes . The researchers primary objective, in this paper is to
classify customers based on their common attributes since customer grouping is
the main part of customer relationship management. In this study, different
characteristics of the ERCA customers data were collected from the customs
database called ASYCUDA. Once the customers data were collected, the necessary
data preparation steps were conducted on it and finally a data set consisting
of 46748 records was attained. The classification modeling was built by using
J48 decision tree and multi layer perceptron ANN algorithms with 10-fold
cross-validation and splitting (70% training and 30% testing) techniques. Among
these models, a model which was built using J48 decision tree algorithm with
default 10-fold cross-validation outperforms 99.95% of overall accuracy rate;
while the classification accuracy of ANN is 99.71%. So decision tree has better
accuracy than ANN for classifying ERCA customers data.

 <dc:description>  Financial portfolio management is the process of constant redistribution of a
fund into different financial products. This paper presents a
financial-model-free Reinforcement Learning framework to provide a deep machine
learning solution to the portfolio management problem. The framework consists
of the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) topology, a
Portfolio-Vector Memory (PVM), an Online Stochastic Batch Learning (OSBL)
scheme, and a fully exploiting and explicit reward function. This framework is
realized in three instants in this work with a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and a Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM). They are, along with a number of recently reviewed or published
portfolio-selection strategies, examined in three back-test experiments with a
trading period of 30 minutes in a cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies are
electronic and decentralized alternatives to government-issued money, with
Bitcoin as the best-known example of a cryptocurrency. All three instances of
the framework monopolize the top three positions in all experiments,
outdistancing other compared trading algorithms. Although with a high
commission rate of 0.25% in the backtests, the framework is able to achieve at
least 4-fold returns in 50 days.

 <dc:description>  Success of Wikipedia would not be possible without the contributions of
millions of anonymous Internet users who edit articles, correct mistakes, add
links or pictures. At the same time Wikipedia editors are currently overworked
and there is always more tasks waiting to be completed than people willing to
volunteer. The paper explores the possibility of involving the elderly in the
Wikipedia editing process. Older adults were asked to complete various tasks on
Wikipedia. Based on the observations made during these activities as well as
in-depth interviews, a list of recommendation has been crafted. It turned out
that older adults are willing to contribute to Wikiepdia but substantial
changes have to be made in the Wikipedia editor.

 <dc:title>Compaction of Church Numerals for Higher-Order Compression</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this study, we address the problem of compacting Church numerals. Church
numerals appear as a representation of the repetitive part of data in
higher-order compression. We propose a novel decomposition scheme for a natural
number using tetration, which leads to a compact representation of
$\lambda$-terms equivalent to the original Church numerals. For natural number
$n$, we prove that the size of the $\lambda$-term obtained by the proposed
method is $O(({\rm slog}_{2}n)^{\log n/ \log \log n})$. Moreover, we
quantitatively confirmed experimentally that the proposed method outperforms a
binary expression of Church numerals when $n$ is less than approximately 10000.

 <dc:description>  The Barankin bound is generalized to the vector case in the mean square error
sense. Necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained to achieve the lower
bound. To obtain the result, a simple finite dimensional real vector valued
generalization of the Riesz representation theorem for Hilbert spaces is given.
The bound has the form of a linear matrix inequality where the covariances of
any unbiased estimator, if these exist, are lower bounded by matrices depending
only on the parametrized probability distributions.

 <dc:description>  Understanding of interaction between people and urban spaces is crucial for
inclusive decision making process. Smartphones and social media can be a rich
source of behavioral and declarative data about urban space, but it threatens
to exclude voice of older adults. The platform proposed in the paper attempts
to address this issue. A universal tagging mechanism based on the Pluchik Wheel
of Emotion is proposed. Usability of the platform was tested and prospect
studies are proposed.

 <dc:description>  The application of semantic technologies to content on the web is, in many
regards, important and urgent. Search engines, chatbots, intelligent personal
assistants and other technologies increasingly rely on content published as
semantic structured data. Yet, the process of creating this kind of data is
still complicated and widely unknown. The semantify.it platform implements an
approach to solve three of the most challenging question regarding the
publication of structured semantic data, namely: a) what vocabulary to use, b)
how to create annotation files and c) how to publish or integrate annotations
within a website without programming. This paper presents the idea and the
development of the semantify.it platform. It demonstrates that the creation
process of semantically annotated data does not have to be hard, shows use
cases and pilot users of the created software and presents where the
development of this platform or alike projects lead to in the future.

 <dc:description>  Semantic segmentation, like other fields of computer vision, has seen a
remarkable performance advance by the use of deep convolution neural networks.
However, considering that neighboring pixels are heavily dependent on each
other, both learning and testing of these methods have a lot of redundant
operations. To resolve this problem, the proposed network is trained and tested
with only 0.37% of total pixels by superpixel-based sampling and largely
reduced the complexity of upsampling calculation. The hypercolumn feature maps
are constructed by pyramid module in combination with the convolution layers of
the base network. Since the proposed method uses a very small number of sampled
pixels, the end-to-end learning of the entire network is difficult with a
common learning rate for all the layers. In order to resolve this problem, the
learning rate after sampling is controlled by statistical process control (SPC)
of gradients in each layer. The proposed method performs better than or equal
to the conventional methods that use much more samples on Pascal Context,
SUN-RGBD dataset.

 <dc:title>On the Effects of Distributed Electric Vehicle Network Utility
  Maximization in Low Voltage Feeders</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rivera, Jose</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The fast charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in distribution networks
requires real-time EV charging control to avoid the overloading of grid
components. Recent studies have proposed congestion control protocols, which
result from distributed optimization solutions of the Network Utility
Maximization (NUM) problem. While the NUM formulation allows the definition of
distributed computations with closed form solutions, its simple model does not
account for many of the feeders operational constraints. This puts the
resulting control algorithms effectiveness into question. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of implementing such algorithms for congestion control
in low voltage feeders. We review the latest NUM based algorithms for real-time
EV charging control, and evaluate their behavior and impact on the
comprehensive IEEE European Low Voltage Test Feeder. Our results show that the
EV NUM problem can effectively capture the relevant operational constraints, as
long as ampacity violations are the main bottleneck. Moreover, the results
demonstrate an advantage of the primal NUM solution over the more conventional
dual NUM solution in preventing a system overload.

 <dc:description>  Electronic payment protocols play a vital role in electronic commerce
security, which is essential for secure operation of electronic commerce
activities. Formal method is an effective way to verify the security of
protocols. But current formal method lacks the description and analysis of
timeliness in electronic payment protocols. In order to improve analysis
ability, a novel approach to analyze security properties such as
accountability, fairness and timeliness in electronic payment protocols is
proposed in this paper. This approach extends an existing logical method by
adding a concise time expression and analysis method. It enables to describe
the event time, and extends the time characteristics of logical inference
rules. We analyzed the Netbill protocol with the new approach and found that
the fairness of the protocol is not satisfied, due to timeliness problem. The
result illustrates the new approach is able to analyze the key properties of
electronic payment protocols. Furthermore, the new approach can be introduced
to analyze other time properties of cryptographic protocols.

 <dc:description>  Persistence diagrams have been widely recognized as a compact descriptor for
characterizing multiscale topological features in data. When many datasets are
available, statistical features embedded in those persistence diagrams can be
extracted by applying machine learnings. In particular, the ability for
explicitly analyzing the inverse in the original data space from those
statistical features of persistence diagrams is significantly important for
practical applications. In this paper, we propose a unified method for the
inverse analysis by combining linear machine learning models with persistence
images. The method is applied to point clouds and cubical sets, showing the
ability of the statistical inverse analysis and its advantages.

 <dc:description>  We present an analysis on optimizing performance of a single C++11 source
code using the Alpaka hardware abstraction library. For this we use the general
matrix multiplication (GEMM) algorithm in order to show that compilers can
optimize Alpaka code effectively when tuning key parameters of the algorithm.
We do not intend to rival existing, highly optimized DGEMM versions, but merely
choose this example to prove that Alpaka allows for platform-specific tuning
with a single source code. In addition we analyze the optimization potential
available with vendor-specific compilers when confronted with the heavily
templated abstractions of Alpaka. We specifically test the code for bleeding
edge architectures such as Nvidia's Tesla P100, Intel's Knights Landing (KNL)
and Haswell architecture as well as IBM's Power8 system. On some of these we
are able to reach almost 50\% of the peak floating point operation performance
using the aforementioned means. When adding compiler-specific #pragmas we are
able to reach 5 TFLOPS/s on a P100 and over 1 TFLOPS/s on a KNL system.

 <dc:description>  Given a string $S$, the \emph{compressed indexing problem} is to preprocess
$S$ into a compressed representation that supports fast \emph{substring
queries}. The goal is to use little space relative to the compressed size of
$S$ while supporting fast queries. We present a compressed index based on the
Lempel--Ziv 1977 compression scheme. We obtain the following time-space
trade-offs: For constant-sized alphabets; (i) $O(m + occ \lg\lg n)$ time using
$O(z\lg(n/z)\lg\lg z)$ space, or (ii) $O(m(1 + \frac{\lg^\epsilon z}{\lg(n/z)})
+ occ(\lg\lg n + \lg^\epsilon z))$ time using $O(z\lg(n/z))$ space. For integer
alphabets polynomially bounded by $n$; (iii) $O(m(1 + \frac{\lg^\epsilon
z}{\lg(n/z)}) + occ(\lg\lg n + \lg^\epsilon z))$ time using $O(z(\lg(n/z) +
\lg\lg z))$ space, or (iv) $O(m + occ(\lg\lg n + \lg^{\epsilon} z))$ time using
$O(z(\lg(n/z) + \lg^{\epsilon} z))$ space, where $n$ and $m$ are the length of
the input string and query string respectively, $z$ is the number of phrases in
the LZ77 parse of the input string, $occ$ is the number of occurrences of the
query in the input and $\epsilon &gt; 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant. In
particular, (i) improves the leading term in the query time of the previous
best solution from $O(m\lg m)$ to $O(m)$ at the cost of increasing the space by
a factor $\lg \lg z$. Alternatively, (ii) matches the previous best space
bound, but has a leading term in the query time of $O(m(1+\frac{\lg^{\epsilon}
z}{\lg (n/z)}))$. However, for any polynomial compression ratio, i.e., $z =
O(n^{1-\delta})$, for constant $\delta &gt; 0$, this becomes $O(m)$. Our index
also supports extraction of any substring of length $\ell$ in $O(\ell +
\lg(n/z))$ time. Technically, our results are obtained by novel extensions and
combinations of existing data structures of independent interest, including a
new batched variant of weak prefix search.

 <dc:description>  Entry-level crowd work is often reported to pay less than minimum wage. While
this may be appropriate or even necessary, due to various legal, economic, and
pragmatic factors, some Requesters and workers continue to question this status
quo. To promote further discussion on the issue, we survey Requesters and
workers whether they would support restricting tasks to require minimum wage
pay. As a form of design activism, we confronted workers with this dilemma
directly by posting a dummy Mechanical Turk task which told them that they
could not work on it because it paid less than their local minimum wage, and we
invited their feedback. Strikingly, for those workers expressing an opinion,
two-thirds of Indians favored the policy while two-thirds of Americans opposed
it. Though a majority of Requesters supported minimum wage pay, only 20\% would
enforce it. To further empower Requesters, and to ensure that effort or
ignorance are not barriers to change, we provide a simple public API to make it
easy to find a worker's local minimum wage by his/her IP address.

 <dc:description>  Blue Brain has pushed high-performance visualization (HPV) to complement its
HPC strategy since its inception in 2007. In 2011, this strategy has been
accelerated to develop innovative visualization solutions through increased
funding and strategic partnerships with other research institutions.
  We present the key elements of this HPV ecosystem, which integrates C++
visualization applications with novel collaborative display systems. We
motivate how our strategy of transforming visualization engines into services
enables a variety of use cases, not only for the integration with high-fidelity
displays, but also to build service oriented architectures, to link into web
applications and to provide remote services to Python applications.

 <dc:description>  Markov decision processes (MDPs) are the standard formalism for modelling
sequential decision making in stochastic environments. Policy synthesis
addresses the problem of how to control or limit the decisions an agent makes
so that a given specification is met. In this paper we consider PCTL*, the
probabilistic counterpart of CTL*, as the specification language. Because in
general the policy synthesis problem for PCTL* is undecidable, we restrict to
policies whose execution history memory is finitely bounded a priori.
  Surprisingly, no algorithm for policy synthesis for this natural and
expressive framework has been developed so far. We close this gap and describe
a tableau-based algorithm that, given an MDP and a PCTL* specification, derives
in a non-deterministic way a system of (possibly nonlinear) equalities and
inequalities. The solutions of this system, if any, describe the desired
(stochastic) policies.
  Our main result in this paper is the correctness of our method, i.e.,
soundness, completeness and termination.

 <dc:title>On Using Toeplitz and Circulant Matrices for Johnson-Lindenstrauss
  Transforms</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma is one of the corner stone results in
dimensionality reduction. It says that given $N$, for any set of $N$ vectors $X
\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a mapping $f : X \to \mathbb{R}^m$ such
that $f(X)$ preserves all pairwise distances between vectors in $X$ to within
$(1 \pm \varepsilon)$ if $m = O(\varepsilon^{-2} \lg N)$. Much effort has gone
into developing fast embedding algorithms, with the Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss
transform of Ailon and Chazelle being one of the most well-known techniques.
The current fastest algorithm that yields the optimal $m =
O(\varepsilon^{-2}\lg N)$ dimensions has an embedding time of $O(n \lg n +
\varepsilon^{-2} \lg^3 N)$. An exciting approach towards improving this, due to
Hinrichs and Vyb\'iral, is to use a random $m \times n$ Toeplitz matrix for the
embedding. Using Fast Fourier Transform, the embedding of a vector can then be
computed in $O(n \lg m)$ time. The big question is of course whether $m =
O(\varepsilon^{-2} \lg N)$ dimensions suffice for this technique. If so, this
would end a decades long quest to obtain faster and faster
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transforms. The current best analysis of the embedding of
Hinrichs and Vyb\'iral shows that $m = O(\varepsilon^{-2}\lg^2 N)$ dimensions
suffices. The main result of this paper, is a proof that this analysis
unfortunately cannot be tightened any further, i.e., there exists a set of $N$
vectors requiring $m = \Omega(\varepsilon^{-2} \lg^2 N)$ for the Toeplitz
approach to work.

 <dc:title>On the Complexity of Polytopes in $LI(2)$</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider polytopes given by systems of $n$ inequalities in
$d$ variables, where every inequality has at most two variables with nonzero
coefficient. We denote this family by $LI(2)$. We show that despite of the easy
algebraic structure, polytopes in $LI(2)$ can have high complexity. We
construct a polytope in $LI(2)$, whose number of vertices is almost the number
of vertices of the dual cyclic polytope, the difference is a multiplicative
factor of depending on $d$ and in particular independent of $n$. Moreover we
show that the dual cyclic polytope can not be realized in $LI(2)$.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new algorithm for recovery of belief network structure
from data handling hidden variables. It consists essentially in an extension of
the CI algorithm of Spirtes et al. by restricting the number of conditional
dependencies checked up to k variables and in an extension of the original CI
by additional steps transforming so called partial including path graph into a

 <dc:description>  Background: Performance bugs can lead to severe issues regarding computation
efficiency, power consumption, and user experience. Locating these bugs is a
difficult task because developers have to judge for every costly operation
whether runtime is consumed necessarily or unnecessarily. Objective: We wanted
to investigate how developers, when locating performance bugs, navigate through
the code, understand the program, and communicate the detected issues. Method:
We performed a qualitative user study observing twelve developers trying to fix
documented performance bugs in two open source projects. The developers worked
with a profiling and analysis tool that visually depicts runtime information in
a list representation and embedded into the source code view. Results: We
identified typical navigation strategies developers used for pinpointing the
bug, for instance, following method calls based on runtime consumption. The
integration of visualization and code helped developers to understand the bug.
Sketches visualizing data structures and algorithms turned out to be valuable
for externalizing and communicating the comprehension process for complex bugs.
Conclusion: Fixing a performance bug is a code comprehension and navigation
problem. Flexible navigation features based on executed methods and a close
integration of source code and performance information support the process.

 <dc:title>What Happens to Intentional Concepts in Requirements Engineering If

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  I assume in this paper that the proposition &quot;I cannot know your intentional
states&quot; is true. I consider its consequences on the use of so-called
&quot;intentional concepts&quot; for Requirements Engineering. I argue that if you take
this proposition to be true, then intentional concepts (e.g., goal, belief,
desire, intention, etc.) start to look less relevant (though not irrelevant),
despite being the focus of significant research attention over the past three
decades. I identify substantial problems that arise if you use instances of
intentional concepts to reflect intentional states. I sketch an approach to
address these problems. In it, intentional concepts have a less prominent role,
while notions of time, uncertainty, prediction, observability, evidence, and
learning are at the forefront.

 <dc:description>  Many different parametric models for video quality assessment have been
proposed in the past few years. This paper presents a review of nine recent
models which cover a wide range of methodologies and have been validated for
estimating video quality due to different degradation factors. Each model is
briefly described with key algorithms and relevant parametric formulas. The
generalization capability of each model to estimate video quality in
real-application scenarios is evaluated and compared with other models, using a
dataset created with video sequences from practical applications. These video
sequences cover a wide range of possible realistic encoding parameters, labeled
with mean opinion scores (MOS) via subjective test. The weakness and strength
of each model are remarked. Finally, future work towards a more general
parametric model that could apply for a wider range of applications is
discussed.

 <dc:description>  The challenge of sharing and communicating information is crucial in complex
human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. Ontologies and symbolic reasoning are
the state-of-the-art approaches for a natural representation of knowledge,
especially within the Semantic Web domain. In such a context, scripted
paradigms have been adopted to achieve high expressiveness. Nevertheless, since
symbolic reasoning is a high complexity problem, optimizing its performance
requires a careful design of the knowledge. Specifically, a robot architecture
requires the integration of several components implementing different behaviors
and generating a series of beliefs. Most of the components are expected to
access, manipulate, and reason upon a run-time generated semantic
representation of knowledge grounding robot behaviors and perceptions through
formal axioms, with soft real-time requirements.

 <dc:description>  We study parameterized Constraint Satisfaction Problem for infinite
constraint languages. The parameters that we study are weight of the satisfying
assignment, number of constraints, maximum number of occurrences of a variable
in the instance, and maximum number of occurrences of a variable in each
constraint. A dichotomy theorem is already known for finite constraint
languages with the weight parameter. We prove some general theorems that show,
as new results, that some well-known problems are fixed-parameter tractable and
some others are in W[1].

 <dc:description>  In this paper we investigate the behavioural differences between mobile phone
customers with prepaid and postpaid subscriptions. Our study reveals that (a)
postpaid customers are more active in terms of service usage and (b) there are
strong structural correlations in the mobile phone call network as connections
between customers of the same subscription type are much more frequent than
those between customers of different subscription types. Based on these
observations we provide methods to detect the subscription type of customers by
using information about their personal call statistics, and also their
egocentric networks simultaneously. The key of our first approach is to cast
this classification problem as a problem of graph labelling, which can be
solved by max-flow min-cut algorithms. Our experiments show that, by using both
user attributes and relationships, the proposed graph labelling approach is
able to achieve a classification accuracy of $\sim 87\%$, which outperforms by
$\sim 7\%$ supervised learning methods using only user attributes. In our
second problem we aim to infer the subscription type of customers of external
operators. We propose via approximate methods to solve this problem by using
node attributes, and a two-ways indirect inference method based on observed
homophilic structural correlations. Our results have straightforward
applications in behavioural prediction and personal marketing.

 <dc:description>  In millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, antenna architecture limitations make it
difficult to apply conventional fully digital precoding techniques but call for
low cost analog radio-frequency (RF) and digital baseband hybrid precoding
methods. This paper investigates joint RF-baseband hybrid precoding for the
downlink of multiuser multi-antenna mmWave systems with a limited number of RF
chains. Two performance measures, maximizing the spectral efficiency and the
energy efficiency of the system, are considered. We propose a codebook based RF
precoding design and obtain the channel state information via a beam sweep
procedure. Via the codebook based design, the original system is transformed
into a virtual multiuser downlink system with the RF chain constraint.
Consequently, we are able to simplify the complicated hybrid precoding
optimization problems to joint codeword selection and precoder design (JWSPD)
problems. Then, we propose efficient methods to address the JWSPD problems and
jointly optimize the RF and baseband precoders under the two performance
measures. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed hybrid precoders.

 <dc:title>A reliability-based approach for influence maximization using the

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The influence maximization is the problem of finding a set of social network
users, called influencers, that can trigger a large cascade of propagation.
Influencers are very beneficial to make a marketing campaign goes viral through
social networks for example. In this paper, we propose an influence measure
that combines many influence indicators. Besides, we consider the reliability
of each influence indicator and we present a distance-based process that allows
to estimate the reliability of each indicator. The proposed measure is defined
under the framework of the theory of belief functions. Furthermore, the
reliability-based influence measure is used with an influence maximization
model to select a set of users that are able to maximize the influence in the
network. Finally, we present a set of experiments on a dataset collected from
Twitter. These experiments show the performance of the proposed solution in
detecting social influencers with good quality.

 <dc:description>  The vertex coloring problem asks for the minimum number of colors that can be
assigned to the vertices of a given graph such that for all vertices v the
color of v is different from the color of any of its neighbors. The problem is
NP-hard. Here, we introduce new integer linear programming formulations based
on partial orderings. They have the advantage that they are as simple to work
with as the classical assignment formulation, since they can be fed directly
into a standard integer linear programming solver. We evaluate our new models
using Gurobi and show that our new simple approach is a good alternative to the
best state-of-the-art approaches for the vertex coloring problem. In our
computational experiments, we compare our formulations with the classical
assignment formulation and the representatives formulation on a large set of
benchmark graphs as well as randomly generated graphs of varying size and
density. The evaluation shows that one of the new models dominates both
formulations for sparse graphs, while the representatives formulation is the
best for dense graphs.

 <dc:description>  Neural IR models, such as DRMM and PACRR, have achieved strong results by
successfully capturing relevance matching signals. We argue that the context of
these matching signals is also important. Intuitively, when extracting,
modeling, and combining matching signals, one would like to consider the
surrounding text (local context) as well as other signals from the same
document that can contribute to the overall relevance score. In this work, we
highlight three potential shortcomings caused by not considering context
information and propose three neural ingredients to address them: a
disambiguation component, cascade k-max pooling, and a shuffling combination
layer. Incorporating these components into the PACRR model yields Co-PACRR, a
novel context-aware neural IR model. Extensive comparisons with established
models on Trec Web Track data confirm that the proposed model can achieve
superior search results. In addition, an ablation analysis is conducted to gain
insights into the impact of and interactions between different components. We
release our code to enable future comparisons.

convex position, what is the maximum number triangles one can create having
these points as vertices while avoiding certain sets of forbidden
configurations. As forbidden configurations we consider all 8 ways in which a
pair of triangles in such a point set can interact. This leads to 256 extremal
Tur\'an-type questions. We give nearly tight (within a $\log n$ factor) bounds
for 248 of these questions and show that the remaining 8 questions are all
asymptotically equivalent to Stein's longstanding tripod packing problem.

 <dc:description>  We study an agglomerative clustering problem motivated by interactive glyphs
in geo-visualization. Consider a set of disjoint square glyphs on an
interactive map. When the user zooms out, the glyphs grow in size relative to
the map, possibly with different speeds. When two glyphs intersect, we wish to
replace them by a new glyph that captures the information of the intersecting
glyphs.
  We present a fully dynamic kinetic data structure that maintains a set of $n$
disjoint growing squares. Our data structure uses $O(n (\log n \log\log n)^2)$
space, supports queries in worst case $O(\log^3 n)$ time, and updates in
$O(\log^7 n)$ amortized time. This leads to an $O(n\alpha(n)\log^7 n)$ time
algorithm to solve the agglomerative clustering problem. This is a significant
improvement over the current best $O(n^2)$ time algorithms.

 <dc:title>Improving Speech Related Facial Action Unit Recognition by Audiovisual

 <dc:description>  It is challenging to recognize facial action unit (AU) from spontaneous
facial displays, especially when they are accompanied by speech. The major
reason is that the information is extracted from a single source, i.e., the
visual channel, in the current practice. However, facial activity is highly
correlated with voice in natural human communications.
  Instead of solely improving visual observations, this paper presents a novel
audiovisual fusion framework, which makes the best use of visual and acoustic
cues in recognizing speech-related facial AUs. In particular, a dynamic
Bayesian network (DBN) is employed to explicitly model the semantic and dynamic
physiological relationships between AUs and phonemes as well as measurement
uncertainty. A pilot audiovisual AU-coded database has been collected to
evaluate the proposed framework, which consists of a &quot;clean&quot; subset containing
frontal faces under well controlled circumstances and a challenging subset with
large head movements and occlusions. Experiments on this database have
demonstrated that the proposed framework yields significant improvement in
recognizing speech-related AUs compared to the state-of-the-art visual-based
methods especially for those AUs whose visual observations are impaired during
speech, and more importantly also outperforms feature-level fusion methods by
explicitly modeling and exploiting physiological relationships between AUs and
phonemes.

values of a small number of input features) with our exhaustive rule-mining
algorithm, then constructs a new feature space based on the most relevant rules
called &quot;local features&quot; and finally, builds a local predictive model by
training a standard classifier on the new local feature space. This local
feature space is easy interpretable by providing a human-understandable
explanation under the explicit form of rules. Furthermore, our local predictive
approach is as powerful as global classical ones like logistic regression (LR),
support vector machine (SVM) and rules based methods like random forest (RF)
and gradient boosted tree (GBT).

 <dc:description>  Network creation games investigate complex networks from a game-theoretic
point of view. Based on the original model by Fabrikant et al. [PODC'03] many
variants have been introduced. However, almost all versions have the drawback
that edges are treated uniformly, i.e. every edge has the same cost and that
this common parameter heavily influences the outcomes and the analysis of these
games.
  We propose and analyze simple and natural parameter-free network creation
games with non-uniform edge cost. Our models are inspired by social networks
where the cost of forming a link is proportional to the popularity of the
targeted node. Besides results on the complexity of computing a best response
and on various properties of the sequential versions, we show that the most
general version of our model has constant Price of Anarchy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first proof of a constant Price of Anarchy for any
network creation game.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the downlink of a cache-enabled fog radio access network
(F-RAN) with limited fronthaul capacity, where user association (UA), data
delivery rate (DDR) and signal precoding are jointly optimized. We formulate a
mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem in which the weighted difference of
network throughput and total power consumption is maximized, subject to the
predefined DDR requirements and the maximum transmit power at each eRRH. To
address this challenging problem, we first apply the l0-norm approximation and
l1-norm minimization techniques to deal with the UA. After this key step, we
arrive at an approximated problem that only involves the joint optimization of
DDR and precoding. By using the alternating descent method, we further
decompose this problem into a convex subproblem for DDR allocation and a
nonconvex subproblem for precoding design. While the former is globally solved
by the interior-point method, the latter is solved by a specifically tailored
successive convex quadratic programming method. Finally, we propose an
iterative algorithm for the original joint optimization that is guaranteed to
converge. Importantly, each iteration of the developed algorithm only involves
solving simple convex problems. Numerical examples demonstrate that the
proposed design significantly improves both throughput and power performances,
especially in practical F-RANs with limited fronthaul capacity. Compared to the
sole precoder design for a given cache placement, our joint design is shown to
improve the throughput by 50% while saving at least half of the total power
consumption in the considered examples.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Cilleruelo, Luca, &amp; Baxter proved, for all bases b &gt;= 5, that every
natural number is the sum of at most 3 natural numbers whose base-b
representation is a palindrome. However, the cases b = 2, 3, 4 were left
unresolved.
  We prove, using a decision procedure based on automata, that every natural
number is the sum of at most 4 natural numbers whose base-2 representation is a
palindrome. Here the constant 4 is optimal. We obtain similar results for bases
3 and 4, thus completely resolving the problem.
  We consider some other variations on this problem, and prove similar results.
We argue that heavily case-based proofs are a good signal that a decision
procedure may help to automate the proof.

 <dc:description>  The goal of this tutorial is to introduce key models, algorithms, and open
questions related to the use of optimization methods for solving problems
arising in machine learning. It is written with an INFORMS audience in mind,
specifically those readers who are familiar with the basics of optimization
algorithms, but less familiar with machine learning. We begin by deriving a
formulation of a supervised learning problem and show how it leads to various
optimization problems, depending on the context and underlying assumptions. We
then discuss some of the distinctive features of these optimization problems,
focusing on the examples of logistic regression and the training of deep neural
networks. The latter half of the tutorial focuses on optimization algorithms,
first for convex logistic regression, for which we discuss the use of
first-order methods, the stochastic gradient method, variance reducing
stochastic methods, and second-order methods. Finally, we discuss how these
approaches can be employed to the training of deep neural networks, emphasizing
the difficulties that arise from the complex, nonconvex structure of these
models.

 <dc:description>  Consider a binary decision making process where a single machine learning
classifier replaces a multitude of humans. We raise questions about the
resulting loss of diversity in the decision making process. We study the
potential benefits of using random classifier ensembles instead of a single
classifier in the context of fairness-aware learning and demonstrate various
attractive properties: (i) an ensemble of fair classifiers is guaranteed to be
fair, for several different measures of fairness, (ii) an ensemble of unfair
classifiers can still achieve fair outcomes, and (iii) an ensemble of
classifiers can achieve better accuracy-fairness trade-offs than a single
classifier. Finally, we introduce notions of distributional fairness to
characterize further potential benefits of random classifier ensembles.

 <dc:description>  We consider load balancing in a network of caching servers delivering
contents to end users. Randomized load balancing via the so-called power of two
choices is a well-known approach in parallel and distributed systems. In this
framework, we investigate the tension between storage resources, communication
cost, and load balancing performance. To this end, we propose a randomized load
balancing scheme which simultaneously considers cache size limitation and
proximity in the server redirection process.
  In contrast to the classical power of two choices setup, since the memory
limitation and the proximity constraint cause correlation in the server
selection process, we may not benefit from the power of two choices. However,
we prove that in certain regimes of problem parameters, our scheme results in
the maximum load of order $\Theta(\log\log n)$ (here $n$ is the network size).
This is an exponential improvement compared to the scheme which assigns each
request to the nearest available replica. Interestingly, the extra
communication cost incurred by our proposed scheme, compared to the nearest
replica strategy, is small. Furthermore, our extensive simulations show that
the trade-off trend does not depend on the network topology and library
popularity profile details.

 <dc:title>Formation of Stable Strategic Networks with Desired Topologies</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many real-world networks such as social networks consist of strategic agents.
The topology of these networks often plays a crucial role in determining the
ease and speed with which certain information driven tasks can be accomplished.
Consequently, growing a stable network having a certain desired topology is of
interest. Motivated by this, we study the following important problem: given a
certain desired topology, under what conditions would best response link
alteration strategies adopted by strategic agents, uniquely lead to formation
of a stable network having the given topology. This problem is the inverse of
the classical network formation problem where we are concerned with determining
stable topologies, given the conditions on the network parameters. We study
this interesting inverse problem by proposing (1) a recursive model of network
formation and (2) a utility model that captures key determinants of network
formation. Building upon these models, we explore relevant topologies such as
star graph, complete graph, bipartite Turan graph, and multiple stars with
interconnected centers. We derive a set of sufficient conditions under which
these topologies uniquely emerge, study their social welfare properties, and
investigate the effects of deviating from the derived conditions.

 <dc:description>  Generally, the performance of a generic detector decreases significantly when
it is tested on a specific scene due to the large variation between the source
training dataset and the samples from the target scene. To solve this problem,
we propose a new formalism of transfer learning based on the theory of a
Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) filter to automatically specialize a
scene-specific Faster R-CNN detector. The suggested framework uses different
strategies based on the SMC filter steps to approximate iteratively the target
distribution as a set of samples in order to specialize the Faster R-CNN
detector towards a target scene. Moreover, we put forward a likelihood function
that combines spatio-temporal information extracted from the target video
sequence and the confidence-score given by the output layer of the Faster
R-CNN, to favor the selection of target samples associated with the right
label. The effectiveness of the suggested framework is demonstrated through
experiments on several public traffic datasets. Compared with the
state-of-the-art specialization frameworks, the proposed framework presents
encouraging results for both single and multi-traffic object detections.

 <dc:description>  Sensors (e.g., light, gyroscope, accelerotmeter) and sensing enabled
applications on a smart device make the applications more user-friendly and
efficient. However, the current permission-based sensor management systems of
smart devices only focus on certain sensors and any App can get access to other
sensors by just accessing the generic sensor API. In this way, attackers can
exploit these sensors in numerous ways: they can extract or leak users'
sensitive information, transfer malware, or record or steal sensitive
information from other nearby devices. In this paper, we propose 6thSense, a
context-aware intrusion detection system which enhances the security of smart
devices by observing changes in sensor data for different tasks of users and
creating a contextual model to distinguish benign and malicious behavior of
sensors. 6thSense utilizes three different Machine Learning-based detection
mechanisms (i.e., Markov Chain, Naive Bayes, and LMT) to detect malicious
behavior associated with sensors. We implemented 6thSense on a sensor-rich
Android smart device (i.e., smartphone) and collected data from typical daily
activities of 50 real users. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of
6thSense against three sensor-based threats: (1) a malicious App that can be
triggered via a sensor (e.g., light), (2) a malicious App that can leak
information via a sensor, and (3) a malicious App that can steal data using
sensors. Our extensive evaluations show that the 6thSense framework is an
effective and practical approach to defeat growing sensor-based threats with an
accuracy above 96% without compromising the normal functionality of the device.
Moreover, our framework costs minimal overhead.

 <dc:description>  We present a data structure that can maintain a simple planar graph under
edge contractions in linear total time. The data structure supports adjacency
queries and provides access to neighbor lists in $O(1)$ time. Moreover, it can
report all the arising self-loops and parallel edges.
  By applying the data structure, we can achieve optimal running times for
decremental bridge detection, 2-edge connectivity, maximal 3-edge connected
components, and the problem of finding a unique perfect matching for a static
planar graph. Furthermore, we improve the running times of algorithms for
several planar graph problems, including decremental 2-vertex and 3-edge
connectivity, and we show that using our data structure in a black-box manner,
one obtains conceptually simple optimal algorithms for computing MST and
5-coloring in planar graphs.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been applied to the task of
session-based recommendation. These approaches use RNNs to predict the next
item in a user session based on the previ- ously visited items. While some
approaches consider additional item properties, we argue that item dwell time
can be used as an implicit measure of user interest to improve session-based
item recommen- dations. We propose an extension to existing RNN approaches that
captures user dwell time in addition to the visited items and show that
recommendation performance can be improved. Additionally, we investigate the
usefulness of a single validation split for model selection in the case of
minor improvements and find that in our case the best model is not selected and
a fold-like study with different validation sets is necessary to ensure the
selection of the best model.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of learning the functions computing children from
parents in a Structural Causal Model once the underlying causal graph has been
identified. This is in some sense the second step after causal discovery.
Taking a probabilistic approach to estimating these functions, we derive a
natural myopic active learning scheme that identifies the intervention which is
optimally informative about all of the unknown functions jointly, given
previously observed data. We test the derived algorithms on simple examples, to
demonstrate that they produce a structured exploration policy that
significantly improves on unstructured base-lines.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning algorithms tend to create more accurate models with the
availability of large datasets. In some cases, highly accurate models can hide
the presence of bias in the data. There are several studies published that
tackle the development of discriminatory-aware machine learning algorithms. We
center on the further evaluation of machine learning models by doing error
analysis, to understand under what conditions the model is not working as
expected. We focus on the ethical implications of avoiding error analysis, from
a falsification of results and discrimination perspective. Finally, we show
different ways to approach error analysis in non-interpretable machine learning
algorithms such as deep learning.

 <dc:description>  It is widely observed that deep learning models with learned parameters
generalize well, even with much more model parameters than the number of
training samples. We systematically investigate the underlying reasons why deep
neural networks often generalize well, and reveal the difference between the
minima (with the same training error) that generalize well and those they
don't. We show that it is the characteristics the landscape of the loss
function that explains the good generalization capability. For the landscape of
loss function for deep networks, the volume of basin of attraction of good
minima dominates over that of poor minima, which guarantees optimization
methods with random initialization to converge to good minima. We theoretically
justify our findings through analyzing 2-layer neural networks; and show that
the low-complexity solutions have a small norm of Hessian matrix with respect
to model parameters. For deeper networks, extensive numerical evidence helps to
support our arguments.

 <dc:title>Bridging the Gap between Probabilistic and Deterministic Models: A
  Simulation Study on a Variational Bayes Predictive Coding Recurrent Neural

 <dc:description>  The current paper proposes a novel variational Bayes predictive coding RNN
model, which can learn to generate fluctuated temporal patterns from exemplars.
The model learns to maximize the lower bound of the weighted sum of the
regularization and reconstruction error terms. We examined how this weighting
can affect development of different types of information processing while
learning fluctuated temporal patterns. Simulation results show that strong
weighting of the reconstruction term causes the development of deterministic
chaos for imitating the randomness observed in target sequences, while strong
weighting of the regularization term causes the development of stochastic
dynamics imitating probabilistic processes observed in targets. Moreover,
results indicate that the most generalized learning emerges between these two
extremes. The paper concludes with implications in terms of the underlying
neuronal mechanisms for autism spectrum disorder and for free action.

 <dc:title>A selectional auto-encoder approach for document image binarization</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Binarization plays a key role in the automatic information retrieval from
document images. This process is usually performed in the first stages of
documents analysis systems, and serves as a basis for subsequent steps. Hence
it has to be robust in order to allow the full analysis workflow to be
successful. Several methods for document image binarization have been proposed
so far, most of which are based on hand-crafted image processing strategies.
Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks have shown an amazing performance in
many disparate duties related to computer vision. In this paper we discuss the
use of convolutional auto-encoders devoted to learning an end-to-end map from
an input image to its selectional output, in which activations indicate the
likelihood of pixels to be either foreground or background. Once trained,
documents can therefore be binarized by parsing them through the model and
applying a threshold. This approach has proven to outperform existing
binarization strategies in a number of document domains.

 <dc:description>  We derive tight and computable bounds on the bias of statistical estimators,
or more generally of quantities of interest, when evaluated on a baseline model
P rather than on the typically unknown true model Q. Our proposed method
combines the scalable information inequality derived by P. Dupuis, K.Chowdhary,
the authors and their collaborators together with classical concentration
inequalities (such as Bennett's and Hoeffding-Azuma inequalities). Our bounds
are expressed in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence R(Q||P) of model Q
with respect to P and the moment generating function for the statistical
estimator under P. Furthermore, concentration inequalities, i.e. bounds on
moment generating functions, provide tight and computationally inexpensive
model bias bounds for quantities of interest. Finally, they allow us to derive
rigorous confidence bands for statistical estimators that account for model
bias and are valid for an arbitrary amount of data.

 <dc:description>  Various aspects of color have been extensively studied in science and the
arts for the simple reason that it conveys information and attracts attention.
In perception, color plays an important role. It helps in tasks such as object
recognition. In humans, color perception starts with cones in the retina.
Studies in the primary visual cortex show opponent mechanisms for color
representation. While single-opponent cells encode local hue, double-opponent
neurons are sensitive to color boundaries. This paper introduces a biologically
plausible computational model for color representation. We present a
hierarchical model of neurons that successfully encodes local hue. Our proposed
model benefits from studies on the visual cortex and builds a network of
single-opponent and hue-selective neurons. We show that our model hue-selective
neurons, at the top layer of our network, can achieve the goal of local hue
encoding by combining inputs from single-opponent cells, and that they resemble
hue-selective neurons in V4 of the primate visual system. Moreover, with a few
examples, we present the possibility of spanning the infinite space of physical
hues from the hue-selective neurons in our model.

 <dc:description>  It is undeniable that the worldwide computer industry's center is the US,
specifically in Silicon Valley. Much of the reason for the success of Silicon
Valley had to do with Moore's Law: the observation by Intel co-founder Gordon
Moore that the number of transistors on a microchip doubled at a rate of
approximately every two years. According to the International Technology
Roadmap for Semiconductors, Moore's Law will end in 2021. How can we rethink
computing technology to restart the historic explosive performance growth?
Since 2012, the IEEE Rebooting Computing Initiative (IEEE RCI) has been working
with industry and the US government to find new computing approaches to answer
this question. In parallel, the CCC has held a number of workshops addressing
similar questions. This whitepaper summarizes some of the IEEE RCI and CCC
findings. The challenge for the US is to lead this new era of computing. Our
international competitors are not sitting still: China has invested
significantly in a variety of approaches such as neuromorphic computing, chip
fabrication facilities, computer architecture, and high-performance simulation
and data analytics computing, for example. We must act now, otherwise, the
center of the computer industry will move from Silicon Valley and likely move
off shore entirely.

 <dc:description>  Inference using deep neural networks is often outsourced to the cloud since
it is a computationally demanding task. However, this raises a fundamental
issue of trust. How can a client be sure that the cloud has performed inference
correctly? A lazy cloud provider might use a simpler but less accurate model to
reduce its own computational load, or worse, maliciously modify the inference
results sent to the client. We propose SafetyNets, a framework that enables an
untrusted server (the cloud) to provide a client with a short mathematical
proof of the correctness of inference tasks that they perform on behalf of the
client. Specifically, SafetyNets develops and implements a specialized
interactive proof (IP) protocol for verifiable execution of a class of deep
neural networks, i.e., those that can be represented as arithmetic circuits.
Our empirical results on three- and four-layer deep neural networks demonstrate
the run-time costs of SafetyNets for both the client and server are low.
SafetyNets detects any incorrect computations of the neural network by the
untrusted server with high probability, while achieving state-of-the-art
accuracy on the MNIST digit recognition (99.4%) and TIMIT speech recognition
tasks (75.22%).

 <dc:description>  We present a formalization of convex polyhedra in the proof assistant Coq.
The cornerstone of our work is a complete implementation of the simplex method,
together with the proof of its correctness and termination. This allows us to
define the basic predicates over polyhedra in an effective way (i.e. as
programs), and relate them with the corresponding usual logical counterparts.
To this end, we make an extensive use of the Boolean reflection methodology.
The benefit of this approach is that we can easily derive the proof of several
essential results on polyhedra, such as Farkas Lemma, duality theorem of linear
programming, and Minkowski Theorem.

 <dc:description>  An important long-term goal in machine learning systems is to build learning
agents that, like humans, can learn many tasks over their lifetime, and
moreover use information from these tasks to improve their ability to do so
efficiently. In this work, our goal is to provide new theoretical insights into
the potential of this paradigm. In particular, we propose a lifelong learning
framework that adheres to a novel notion of resource efficiency that is
critical in many real-world domains where feature evaluations are costly. That
is, our learner aims to reuse information from previously learned related tasks
to learn future tasks in a feature-efficient manner. Furthermore, we consider
novel combinatorial ways in which learning tasks can relate. Specifically, we
design lifelong learning algorithms for two structurally different and widely
used families of target functions: decision trees/lists and
monomials/polynomials. We also provide strong feature-efficiency guarantees for
these algorithms; in fact, we show that in order to learn future targets, we
need only slightly more feature evaluations per training example than what is
needed to predict on an arbitrary example using those targets. We also provide
algorithms with guarantees in an agnostic model where not all the targets are
related to each other. Finally, we also provide lower bounds on the performance
of a lifelong learner in these models, which are in fact tight under some
conditions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Administrative Role Based Access Control (ARBAC) models specify how to manage
user-role assignments (URA), permission-role assignments (PRA), and role-role
assignments (RRA). Many approaches have been proposed in the literature for
URA, PRA, and RRA. In this paper, we propose a model for attribute-based
role-role assignment (ARRA), a novel way to unify prior RRA approaches. We
leverage the idea that attributes of various RBAC entities such as admin users
and regular roles can be used to administer RRA in a highly flexible manner. We
demonstrate that ARRA can express and unify prior RRA models.

 <dc:title>Signal Reconstruction from Interferometric Measurements under Sensing

 <dc:description>  This paper develops a unifying framework for signal reconstruction from
interferometric measurements that is broadly applicable to various applications
of interferometry. In this framework, the problem of signal reconstruction in
interferometry amounts to one of basis analysis. Its applicability is shown to
extend beyond conventional temporal interferometry, which leverages the
relative delay between the two arms of an interferometer, to arbitrary degrees
of freedom of the input signal. This allows for reconstruction of signals
supported in other domains (e.g., spatial) with no modification to the
underlying structure except for replacing the standard temporal delay with a
generalized delay, that is, a practically realizable unitary transformation for
which the basis elements are eigenfunctions. Under the proposed model, the
interferometric measurements are shown to be linear in the basis coefficients,
thereby enabling efficient and fast recovery of the desired information. While
the corresponding linear transformation has only a limited number of degrees of
freedom set by the structure of the interferometer giving rise to a highly
constrained sensing structure, we show that the problem of signal recovery from
such measurements can still be carried out compressively. This signifies
significant reduction in sample complexity without introducing any additional
randomization as is typically done in prior work leveraging compressive sensing
techniques. We provide performance guarantees under constrained sensing by
proving that the transformation satisfies sufficient conditions for successful
reconstruction of sparse signals using concentration arguments. We showcase the
effectiveness of the proposed approach using simulation results, as well as
actual experimental results in the context of optical modal analysis of spatial
beams.

 <dc:description>  Sensitive information is present on our phones, disks, watches and computers.
Its protection is essential. Plausible deniability of stored data allows
individuals to deny that their device contains a piece of sensitive
information. This constitutes a key tool in the fight against oppressive
governments and censorship. Unfortunately, existing solutions, such as the now
defunct TrueCrypt, can defend only against an adversary that can access a users
device at most once (single-snapshot adversary). Recent solutions have traded
significant performance overheads for the ability to handle more powerful
adversaries, that are able to access the device at multiple points in time
(multi-snapshot adversary). In this paper we show that this sacrifice is not
necessary. We introduce and build DataLair, a practical plausible deniability
mechanism. When compared with existing approaches, DataLair is two orders of
magnitude faster for public data accesses, and 5 times faster for hidden data
accesses. An important component in DataLair is a new write-only ORAM
construction which improves on the complexity of the state of the art
write-only ORAM by a factor of O(logN ), where N denotes the underlying storage
disk size.

 <dc:description>  Vectors of data are at the heart of machine learning and data mining.
Recently, vector quantization methods have shown great promise in reducing both
the time and space costs of operating on vectors. We introduce a vector
quantization algorithm that can compress vectors over 12x faster than existing
techniques while also accelerating approximate vector operations such as
distance and dot product computations by up to 10x. Because it can encode over
2GB of vectors per second, it makes vector quantization cheap enough to employ
in many more circumstances. For example, using our technique to compute
approximate dot products in a nested loop can multiply matrices faster than a
state-of-the-art BLAS implementation, even when our algorithm must first
compress the matrices.
  In addition to showing the above speedups, we demonstrate that our approach
can accelerate nearest neighbor search and maximum inner product search by over
100x compared to floating point operations and up to 10x compared to other
vector quantization methods. Our approximate Euclidean distance and dot product
computations are not only faster than those of related algorithms with slower
encodings, but also faster than Hamming distance computations, which have
direct hardware support on the tested platforms. We also assess the errors of
our algorithm's approximate distances and dot products, and find that it is
competitive with existing, slower vector quantization algorithms.

 <dc:title>Cache Oblivious Algorithms for Computing the Triplet Distance Between

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of computing the triplet distance between two rooted
unordered trees with $n$ labeled leafs. Introduced by Dobson 1975, the triplet
distance is the number of leaf triples that induce different topologies in the
two trees. The current theoretically best algorithm is an $\mathrm{O}(n \log
n)$ time algorithm by Brodal et al. (SODA 2013). Recently Jansson et al.
proposed a new algorithm that, while slower in theory, requiring $\mathrm{O}(n
\log^3 n)$ time, in practice it outperforms the theoretically faster
$\mathrm{O}(n \log n)$ algorithm. Both algorithms do not scale to external
memory. We present two cache oblivious algorithms that combine the best of both
worlds. The first algorithm is for the case when the two input trees are binary
trees and the second a generalized algorithm for two input trees of arbitrary
degree. Analyzed in the RAM model, both algorithms require $\mathrm{O}(n \log
n)$ time, and in the cache oblivious model $\mathrm{O}(\frac{n}{B} \log_{2}
\frac{n}{M})$ I/Os. Their relative simplicity and the fact that they scale to
external memory makes them achieve the best practical performance. We note that
these are the first algorithms that scale to external memory, both in theory
and practice, for this problem.

 <dc:description>  In emergency patient transport from rural medical facility to center tertiary
hospital, real-time monitoring of the patient in the ambulance by a physician
expert at the tertiary center is crucial. While telemetry healthcare services
using mobile networks may enable remote real-time monitoring of transported
patients, physiologic measures and tracking are at least as important and
requires the existence of high-fidelity communication coverage. However, the
wireless networks along the roads especially in rural areas can range from 4G
to low-speed 2G, some parts with communication breakage. From a patient care
perspective, transport during critical illness can make route selection patient
state dependent. Prompt decisions with the relative advantage of a longer more
secure bandwidth route versus a shorter, more rapid transport route but with
less secure bandwidth must be made. The trade-off between route selection and
the quality of wireless communication is an important optimization problem
which unfortunately has remained unaddressed by prior work.
  In this paper, we propose a novel physiology-aware route scheduling approach
for emergency ambulance transport of rural patients with acute, high risk
diseases in need of continuous remote monitoring. We mathematically model the
problem into an NP-hard graph theory problem, and approximate a solution based
on a trade-off between communication coverage and shortest path. We profile
communication along two major routes in a large rural hospital settings in
Illinois, and use the traces to manifest the concept. Further, we design our
algorithms and run preliminary experiments for scalability analysis. We believe
that our scheduling techniques can become a compelling aid that enables an
always-connected remote monitoring system in emergency patient transfer
scenarios aimed to prevent morbidity and mortality with early diagnosis
treatment.

 <dc:description>  The classical Kaczmarz iteration and its randomized variants are popular
tools for fast inversion of linear overdetermined systems. This method extends
naturally to the setting of the phase retrieval problem via substituting at
each iteration the phase of any measurement of the available approximate
solution for the unknown phase of the measurement of the true solution. Despite
the simplicity of the method, rigorous convergence guarantees that are
available for the classical linear setting have not been established so far for
the phase retrieval setting. In this short note, we provide a convergence
result for the randomized Kaczmarz method for phase retrieval in
$\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that with high probability a random measurement system
of size $m \asymp d$ will be admissible for this method in the sense that
convergence in the mean square sense is guaranteed with any prescribed
probability. The convergence is exponential and comparable to the linear
setting.

 <dc:description>  We introduce and investigate *targeting adversaries* who selectively attack
users of Tor or other secure-communication networks. We argue that attacks by
such adversaries are more realistic and more significant threats to those most
relying on Tor's protection than are attacks in prior analyses of Tor security.
Previous research and Tor design decisions have focused on protecting against
adversaries who are equally interested in any user of the network. Our
adversaries selectively target users---e.g., those who visit a particular
website or chat on a particular private channel---and essentially disregard Tor
users other than these. We present a model of such adversaries and investigate
three example cases where particular users might be targeted: a cabal
conducting meetings using MTor, a published Tor multicast protocol; a cabal
meeting on a private IRC channel; and users visiting a particular .onion
website. In general for our adversaries, compromise is much faster and provides
more feedback and possibilities for adaptation than do attacks examined in
prior work. We also discuss selection of websites for targeting of their users
based on the distribution across users of site activity. We describe
adversaries both attempting to learn the size of a cabal meeting online or of a
set of sufficiently active visitors to a targeted site and attempting to
identify guards of each targeted user. We compare the threat of targeting
adversaries versus previously considered adversaries, and we briefly sketch
possible countermeasures for resisting targeting adversaries.

 <dc:description>  We introduce NoisyNet, a deep reinforcement learning agent with parametric
noise added to its weights, and show that the induced stochasticity of the
agent's policy can be used to aid efficient exploration. The parameters of the
noise are learned with gradient descent along with the remaining network
weights. NoisyNet is straightforward to implement and adds little computational
overhead. We find that replacing the conventional exploration heuristics for
A3C, DQN and dueling agents (entropy reward and $\epsilon$-greedy respectively)
with NoisyNet yields substantially higher scores for a wide range of Atari
games, in some cases advancing the agent from sub to super-human performance.

 <dc:description>  Visually comparing brain networks, or connectomes, is an essential task in
the field of neuroscience. Especially relevant to the field of clinical
neuroscience, group studies that examine differences between populations or
changes over time within a population enable neuroscientists to reason about
effective diagnoses and treatments for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders.
In this paper, we specifically explore how visual analytics tools can be used
to facilitate various clinical neuroscience tasks, in which observation and
analysis of meaningful patterns in the connectome can support patient diagnosis
and treatment. We conduct a survey of visualization tasks that enable clinical
neuroscience activities, and further explore how existing connectome
visualization tools support or fail to support these tasks. Based on our
investigation of these tasks, we introduce a novel visualization tool,
NeuroCave, to support group studies analyses. We discuss how our design
decisions (the use of immersive visualization, the use of hierarchical
clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques, and the choice of visual
encodings) are motivated by these tasks. We evaluate NeuroCave through two use
cases that illustrate the utility of interactive connectome visualization in
clinical neuroscience contexts. In the first use case, we study sex differences
using functional connectomes and discover hidden connectome patterns associated
with well-known cognitive differences in spatial and verbal abilities. In the
second use case, we show how the utility of visualizing the brain in different
topological space coupled with clustering information can reveal the brain's
intrinsic structure.

 <dc:description>  The adoption of automated, data-driven decision making in an ever expanding
range of applications has raised concerns about its potential unfairness
towards certain social groups. In this context, a number of recent studies have
focused on defining, detecting, and removing unfairness from data-driven
decision systems. However, the existing notions of fairness, based on parity
(equality) in treatment or outcomes for different social groups, tend to be
quite stringent, limiting the overall decision making accuracy. In this paper,
we draw inspiration from the fair-division and envy-freeness literature in
economics and game theory and propose preference-based notions of fairness --
given the choice between various sets of decision treatments or outcomes, any
group of users would collectively prefer its treatment or outcomes, regardless
of the (dis)parity as compared to the other groups. Then, we introduce
tractable proxies to design margin-based classifiers that satisfy these
preference-based notions of fairness. Finally, we experiment with a variety of
synthetic and real-world datasets and show that preference-based fairness
allows for greater decision accuracy than parity-based fairness.

 <dc:description>  We present a structure-aware code editor, called Deuce, that is equipped with
direct manipulation capabilities for automating structured program
transformations. Compared to most typical refactoring environments, Deuce
employs a direct manipulation interface that is tightly integrated within a
text-based editing workflow. In particular, Deuce draws (i) clickable widgets
atop the source code that correspond to subexpressions and other relevant
features of the program structure, and (ii) a lightweight, interactive display
of potential transformations based on the current selections. With these
features, the user can quickly and easily identify, invoke, and configure
various structured program transformations during the text-editing process. We
implement Deuce and evaluate the resulting workflow within the context of
Sketch-n-Sketch, an interactive functional programming environment for
generating Scalable Vector Graphics. Through a series of examples, we
demonstrate how the automated transformations in Deuce help reduce the amount
of tedious and error-prone text-edits that arise in several programming tasks.

 <dc:description>  As the driving force of crowdsourcing is the interaction among participants,
various incentive mechanisms have been proposed to attract sufficient
participants. However, the existing works assume that all the providers always
meet the deadline and the task value accordingly remains constant. To bridge
the gap of such impractical assumption, we model the heterogeneous punctuality
behavior of providers and the task value depreciation of requesters. Based on
those models, we propose an Expected Social Welfare Maximizing (ESWM) mechanism
that aims to maximize the expected social welfare in polynomial time.
Simulation results show that our heuristic-based mechanism achieves higher
expected social welfare and platform utility via attracting more participants.

 <dc:description>  We present the formalization of a theory of syntax with bindings that has
been developed and refined over the last decade to support several large
formalization efforts. Terms are defined for an arbitrary number of
constructors of varying numbers of inputs, quotiented to alpha-equivalence and
sorted according to a binding signature. The theory includes a rich collection
of properties of the standard operators on terms, such as substitution and
freshness. It also includes induction and recursion principles and support for
semantic interpretation, all tailored for smooth interaction with the bindings
and the standard operators.

attempt to establish a comprehensive and sustainable ICT-based solution for
empowerment of elderly communities towards better urban participation of
seniors. We report on our various endeavors for better involvement and
participation of older adults in urban life by lowering ICT barriers,
encouraging social inclusion, intergenerational interaction, physical activity
and engaging older adults in the process of development of ICT solutions. We
report on a model and assumptions of the LivingLab PJAIT as well as a number of
activities created and implemented for LivingLab participants: from ICT
courses, both traditional and e-learning, through on-line crowdsourcing tasks,
to blended activities of different forms and complexity. We also provide
conclusions on the lessons learned in the process and some future plans,
including solutions for better senior urban participation and citizen science.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Large-scale distributed computing systems face two major bottlenecks that
limit their scalability: straggler delay caused by the variability of
computation times at different worker nodes and communication bottlenecks
caused by shuffling data across many nodes in the network. Recently, it has
been shown that codes can provide significant gains in overcoming these
bottlenecks. In particular, optimal coding schemes for minimizing latency in
distributed computation of linear functions and mitigating the effect of
stragglers was proposed for a wired network, where the workers can
simultaneously transmit messages to a master node without interference. In this
paper, we focus on the problem of coded computation over a wireless
master-worker setup with straggling workers, where only one worker can transmit
the result of its local computation back to the master at a time. We consider 3
asymptotic regimes (determined by how the communication and computation times
are scaled with the number of workers) and precisely characterize the total
run-time of the distributed algorithm and optimum coding strategy in each
regime. In particular, for the regime of practical interest where the
computation and communication times of the distributed computing algorithm are
comparable, we show that the total run-time approaches a simple lower bound
that decouples computation and communication, and demonstrate that coded
schemes are $\Theta(\log(n))$ times faster than uncoded schemes.

 <dc:description>  We present a regularization-inspired approach for reducing bias in learned
classifiers. In particular, we focus on binary classification tasks over
individuals from two populations, where, as our criterion for fairness, we wish
to achieve similar false positive rates in both populations, and similar false
negative rates in both populations. As a proof of concept, we implement our
approach and empirically evaluate its ability to achieve both fairness and
accuracy, using the COMPAS scores data for prediction of recidivism.

 <dc:description>  Complex statistical machine learning models are increasingly being used or
considered for use in high-stakes decision-making pipelines in domains such as
financial services, health care, criminal justice and human services. These
models are often investigated as possible improvements over more classical
tools such as regression models or human judgement. While the modeling approach
may be new, the practice of using some form of risk assessment to inform
decisions is not. When determining whether a new model should be adopted, it is
therefore essential to be able to compare the proposed model to the existing
approach across a range of task-relevant accuracy and fairness metrics. Looking
at overall performance metrics, however, may be misleading. Even when two
models have comparable overall performance, they may nevertheless disagree in
their classifications on a considerable fraction of cases. In this paper we
introduce a model comparison framework for automatically identifying subgroups
in which the differences between models are most pronounced. Our primary focus
is on identifying subgroups where the models differ in terms of
fairness-related quantities such as racial or gender disparities. We present
experimental results from a recidivism prediction task and a hypothetical
lending example.

 <dc:description>  One of the major open challenges in self-driving cars is the ability to
detect cars and pedestrians to safely navigate in the world. Deep
learning-based object detector approaches have enabled great advances in using
camera imagery to detect and classify objects. But for a safety critical
application such as autonomous driving, the error rates of the current
state-of-the-art are still too high to enable safe operation. Moreover, our
characterization of object detector performance is primarily limited to testing
on prerecorded datasets. Errors that occur on novel data go undetected without
additional human labels. In this paper, we propose an automated method to
identify mistakes made by object detectors without ground truth labels. We show
that inconsistencies in object detector output between a pair of similar images
can be used to identify false negatives(e.g. missed detections). In particular,
we study two distinct cues - temporal and stereo inconsistencies - using data
that is readily available on most autonomous vehicles. Our method can be used
with any camera-based object detector and we evaluate the technique on several
sets of real world data. The proposed method achieves over 97% precision in
automatically identifying missed detections produced by one of the leading
state-of-the-art object detectors in the literature. We also release a new
tracking dataset with over 100 sequences totaling more than 80,000 labeled
images from a game engine to facilitate further research.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we derive upper bounds on the cardinality of tandem duplication
and palindromic deletion correcting codes by deriving the generalized sphere
packing bound for these error types. We first prove that an upper bound for
tandem deletions is also an upper bound for inserting the respective type of
duplications. Therefore, we derive the bounds based on these special deletions
as this results in tighter bounds. We determine the spheres for tandem and
palindromic duplications/deletions and the number of words with a specific
sphere size. Our upper bounds on the cardinality directly imply lower bounds on
the redundancy which we compare with the redundancy of the best known
construction correcting arbitrary burst errors. Our results indicate that the
correction of palindromic duplications requires more redundancy than the
correction of tandem duplications. Further, there is a significant gap between
the minimum redundancy of duplication correcting codes and burst insertion
correcting codes.

 <dc:description>  Despite the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) especially
in image classification tasks, the effect of convolution features on learned
representations is still limited. It mostly focuses on the salient object of
the images, but ignores the variation information on clutter and local. In this
paper, we propose a special framework, which is the multiple VLAD encoding
method with the CNNs features for image classification. Furthermore, in order
to improve the performance of the VLAD coding method, we explore the
multiplicity of VLAD encoding with the extension of three kinds of encoding
algorithms, which are the VLAD-SA method, the VLAD-LSA and the VLAD-LLC method.
Finally, we equip the spatial pyramid patch (SPM) on VLAD encoding to add the
spatial information of CNNs feature. In particular, the power of SPM leads our
framework to yield better performance compared to the existing method.

 <dc:creator>Jain, Viren</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Volumetric (3d) images are acquired for many scientific and biomedical
purposes using imaging methods such as serial section microscopy, CT scans, and
MRI. A frequent step in the analysis and reconstruction of such data is the
alignment and registration of images that were acquired in succession along a
spatial or temporal dimension. For example, in serial section electron
microscopy, individual 2d sections are imaged via electron microscopy and then
must be aligned to one another in order to produce a coherent 3d volume. State
of the art approaches find image correspondences derived from patch matching
and invariant feature detectors, and then solve optimization problems that
rigidly or elastically deform series of images into an aligned volume. Here we
show how fully convolutional neural networks trained with an adversarial loss
function can be used for two tasks: (1) synthesis of missing or damaged image
data from adjacent sections, and (2) fine-scale alignment of block-face
electron microscopy data. Finally, we show how these two capabilities can be
combined in order to produce artificial isotropic volumes from anisotropic
image volumes using a super-resolution adversarial alignment and interpolation
approach.

 <dc:description>  The task of MRI fingerprinting is to identify tissue parameters from
complex-valued MRI signals. The prevalent approach is dictionary based, where a
test MRI signal is compared to stored MRI signals with known tissue parameters
and the most similar signals and tissue parameters retrieved. Such an approach
does not scale with the number of parameters and is rather slow when the tissue
parameter space is large.
  Our first novel contribution is to use deep learning as an efficient
nonlinear inverse mapping approach. We generate synthetic (tissue, MRI) data
from an MRI simulator, and use them to train a deep net to map the MRI signal
to the tissue parameters directly.
  Our second novel contribution is to develop a complex-valued neural network
with new cardioid activation functions. Our results demonstrate that
complex-valued neural nets could be much more accurate than real-valued neural
nets at complex-valued MRI fingerprinting.

 <dc:title>Achieving Efficient and Provably Secure Steganography in Practice</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alston, Aubrey</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Steganography is the task of concealing a message within a medium such that
the presence of the hidden message cannot be detected. Though the prospect of
steganography is conceivably interesting in many contexts, and though work has
been done both towards formalizing steganographic security and providing
provably secure constructions, little work exists attempting to provide
efficient and provably secure steganographic schemes in specific, useful
domains. Beginning from the starting point of the initial definition of
steganographic security, I have engaged in an exploration which has developed
to include two primary tasks, both pointing towards the realization of
efficient and secure steganographic systems in practice: (a) investigating the
syntactic and semantic applicability of the current formalism of steganographic
security to a broader range of potentially interesting domains and (b)
constructing and implementing provably secure (symmetric-key) steganographic
schemes in domains which are well-suited to the current formalism.

 <dc:title>Data Decisions and Theoretical Implications when Adversarially Learning

 <dc:description>  How can we learn a classifier that is &quot;fair&quot; for a protected or sensitive
group, when we do not know if the input to the classifier belongs to the
protected group? How can we train such a classifier when data on the protected
group is difficult to attain? In many settings, finding out the sensitive input
attribute can be prohibitively expensive even during model training, and
sometimes impossible during model serving. For example, in recommender systems,
if we want to predict if a user will click on a given recommendation, we often
do not know many attributes of the user, e.g., race or age, and many attributes
of the content are hard to determine, e.g., the language or topic. Thus, it is
not feasible to use a different classifier calibrated based on knowledge of the
sensitive attribute.
  Here, we use an adversarial training procedure to remove information about
the sensitive attribute from the latent representation learned by a neural
network. In particular, we study how the choice of data for the adversarial
training effects the resulting fairness properties. We find two interesting
results: a small amount of data is needed to train these adversarial models,
and the data distribution empirically drives the adversary's notion of
fairness.

 <dc:title>A Steganographic Design Paradigm for General Steganographic Objectives</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alston, Aubrey</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Steganography is the task of concealing a message within a medium such that
the presence of the hidden message cannot be detected. Beyond the standard
scope of private-key steganography, steganography is also potentially
interesting from other perspectives; for example, the prospect of
steganographic parallels to components in public-key cryptography is
particularly interesting. In this project, I begin with an exploration of
public-key steganography, and I continue by condensing existing work into a
unifying design paradigm that (a) admits provably secret public- and
private-key constructions and (b) provides for a conceptual decoupling of
channel considerations and steganographic goals, ultimately implying both
universal constructions and constructions with channel-specific optimizations.
  This work is by-and-large a survey of applications of this paradigm:
specifically, I use the framework to achieve provably secure distributed
steganography, obtain new public-key steganographic constructions using
alternative assumptions, and give discussion of channel-specific optimizations
allowed by cryptography as a channel and natural language channels and
challenges facing practical deployment of steganographic systems at scale.

 <dc:title>On the Cryptanalysis via Approximation of Cryptographic Primitives
  Relying on the Planted Clique Conjecture</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alston, Aubrey</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  While the reliable use of some NP-complete problem in tandem with the
assumption that P is not equal to NP has eluded cryptographers due to lack of
results showing average-case hardness, one alternative which has been explored
is reliance on assumptions that solving certain NP-hard optimization problems
within some degree of accuracy is computationally difficult in specific
instance classes. In this work, we explore one such example of this effort
which attempts to provide cryptographic primitives by relying on the planted
clique conjecture. More specifically, we (1) present this construction in
summary, (2) propose a simple cryptanalytic method using only approximation
algorithms, and (3) consider the feasibility of such cryptanalysis in the
context of existing approximation algorithms for the maximum clique problem. We
ultimately find that recent advances in the area of combinatoric approximation
algorithms fatally hinders the prospect of any serious application of existing
candidate constructions based upon the planted clique conjecture.

 <dc:title>Synthetic Data for Neural Machine Translation of Spoken-Dialects</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to generate synthetic data for
training Neural Machine Translation systems. The proposed approach transforms a
given parallel corpus between a written language and a target language to a
parallel corpus between a spoken dialect variant and the target language. Our
approach is language independent and can be used to generate data for any
variant of the source language such as slang or spoken dialect or even for a
different language that is closely related to the source language.
  The proposed approach is based on local embedding projection of distributed
representations which utilizes monolingual embeddings to transform parallel
data across language variants. We report experimental results on Levantine to
English translation using Neural Machine Translation. We show that the
generated data can improve a very large scale system by more than 2.8 Bleu
points using synthetic spoken data which shows that it can be used to provide a
reliable translation system for a spoken dialect that does not have sufficient
parallel data.

 <dc:title>Corpus-compressed Streaming and the Spotify Problem</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alston, Aubrey</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we describe a problem which we refer to as the \textbf{Spotify
problem} and explore a potential solution in the form of what we call
corpus-compressed streaming schemes.
  Inspired by the problem of constrained bandwidth during use of the popular
Spotify application on mobile networks, the Spotify problem applies in any
number of practical domains where devices may be periodically expected to
experience degraded communication or storage capacity. One obvious solution
candidate which comes to mind immediately is standard compression. Though
obviously applicable, standard compression does not in any way exploit all
characteristics of the problem; in particular, standard compression is
oblivious to the fact that a decoder has a period of virtually unrestrained
communication. Towards applying compression in a manner which attempts to
stretch the benefit of periods of higher communication capacity into periods of
restricted capacity, we introduce as a solution the idea of a corpus-compressed
streaming scheme.
  This report begins with a formal definition of a corpus-compressed streaming
scheme. Following a discussion of how such schemes apply to the Spotify
problem, we then give a survey of specific corpus-compressed scheming schemes
guided by an exploration of different measures of description complexity within
the Chomsky hierarchy of languages.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we perform an exploratory study on synthesizing deep neural
networks using biological synaptic strength distributions, and the potential
influence of different distributions on modelling performance particularly for
the scenario associated with small data sets. Surprisingly, a CNN with
convolutional layer synaptic strengths drawn from biologically-inspired
distributions such as log-normal or correlated center-surround distributions
performed relatively well suggesting a possibility for designing deep neural
network architectures that do not require many data samples to learn, and can
sidestep current training procedures while maintaining or boosting modelling
performance.

 <dc:description>  We make several contributions that quantify the real-time hash rate and
therefore the consensus of a blockchain. We show that by using only the hash
value of blocks, we can estimate and measure the hash rate of all miners or
individual miners, with quanti able accuracy. We apply our techniques to the
Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains; our solution applies to any
proof-of-work-based blockchain that relies on a numeric target for the
validation of blocks. We also show that if miners regularly broadcast status
reports of their partial proof-of- work, the hash rate estimates are signi
cantly more accurate at a cost of slightly higher bandwidth. Whether using only
the blockchain, or the additional information in status reports, merchants can
use our techniques to quantify in real-time the threat of double-spend attacks.

 <dc:title>Disinformation and Social Bot Operations in the Run Up to the 2017

 <dc:description>  Recent accounts from researchers, journalists, as well as federal
investigators, reached a unanimous conclusion: social media are systematically
exploited to manipulate and alter public opinion. Some disinformation campaigns
have been coordinated by means of bots, social media accounts controlled by
computer scripts that try to disguise themselves as legitimate human users. In
this study, we describe one such operation occurred in the run up to the 2017
French presidential election. We collected a massive Twitter dataset of nearly
17 million posts occurred between April 27 and May 7, 2017 (Election Day). We
then set to study the MacronLeaks disinformation campaign: By leveraging a mix
of machine learning and cognitive behavioral modeling techniques, we separated
humans from bots, and then studied the activities of the two groups taken
independently, as well as their interplay. We provide a characterization of
both the bots and the users who engaged with them and oppose it to those users
who didn't. Prior interests of disinformation adopters pinpoint to the reasons
of the scarce success of this campaign: the users who engaged with MacronLeaks
are mostly foreigners with a preexisting interest in alt-right topics and
alternative news media, rather than French users with diverse political views.
Concluding, anomalous account usage patterns suggest the possible existence of
a black-market for reusable political disinformation bots.

 <dc:description>  Recent work on machine learning has begun to consider issues of fairness. In
this paper, we extend the concept of fairness to recommendation. In particular,
we show that in some recommendation contexts, fairness may be a multisided
concept, in which fair outcomes for multiple individuals need to be considered.
Based on these considerations, we present a taxonomy of classes of
fairness-aware recommender systems and suggest possible fairness-aware
recommendation architectures.

 <dc:description>  A key contributing factor to incredible success of deep neural networks has
been the significant rise on massively parallel computing devices allowing
researchers to greatly increase the size and depth of deep neural networks,
leading to significant improvements in modeling accuracy. Although deeper,
larger, or complex deep neural networks have shown considerable promise, the
computational complexity of such networks is a major barrier to utilization in
resource-starved scenarios. We explore the synaptogenesis of deep neural
networks in the formation of efficient deep neural network architectures within
an evolutionary deep intelligence framework, where a probabilistic generative
modeling strategy is introduced to stochastically synthesize increasingly
efficient yet effective offspring deep neural networks over generations,
mimicking evolutionary processes such as heredity, random mutation, and natural
selection in a probabilistic manner. In this study, we primarily explore the
imposition of synaptic precision restrictions and its impact on the
evolutionary synthesis of deep neural networks to synthesize more efficient
network architectures tailored for resource-starved scenarios. Experimental
results show significant improvements in synaptic efficiency (~10X decrease for
GoogLeNet-based DetectNet) and inference speed (&gt;5X increase for
GoogLeNet-based DetectNet) while preserving modeling accuracy.

 <dc:title>Church-Rosser Systems, Codes with Bounded Synchronization Delay and

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  What is the common link, if there is any, between Church-Rosser systems,
prefix codes with bounded synchronization delay, and local Rees extensions? The
first obvious answer is that each of these notions relates to topics of
interest for WORDS: Church-Rosser systems are certain rewriting systems over
words, codes are given by sets of words which form a basis of a free submonoid
in the free monoid of all words (over a given alphabet) and local Rees
extensions provide structural insight into regular languages over words. So, it
seems to be a legitimate title for an extended abstract presented at the
conference WORDS 2017. However, this work is more ambitious, it outlines some
less obvious but much more interesting link between these topics. This link is
based on a structure theory of finite monoids with varieties of groups and the
concept of local divisors playing a prominent role. Parts of this work appeared

 <dc:description>  A binary matrix has the consecutive ones property ($C1P$) for rows (columns)
if there is a permutation of its columns (rows) that arranges the ones
consecutively in all the rows (columns). A binary matrix has the simultaneous
consecutive ones property ($SC1P$) if it has both the $C1P$ for rows and
columns. We consider the following two categories of problems: Simultaneous
Consecutive Ones Submatrix ($SC1S$) and Simultaneous Consecutive Ones Editing
($SC1E$) in a similar spirit as that of Consecutive Ones Submatrix and
Consecutive Ones Editing problems. For a given binary matrix $M$, Consecutive
Ones Submatrix problem decides if there is a submatrix of $M$ that satisfies
the $C1P$ for rows and Consecutive Ones Editing problem decides if there is a
set of $1$-entries of size at most $k$ in $M$ whose flipping results in a
matrix with the $C1P$ for rows. $SC1S$ problems focus on deleting a minimum
number of rows (columns) to establish the $SC1P$ whereas $SC1E$ problem deals
with flipping a minimum number of $1$s to obtain the $SC1P$. We consider the
parameterized versions of $SC1S$ and $SC1E$ problems with $k$ as the parameter
and are defined as follows. Given a binary matrix $M$ and a positive integer
$k$, $k$-$SC1S$-$R$ ($k$-$SC1S$-$C$) problem decides whether there exists a set
of rows (columns) of size at most $k$ whose deletion results in a matrix with
the $SC1P$. The $k$-$SC1P$-$1E$ problem decides whether there exists a set of
$1$-entries of size at most $k$ whose flipping results in a matrix with the
$SC1P$. We show that $k$-$SC1S$-$R$, $k$-$SC1S$-$C$ and $k$-$SC1P$-$1E$ are
fixed-parameter tractable on $(2,*)$-matrices and $(*,2)$-matrices. We observe
that using our algorithm, $k$-$SC1S$-$R$, $k$-$SC1S$-$C$ and $k$-$SC1P$-$1E$
can be approximated in polynomial-time on $(2,*)$-matrices and
$(*,2)$-matrices.

 <dc:description>  Architecture decision making is considered one of the most challenging
cognitive tasks in software development. The objective of this study is to
explore the state of the practice of architecture decision making in software
teams, including the role of the architect and the associated challenges. An
exploratory case study was conducted in a large software company in Europe and
fifteen software architects were interviewed as the primary method of data
collection. The results reveal that the majority of software teams make
architecture decisions collaboratively. Especially, the consultative decision-
making style is preferred as it helps to make decisions efficiently while
taking the opinions of the team members into consideration. It is observed that
most of the software architects maintain a close relationship with the software
teams. Several organisational, process and human related challenges and their
impact on architecture decision-making are also identified.

 <dc:description>  The standard content-based attention mechanism typically used in
sequence-to-sequence models is computationally expensive as it requires the
comparison of large encoder and decoder states at each time step. In this work,
we propose an alternative attention mechanism based on a fixed size memory
representation that is more efficient. Our technique predicts a compact set of
K attention contexts during encoding and lets the decoder compute an efficient
lookup that does not need to consult the memory. We show that our approach
performs on-par with the standard attention mechanism while yielding inference
speedups of 20% for real-world translation tasks and more for tasks with longer
sequences. By visualizing attention scores we demonstrate that our models learn
distinct, meaningful alignments.

 <dc:description>  Several domains have adopted the increasing use of IoT-based devices to
collect sensor data for generating abstractions and perceptions of the real
world. This sensor data is multi-modal and heterogeneous in nature. This
heterogeneity induces interoperability issues while developing cross-domain
applications, thereby restricting the possibility of reusing sensor data to
develop new applications. As a solution to this, semantic approaches have been
proposed in the literature to tackle problems related to interoperability of
sensor data. Several ontologies have been proposed to handle different aspects
of IoT-based sensor data collection, ranging from discovering the IoT sensors
for data collection to applying reasoning on the collected sensor data for
drawing inferences. In this paper, we survey these existing semantic ontologies
to provide an overview of the recent developments in this field. We highlight
the fundamental ontological concepts (e.g., sensor-capabilities and
context-awareness) required for an IoT-based application, and survey the
existing ontologies which include these concepts. Based on our study, we also
identify the shortcomings of currently available ontologies, which serves as a
stepping stone to state the need for a common unified ontology for the IoT
domain.

 <dc:description>  The acknowledged model for networks of collaborations is the hypergraph
model. Nonetheless when it comes to be visualized hypergraphs are transformed
into simple graphs. Very often, the transformation is made by clique expansion
of the hyperedges resulting in a loss of information for the user and in
artificially more complex graphs due to the high number of edges represented.
The extra-node representation gives substantial improvement in the
visualisation of hypergraphs and in the retrieval of information. This paper
aims at showing qualitatively and quantitatively how the extra-node
representation can improve the visualisation of hypergraphs without loss of
information.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce deep learning technology to tackle two
traditional low-level image processing problems, companding and inverse
halftoning. We make two main contributions. First, to the best knowledge of the
authors, this is the first work that has successfully developed deep learning
based solutions to these two traditional low-level image processing problems.
This not only introduces new methods to tackle well-known image processing
problems but also demonstrates the power of deep learning in solving
traditional signal processing problems. Second, we have developed an effective
deep learning algorithm based on insights into the properties of visual quality
of images and the internal representation properties of a deep convolutional
neural network (CNN). We train a deep CNN as a nonlinear transformation
function to map a low bit depth image to higher bit depth or from a halftone
image to a continuous tone image. We also employ another pretrained deep CNN as
a feature extractor to derive visually important features to construct the
objective function for the training of the mapping CNN. We present experimental
results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new deep learning based
solutions.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a Semantic Attribute Modulation (SAM) for language
modeling and style variation. The semantic attribute modulation includes
various document attributes, such as titles, authors, and document categories.
We consider two types of attributes, (title attributes and category
attributes), and a flexible attribute selection scheme by automatically scoring
them via an attribute attention mechanism. The semantic attributes are embedded
into the hidden semantic space as the generation inputs. With the attributes
properly harnessed, our proposed SAM can generate interpretable texts with
regard to the input attributes. Qualitative analysis, including word semantic
analysis and attention values, shows the interpretability of SAM. On several
typical text datasets, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of the
Semantic Attribute Modulated language model with different combinations of
document attributes. Moreover, we present a style variation for the lyric
generation using SAM, which shows a strong connection between the style
variation and the semantic attributes.

 <dc:description>  A generalized 1-in-3SAT problem is defined and found to be in complexity
class P when restricted to a certain subset of CNF expressions. In particular,
1-in-kSAT with no restrictions on the number of literals per clause can be
decided in polynomial time when restricted to exact READ-3 formulas with equal
number of clauses (m) and variables (n), and no pure literals. Also individual
instances can be checked for easiness with respect to a given SAT problem. By
identifying whole classes of formulas as being solvable efficiently the
approach might be of interest also in the complementary search for hard
instances.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problems of minimizing sum power and
maximizing sum rate for multi-cell networks with load coupling, where coupling
relation occurs among cells due to inter-cell interference. This coupling
relation is characterized by the signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR)
coupling model with cell load vector and cell power vector as the variables.
Due to the nonlinear SINR coupling model, the optimization problems for
multi-cell networks with load coupling is nonconvex. To solve these nonconvex
problems, we first consider the optimization problems for single-cell networks.
Through variable transformations, the optimization problems can be equivalently
transformed into convex problems. By solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT), the
optimal solutions to power minimization and rate maximization problems can be
obtained in closed form. Based on the theoretical findings of optimization
problems for single-cell networks, we develop a distributed time allocation and
power control algorithm with low complexity for sum power minimization in
multi-cell networks. This algorithm is proved to be convergent and globally
optimal by using the properties of standard interference function. For sum rate
optimization in multi-cell networks, we also provide a distributed algorithm
which yields suboptimal solution. Besides, the convergence for this distributed
algorithm is proved. Numerical results illustrate the theoretical findings,
showing the superiority of our solutions compared to the conventional solution
of allocating uniform power for users in the same cell.

 <dc:description>  Deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have significant potential for
dialogue policy optimisation. However, they suffer from a poor performance in
the early stages of learning. This is especially problematic for on-line
learning with real users. Two approaches are introduced to tackle this problem.
Firstly, to speed up the learning process, two sample-efficient neural networks
algorithms: trust region actor-critic with experience replay (TRACER) and
episodic natural actor-critic with experience replay (eNACER) are presented.
For TRACER, the trust region helps to control the learning step size and avoid
catastrophic model changes. For eNACER, the natural gradient identifies the
steepest ascent direction in policy space to speed up the convergence. Both
models employ off-policy learning with experience replay to improve
sample-efficiency. Secondly, to mitigate the cold start issue, a corpus of
demonstration data is utilised to pre-train the models prior to on-line
reinforcement learning. Combining these two approaches, we demonstrate a
practical approach to learn deep RL-based dialogue policies and demonstrate
their effectiveness in a task-oriented information seeking domain.

 <dc:title>Employing Emotion Cues to Verify Speakers in Emotional Talking
  Environments</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shahin, Ismail</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Usually, people talk neutrally in environments where there are no abnormal
talking conditions such as stress and emotion. Other emotional conditions that
might affect people talking tone like happiness, anger, and sadness. Such
emotions are directly affected by the patient health status. In neutral talking
environments, speakers can be easily verified, however, in emotional talking
environments, speakers cannot be easily verified as in neutral talking ones.
Consequently, speaker verification systems do not perform well in emotional
talking environments as they do in neutral talking environments. In this work,
a two-stage approach has been employed and evaluated to improve speaker
verification performance in emotional talking environments. This approach
employs speaker emotion cues (text-independent and emotion-dependent speaker
verification problem) based on both Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and
Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Models (SPHMMs) as classifiers. The approach is
comprised of two cascaded stages that combines and integrates emotion
recognizer and speaker recognizer into one recognizer. The architecture has
been tested on two different and separate emotional speech databases: our
collected database and Emotional Prosody Speech and Transcripts database. The
results of this work show that the proposed approach gives promising results
with a significant improvement over previous studies and other approaches such
as emotion-independent speaker verification approach and emotion-dependent
speaker verification approach based completely on HMMs.

proposed models have been tested on our collected speech database using
Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). Our results demonstrate that HMM3s
significantly improve speaker identification performance in such talking
environments by 11.3% and 166.7% compared to second-order hidden Markov models
(HMM2s) and first-order hidden Markov models (HMM1s), respectively. The
achieved results based on the proposed models are close to those obtained in
subjective assessment by human listeners.

 <dc:description>  Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a fundamental problem in
machine learning and computer vision. An ANNS algorithm is required to be
efficient on both memory use and search performance. Recently, graph based
methods have achieved revolutionary performance on public datasets. The
earliest approach GNNS is a greedy algorithm and based on a
$k$-nearest-neighbor graph ($k$NN graph). The improvements of GNNS mainly focus
on two aspects: (1) Some provide better initial search position to prevent the
search from being stuck in local optima. (2) Others try to construct better
graphs for faster traversing and neighbor locating. However, we find there
exists three problems with these works, the unconnected cluster problem, the
detouring problem and the large index problem (memory-inefficient for large
scale search). In this paper, we present a novel graph structure named
Navigating Spreading-out Graph (NSG) to tackle above three problems
simultaneously, without introducing any other index structures. Extensive
experiments show that our algorithm outperforms all the existing algorithms
significantly. What's more, our algorithm outperforms the existing approach of
Taobao (Alibaba Group), and has been integrated into their search engine for
billion scale search.

 <dc:description>  Background: The sensitivity of Requirements Engineering (RE) to the context
makes it difficult to efficiently control problems therein, thus, hampering an
effective risk management devoted to allow for early corrective or even
preventive measures. Problem: There is still little empirical knowledge about
context-specific RE phenomena which would be necessary for an effective
context- sensitive risk management in RE. Goal: We propose and validate an
evidence-based approach to assess risks in RE using cross-company data about
problems, causes and effects. Research Method: We use survey data from 228
companies and build a probabilistic network that supports the forecast of
context-specific RE phenomena. We implement this approach using spreadsheets to
support a light-weight risk assessment. Results: Our results from an initial
validation in 6 companies strengthen our confidence that the approach increases
the awareness for individual risk factors in RE, and the feedback further
allows for disseminating our approach into practice.

 <dc:description>  In this research, we model and analyze the vocal tract under normal and
stressful talking conditions. This research answers the question of the
degradation in the recognition performance of text-dependent speaker
identification under stressful talking conditions. This research can be used
(for future research) to improve the recognition performance under stressful
talking conditions.
